560015 that your government has increased aid to the palestinian authority this was seen as a big deal by the quartet something john howard would not have done and a sign perhaps of a different approach by kevin rudd on israel
560016 thats an even handed approach which labor has had as its policy for a long period of time its a two nation solution thats even handed
560017 contrasts with the previous government which tilted australias middle east policy towards israel and made little pretence of adhering to an even handed approach
560018 it wasnt so long ago jewish labor supporters were arguing there was no difference between liberal and labor policy towards israel and jews who attended private dinners with kevin rudd in toorak and other private homes were led to believe labor would continue to support israel

560053 do i really want to go that difficult place of a son struggling to honour the pain of losing a father who has been suddenly taken from him
560054 as a father i sometimes pause and reflect on what legacy i would like to leave my children i ask myself what gift can i give that will lay a firm foundation for them to build their lives on i need look no further to find the answer if it is true that a life of example speaks the clearest then there can be no question that my fathers life spoke with clarity it spoke with a resonance consistent with his deep belief in god his family hard work and a ripping good laugh
560055 i feel if i can emulate him trying in my own way to be the kind of man he was then i shall come closer to giving to my own sons the necessary values and foundation they will need to live life in this world
560056 i will always be grateful for the father i had i will try for the sake of my own sons to become equal to his example

560064 the man cleared of murdering bbc tv presenter jill dando has said his past behaviour of pestering women fuelled police suspicions about him
560065 barry george 48 told the news of the world he could not have killed miss dando because he was stalking another woman at the time
560066 but in another interview with the sunday mirror he said he was a changed man and would no longer follow women
560067 during police surveillance in the three weeks before his arrest in may 2000 mr george was seen approaching 38 women near his home in fulham london and trying to make conversation with them
560068 officers later found 2 248 photographs he had taken of women he had followed
560069 i dont want people to always say theres barry george he killed jill dando
560070 i want them to say theres barry george he didnt kill jill dando
560071 german doctors have carried out a complete double arm transplant
560072 the patient was a 54 year old farmer who lost his limbs in an accident six years ago
560073 the donor is believed to be a teenager who had died shortly before the surgery neither mans name has been released by the munich clinic
560074 the 15 hour operation took place last week and the patient is recovering well though it could be two years before he can move his new hands
560075 uk transplant expert nadey hakim head of the transplant unit at londons hammersmith hospital said the higher up an amputation on the arms the easier it was to connect new limbs as there were fewer nerves and only one bone to connect
560076 flexing and bending the arm is also going to be hard
560077 he is going to require intensive physiotherapy every day for many months
560078 a 12 year old girl who fell 14 floors down a chimney in her apartment block in new york was saved by a pile of soot at the bottom
560079 grace bergere suffered no internal injuries when she landed in 2ft 60cm of soot in the basement furnace of the building in the west village area
560080 she had taken a visiting cousin up to the rooftop to admire the view of the hudson river
560081 the buildings janitor said he was glad he had not had the chimney swept
560082 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
560083 while her father screamed her name fire fighters opened a metal door at the bottom of the chimney fearing the worst
560084 instead they saw graces little hand poking out of the soot
560085 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
560086 she was covered in soot she was black all over
560087 for example auras around humans have been photographed so nobody can deny their existence what we know about the universe is only the tip of an iceberg we can just see that wee bit above the water and a little bit below it what lies underneath unknown is bigger than what most of us can even imagine
560088 even if you were to place the same ingredients in front of your own photograph the roti would form
560089 this may sound blasphemous but also a little beer to a statue of gandhi
560090 whenever a miracle takes place there is an economic or social beneficiary
560091 but where are there no scams science has clear biases ignores inconvenient facts and has its share of utter frauds
560092 all of us love miracles irrespective of our community and religion in fact we long for them being born and brought up to believe that miracles do happen we accept anything thats even mildly suggestive of a miracle our lives revolve around expectations that miracles can happen for instance take the recent case of the statue of shirdi sai baba opening his eye in bangalore people thronged the place to witness it thats human weakness at the same time not all of them who went there believed in it most of them were driven to do it only out of curiosity but the very fact that they wanted to be a part of the whole episode illustrates how a human mind works they went there out of expectations they wanted to believe that the miracle had indeed happened
560093 it is basic human tendency to desire the marvellous and the wondrous to be deluded about them to fabricate them embellish them and to exaggerate them it is a manifestation of our dislike for the mundane and the ordinary hence we lap up anything that is different from the ordinary
560094 its true that there is no scientific basis to miracles but everything cannot be explained by science right
560095 my father was a hale and hearty person one fine morning we found him dead in his sleep and the doctors attributed it to a massive heart attack my mother was devastated everyday she reported of having his visions prompting her to take her bp tablets according to her she distinctly saw him walking in the house with his familiar and recognisable steady gait one such day she told us she had decided to join him we didnt take her seriously as we thought it was just another of her emotional outpourings but the very same night to our horror she too passed away peacefully in her sleep how do you explain this
560096 anything we do with intensity can create miracles when we understand it it forms the basis of life when it surprises us we call it a miracle
560097 they are all around us we just have to ask the universe for it i have prayed for miracles and they have happened the universe is very kind it just gives all that you ask for you may be gripped by a serious problem and not know how to get out of it you hope against hope for it to be resolved by itself and it does thats a miracle
560098 i had also on the same trip witnessed a healing by him on a boy who was afflicted with a disease which had left him deformed from neck to toe when sai baba whispered something into his ear he dashed off unaided towards his room a distance of 15 metres in a split second and turned contorted again a few hours later i saw this boy walking about awkwardly but proudly around with the most radiant smile upon his face unaided watched by his ecstatic mother he was not even able to stand up on his own prior to sai babas interaction with him until a few hours earlier that was the other miracle i witnessed this is for those who might want to rubbish my earlier claim of my miracle as a psychological abberation or fluke
560099 now miracles happen most when we are desperate or troubled and indeed we are in trouble today with an imminent collapse of the environment and a global economy powered by skinny energy resources since mans very survival is threatened the stakes are raised our desperation unleashes immense psychic force and so miracles and psychic gifts are far easier to receive today than in any point in our history

560103 this book is worth reading and all these others arent
560104 you find that there are many people who are depending on this person who are looking up to this person and who see this persons success as their own success
560105 as you go up the ladder its not always easy to simply say to them ok now im in this new position
560106 a lot of players get in trouble because they want everyone around them to lead the same lifestyle
560107 you buy this big house for people and they no longer want to drive the low end car to go with the big house so the big house leads to the big car to the better clothes to the better restaurants and stuff its a snowball effect you see how guys live
560108 my concern is there may be a lot of other mothers not be getting paid and i would like my client to be at front of the line
560109 this is such a small amount given the scope of what he has
560110 if evander holyfield can get away with it anybody can there are guys making 15 000 a year who go to jail for missing a 100 payment
560111 it wasnt like they told her hold on hold your breath well get it to you were just having some accounting difficulties
560112 it was like hes not paying and we dont know if or when hes going to pay you again
560113 when people bring up foreclosure and bankruptcy im not that concerned
560114 what that does is free up money for child support if they foreclose on his house that means he doesnt have to pay the mortgage if he goes bankrupt that frees up some other obligations
560115 theres certain people in your life you realise arent exactly the people that you thought they were
560116 its pretty full on for me its quite shocking it has shattered me as a person
560117 they are disrespecting me and degrading my relationship with dean theyve hooked me up with every ex ive ever had or any guy ive talked to since the announcement
560118 with all the hoo ha thats gone on this week between jess and i we cant wait to get back there actually
560119 there has just been so much stress on us that were kind of just looking forward to getting away from it all now
560120 i was always a protective mum but now i cant let my daughter walk down a different aisle when we are shopping and i have panic attacks
560121 im glad hes not in napier but hes a ticking time bomb and should be locked up
560122 the system failed me and my daughter they not only let me down they put my daughter at risk which is unacceptable
560123 he was supposed to be under 24 hour supervision and was to have two trackers if he left the property
560124 yet he was able to jump the fence into my property and stalk my five year old daughter for 10 days
560125 it was only because i am a protective mum anyway that i found out who he was before something happened
560126 when i did find out who he was and what he had done i hit the roof
560127 we always have a good bullpen and with rauch here were even better hopefully we can keep doing good
560128 salter is still mccains chief wordsmith as well as a top campaign operative and for all practical purposes mccains brain
560129 salters just spent so much time with mccain that i dont know if mccains figured out salter or salters figured out mccain
560130 but nothing seems to rile up salter like obama himself
560131 presumption that i am blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need
560132 that life doesnt count for much unless youre willing to do your small part to leave our children all of our children a better world even if its difficult even if the work seems great even if we dont get very far in our lifetime
560133 i often regret that we didnt copyright serving a cause greater than your self interest
560134 dear senator obama i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
560135 salter is the main architect via the many books and speeches of what you might call the mccain code
560136 is not an introspective or contemplative guy but he has instincts or a code of behavior that i guess is a kind of philosophy
560137 a few months after he returned home from vietnam in 1973 john mccain wrote a 12 000 word account of his five and a half years captivity in a vietnamese prison for u
560138 the oriental as you may know likes to beat around the bush quite a bit
560139 a lot of the guards were homosexual although never toward us
560140 now i see more of an appreciation of our way of life there is more patriotism the flag is all over the place
560141 there is an elaborate record of the principles and beliefs that govern mccains thinking about politics and policy in the five books he and salter have written scores of speeches they have collaborated on over nearly two decades and countless interviews including one last week for this article
560142 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
560143 enter public life determined to tell the truth to put problem solving ahead of partisanship to defend the public interest against the special interests to risk your personal ambitions for the sake of the country and the ideals that make her great keep your promise to america and you will keep your honor you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure
560144 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
560145 and obama too according to salters view of him violates the mccain code in nearly every way he is vain but not experienced his campaign is focused on an individual not the greater good he has not demonstrated real courage in life or politics
560146 every morning in africa a gazelle wakes up it knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed every morning a lion wakes up it knows it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death it doesnt matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle when the sun comes up youd better be running
560147 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
560148 there will always be a part and always a very large part of every community that have no care but for themselves and whose care for themselves reaches little further than impatience of immediate pain and eagerness for the nearest good
560149 to be amused by what you read that is the great spring of happy quotations
560150 the only thing to do with good advice is pass it on it is never any use to oneself
560151 one of the indictments of civilizations is that happiness and intelligence are so rarely found in the same person
560152 theres so much pollution in the air now that if it werent for our lungs thered be no place to put it all
560153 a hat should be taken off when you greet a lady and left off for the rest of your life nothing looks more stupid than a hat
560154 the trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of ones time defending scoundrels for it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all
560155 americans will put up with anything provided it doesnt block traffic
560156 you watch him now and he trusts what hes doing
560157 he trusts that he can cut the ball lose get extension and finish pitches and its not going to hurt
560158 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
560159 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
560160 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
560161 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
560162 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
560163 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
560164 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
560165 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
560166 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
560167 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
560168 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
560169 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
560170 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
560171 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
560172 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
560173 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
560174 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
560175 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
560176 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
560177 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
560178 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
560179 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
560180 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
560181 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
560182 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
560183 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
560184 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
560185 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
560186 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
560187 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
560188 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
560189 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
560190 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
560191 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
560192 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
560193 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
560194 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
560195 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
560196 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
560197 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
560198 beware of those powers which come from god but which can so easily be purloined by the devil
560199 a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural or exceptional powers or qualities
560200 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
560201 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
560202 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
560203 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
560204 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
560205 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
560206 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
560207 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
560208 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
560209 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
560210 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
560211 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
560212 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
560213 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
560214 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
560215 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
560216 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
560217 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
560218 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
560219 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
560220 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
560221 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
560222 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
560223 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
560224 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
560225 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
560226 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
560227 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
560228 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
560229 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
560230 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
560231 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
560232 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
560233 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
560234 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
560235 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
560236 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
560237 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
560238 it was made into a bad movie in the 1970s starring the admirable george c scott
560239 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
560240 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
560241 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described
560242 it used to have a four cylinder flathead chrysler diesel engine but someone replaced it with a v8 general motors gasoline car engine it turned the boat into a virtual bomb it looked like a bucket of rusty bolts so i sent some guys to move it to a good boatyard
560243 it was 12 knots on a boat which was not seaworthy after a nine hour journey we navigated in by torchlight to the new yard
560244 we will then take her to an undisclosed location and protect her like an unborn child
560245 but it means that you will see 27m of the 32m on the screen there are certain things that are meant to be and if youre lucky enough in life to eventually get there then that is a great achievement this is the project that is meant to be for me
560246 i put a lot of myself in to those roles
560247 in the valley of elah was an important film because we were looking at how the iraq war impacts on local communities across america with the loss of family members its a tragedy that carries on
560248 he is so focused tommy never wants to waste time and sometimes we were having a bit too much fun for him
560249 my belief is that we should never waste a day
560250 and when you are working and acting is our work there should be total concentration on what you are trying to achieve anything less than that then you are cheating yourself and short changing others
560251 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
560252 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
560253 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
560254 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
560255 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
560256 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
560257 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different
560258 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
560259 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
560260 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
560261 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
560262 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
560263 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
560264 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
560265 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
560266 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
560267 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
560268 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
560269 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
560270 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
560271 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
560272 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
560273 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
560274 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
560275 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
560276 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
560277 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
560278 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
560279 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
560280 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
560281 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
560282 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
560283 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
560284 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
560285 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
560286 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
560287 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
560288 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
560289 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
560290 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
560291 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
560292 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
560293 you know its not about you its about your country
560294 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
560295 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
560296 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
560297 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
560298 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
560299 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
560300 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
560301 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
560302 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
560303 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
560304 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
560305 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
560306 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
560307 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
560308 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
560309 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
560310 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
560311 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
560312 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
560313 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
560314 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
560315 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
560316 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
560317 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
560318 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
560319 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
560320 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
560321 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
560322 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
560323 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
560324 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
560325 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
560326 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
560327 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
560328 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
560329 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
560330 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
560331 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
560332 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
560333 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
560334 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
560335 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
560336 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
560337 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
560338 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
560339 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
560340 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
560341 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
560342 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
560343 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
560344 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
560345 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
560346 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
560347 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
560348 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
560349 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
560350 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
560351 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
560352 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
560353 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
560354 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
560355 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
560356 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
560357 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
560358 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
560359 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
560360 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
560361 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
560362 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
560363 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
560364 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
560365 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
560366 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
560367 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
560368 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
560369 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
560370 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
560371 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
560372 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
560373 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
560374 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
560375 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
560376 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
560377 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
560378 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
560379 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
560380 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
560381 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
560382 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
560383 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
560384 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
560385 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
560386 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
560387 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
560388 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
560389 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
560390 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
560391 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
560392 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
560393 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
560394 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
560395 i think we should be in a post racial environment
560396 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
560397 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
560398 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
560399 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons amp dragons
560400 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
560401 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
560402 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
560403 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
560404 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
560405 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
560406 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
560407 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
560408 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
560409 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
560410 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
560411 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
560412 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
560413 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
560414 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
560415 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
560416 everybodys trying to figure out how to lower levels of acrylamide without significantly adversely affecting taste
560417 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
560418 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
560419 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
560420 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
560421 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
560422 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
560423 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
560424 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
560425 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
560426 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
560427 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
560428 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
560429 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
560430 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
560431 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
560432 ive looked at a number of other specimens sat in a few other wagner auctions but this is the one that makes collecting worth while
560433 since i was 8 years old ive hoped and dreamed that one day id be able to get one
560434 the mystique and allure of the t206 wagner card continues to grow
560435 pretty much the one thing that i didnt want to happen happened
560436 i came here after a trade and got hurt its really disappointing that i cant help the team its frustrating but you have to deal with it and try to come back as soon as possible and try to be healthy
560437 im starting to throw on sunday and well progress from there and see how it goes
560438 right now hopefully i can get back for september i havent thrown in a while so the throwing program is going to take a little bit well just take it day by day see how it feels and hopefully i can get back and pitch a couple of games at the end of the year
560439 i wasnt miserable i dont know where they got that
560440 the thing you miss the most is the guys youre with them every day i dont miss the weather
560441 especially when i get traded for five guys theres a lot of expectations you just go out there and do what you can
560442 its only hard for the first couple of weeks you try to get to know everybody and their names
560443 its frustrating for something to happen like that and for him to go through that
560444 you try to do that your whole life being a baseball player and being a pitcher and now he just cant do it anymore and hes young its frustrating for him and its frustrating for the people that know him he tries hard to do his job and now he cant do it hopefully he can do it like rick ankiel thats a great story and hopefully it can happen again i wish him all the best
560445 so in order for him to not be out there theres got to be something wrong with him i know he likes to pitch and he loves to compete i think he likes a challenge its unfortunate for the game not the orioles or seattle i think its unfortunate that the fans in baseball dont get to see him pitch on a regular basis if they did i think everybody would come to appreciate what he brings every time out there hes pretty darned good
560446 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
560447 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
560448 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
560449 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
560450 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
560451 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
560452 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
560453 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
560454 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
560455 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
560456 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
560457 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
560458 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
560459 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
560460 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
560461 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
560462 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
560463 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
560464 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
560465 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
560466 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
560467 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
560468 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
560469 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
560470 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
560471 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
560472 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
560473 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
560474 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
560475 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
560476 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
560477 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
560478 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
560479 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
560480 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
560481 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
560482 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
560483 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
560484 when we first sketched out this concept of the monthly luncheons july was for the 80s
560485 we said all right july 31 arizona comes to town so were going to have to do the luncheon on july 33 and extend july a couple of days
560486 we didnt know if kirk could do it we didnt know if hed be available if hed be willing to wearing a diamondbacks jersey but the plan always was to select this day so that it would be as easy as possible were thrilled and grateful that was a chills moment
560487 as a manger for the team i never hit any balls for them i never struck anybody out but what success i achieved became a reality only because of these guys to get into the hall of fame you have to be a winner how did i get there these guys put me there i love being around them
560488 its a good chance to reminisce with all the people who cheered for you and all that and its good to come back because they havent forgotten i think they appreciated in that era a lot of hard work and thats i think what distinguished our teams maybe from others they liked the hard work that they saw
560489 that to me is the fact that cancer so many things hit so many different households and that people understand when theyre starting to speak out about it its not a secret
560490 its only a secret if it hasnt affected your household but its hitting more households than people realize those are the people that really understand that we need to find a cure
560491 and the mccourts are second to none in appreciating and respecting how your former players restore that love with your fans who then transmit that love to your current players who then feel that love and it creates memories that you want to celebrate 20 years from now and thats how you perpetuate the game
560492 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
560493 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
560494 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
560495 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
560496 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
560497 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
560498 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
560499 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
560500 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
560501 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
560502 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
560503 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
560504 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
560505 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
560506 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
560507 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
560508 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
560509 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
560510 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
560511 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
560512 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
560513 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
560514 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
560515 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
560516 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
560517 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
560518 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
560519 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
560520 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
560521 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
560522 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
560523 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
560524 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
560525 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
560526 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
560527 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
560528 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
560529 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
560530 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
560531 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
560532 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
560533 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
560534 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
560535 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
560536 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
560537 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
560538 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
560539 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
560540 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
560541 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
560542 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
560543 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
560544 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
560545 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
560546 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
560547 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
560548 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
560549 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
560550 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
560551 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
560552 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
560553 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
560554 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
560555 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
560556 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
560557 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
560558 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
560559 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
560560 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
560561 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
560562 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
560563 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
560564 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
560565 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
560566 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
560567 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
560568 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
560569 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
560570 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
560571 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
560572 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
560573 can sometimes take us to far away from the reason that we support barack obamas candidacy i wanted us all to remember that we can make a difference in other peoples lives if we have the will to help
560574 what can i do to make this person worship me
560575 thats not true youre not ugly unless you say you are beauty is in the eye of the beholder
560576 how dare you how self absorbed that makes people who are less attractive than you feel bad
560577 thats a criticism i would take it as a compliment
560578 the realization of oneself is the prime aim of life and to realize oneself through pleasure is finer than to do so through pain
560579 to become a spectator of ones own life is to escape the suffering of life
560580 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
560581 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
560582 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
560583 i had no father in my life and was largely brought up by grandparents just like barack obama
560584 the thing thats beautiful about the american dream is that its colorblind
560585 the american dream is in disarray i dont feel we serve the hard working people vital to this country anymore
560586 senator obama gives us a chance to restore hope to restore faith to restore compassion to the white house he speaks from the heart he speaks from his desire for change
560587 another item i want to touch on pertains to a cover story in a recent
560588 do your work then step back the only path to serenity
560589 but those who are ready to toil in the most excellent pursuits will not desist from the search after truth till they get the demonstration from the scriptures themselves
560590 scripture has absolute authority whatever it teaches is necessarily true and woe betide befall him who accepts doctrines not discoverable in it
560591 for concerning the divine and holy mysteries of the faith not even a casual statement must be delivered without the holy scriptures nor must we be drawn aside my mere plausibility and artifices of speech even to me who tell thee these things give not absolute credence unless thou receive the proof of the things which i announce from the divine scriptures
560592 we make the holy scriptures the rule and the measure of every tenet we necessarily fix our eyes upon that and approve that alone which may be made to harmonize with the intention of those writings
560593 vainly do they run about with the pretext that they have demanded councils for the faiths sake for divine scripture is sufficient above all things
560594 terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a greater grip in pakistan
560595 are gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place in south asia
560596 this energy efficiency drive serves as our care and commitment from all elements of west java people to use energy efficiently
560597 this clean amp green program intertwines with the energy efficiency drive which also promotes the use of environmentally friendly energy among our people
560598 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
560599 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
560600 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
560601 they have gotten such control over the residents through fear and intimidation that if you dont keep your mouth shut if youre a whistle blower they want you out of there
560602 ive got 74 in the bank no place to go and three clips and a 45
560603 im just waiting for someone to take a shot at me
560604 also regrettable but i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is we have a greater opportunity to work in a cooperative way with china
560605 we understand as the dalai lama does that tibet is part of china but we hope tibetans are not repressed or oppressed
560606 you dont want to go over there and insult the chinese
560607 it would not be good for our relations i certainly dont think the president would or should go over there and be confrontational at the same time i think the president can in a very diplomatic style make it clear what we stand for and believe in
560608 i see a steady progression in russia of more and more repression of rights and the disappearance of semblances of democracy
560609 we have to deal with them negotiate with them especially in light of their hoard of petrodollars but we cant sit by and watch a country murder people in england
560610 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
560611 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
560612 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
560613 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
560614 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
560615 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
560616 this is my life now and i was eager to get back to it and i couldnt be happier
560617 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth
560618 the lesson here is that this is what foreign policy ought to be about
560619 its just a prejudice about mixing porn and blogging that stops me thats my fault not yours

560634 i like it here im looking for peace i want to stay here at the end of the season if the dodgers want me to end my career here well sit down and talk time will tell
560635 after the game friday night i went out to dinner and nobody bothers you in boston you go from the stadium straight home thats what im talking about some people recognized me said congratulations thats it i could go to the movies with my family ive got nothing against boston but this is what im looking for the game is supposed to be fun
560636 its hard for him to know that after one game but i left new york and the first day at spring training i loved it with the dodgers

560642 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him

560644 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
560645 we would not house someone who has finished the military commissions process back with the general detainee population they would be held separate from the other detainees
560646 whats the purpose here mr hamdan is going to be held until the government wants to release him
560647 guilty or convicted or whatever they would be housed in a different facility
560648 its a great question im not faced with it yet weve thought that through and we have plans to accommodate but ill cross that bridge when i come to it

560652 therefore on a matter of principle i cannot support the proposal in the bill for pre charge detention of 42 days
560653 our legislation covering the security service refers to the protection of parliamentary democracy i have a plea handling national security should as far as possible be above party politics as it has been for most of my career

560657 the us treasury departments action against the iiro further undermined american standing in the arab muslim world by continuing what appears to many to be a war on islam
560658 there is unequal enforcement of anti terrorist laws in the us and that this treatment of muslim charities hurts rather than helps the war on terrorism

560715 how does it feel to be the best player never to have won a wgc
560716 it would be nice to win a wgc it really would
560717 i havent really thought about it too much i think maybe 20 years from now or 30 years from now theyll have prestige much like i think the guys who first won the masters had no idea what this tournament was going to become
560718 i have no idea where the wgcs will be 30 years from now they started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about like a major
560719 but they are always the best fields in the game theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests of golf so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those yeah
560720 i just wanted to try it one more time to convince myself thats what needs to get done
560721 what makes the decision hard is the unknown am i going to have an injury or an illness or something that i cant forecast now

560723 although roughly 6 million u s citizens are eligible to vote oversees using absentee ballots many of whom are serving in the military only a fraction of their ballots are being counted

560725 other studies have looked at pregnancy rates but what is really important is whether or not there is a baby

560733 the killing of a tree spirit is always associated with a revival or resurrection of him in a more youthful and vigorous form
560734 as i can attest from my own experience of it
560735 the forests were literally everywhere italy gaul spain britain the ancient mediterranean basin as a whole
560736 mass clearings of land for building and agricultural use had profound ecological implications even in antiquity as forest after forest was demolished and the soils of once fertile lands eroded
560737 but the latter were by no means merely imaginary in status during the middle ages such men and women as well would every now and then be discovered in the forest usually insane people who had taken to the woods if hunters happened upon a wild man they would frequently try to capture him alive and bring him back for people to marvel and wonder at
560738 i learned that theres a whole lot of support in this community
560739 they looked our address up i didnt give it to them
560740 i think that it has been a long summer for him
560741 i have never seen him grow or become so sincerely enthusiastic as this summer and i think graduation was a part of that
560742 god usually puts things better than i do and i thought this would be good for a few of us to hear
560743 i didnt want to write too much about the situation because it would be like i was attacking the school i came very close to saying nothing
560744 i read some comments about how selfish andrew webster and i were for trying to steal graduation day
560745 i never felt like i was in a position where i was threatened ive definitely felt opposed at times
560746 im kind of outgoing anyway i like to meet new people
560747 i am sick and tired of being quiet about my faith and being shot down
560748 people have a right to speak and i get very angry when people cant speak what they want
560749 will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights
560750 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
560751 seriously seeking to increase the size of joint investments to more than 3 billion over the next years
560752 lets face it the average individual american has little or no clout with congress and can be safely ignored but its a different story with groups such as the environmental defense fund sierra club and nature conservancy t hey are well organized loaded with cash and well positioned their political and economic success has been a near disaster for our nation
560753 estuvimos reunidos con el mono vistas las circunstancias decidimos que lo mejor era cambiar el servidor y buscar uno m s grande
560754 a nosotros nos lleg la propuesta los comandantes quieren analizarla
560755 los amigos militares transmitieron la propuesta a trav s de un contacto que ayuda con cositas que se necesitan armas y el mono aprob que aldinever y roma a se apersonaran del tema
560756 ser a un planteamiento interesante que toca mirar en profundidad
560757 si a m me llamaran oficialmente para sentarme a hablar con la guerrilla ir a porque los pol ticos buscan intereses pol ticos que son figurar y los militares pretendemos que haya paz
560758 no necesariamente buscan la paz sino tambi n alg n beneficio econ mico
560759 no clever arrangement of bad eggs ever made a good omelet
560760 as prime minister i bear ultimate responsibility for every decision there are many excellent people in the country and together with them i have championed far reaching daring and complex processes most of them are unknown to the majority of the public but they are well known to those who were part of the decision making and operational process
560761 we must leave the small considerations aside and create unity both inwardly and outwardly
560762 i believe that the internal divisions we have become accustomed to and the idea that different parties have such extremely different ideologies and agendas is a thing of the past and is no longer the case there is a common agenda that every party can put forward on political issues and also on dealing with the threats we face
560763 kadima is a party of failures we must let the public choose particularly at such a critical juncture we need to let the people decide who will lead them
560764 assembling such a government will serve many interests in the knesset but not the interests of the country the current government is dysfunctional its make up is wrong the coalition is unstable people are undisciplined and there is utter anarchy in votes
560765 when cleaning your home you must always make sure that you have
560766 because we are not used to this kind of event just the gruesomeness of it is a bit like experiencing an earthquake the ground beneath you psychologically never feels quite secure again
560767 it is in times of distress that ones courage is understood

560771 you see these two gentlemen im so happy to have them on the team theyre capable of taking us where we have to go
560772 with any situation like this you really cant discuss it publicly
560773 resolved by tomorrow i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
560774 when hes healthy he doesnt throw picks that was not characteristic of chad pennington
560775 la formaci n deja mucho que desear necesitamos m s profesionalismo si con los alumnos no podemos experimentar todo el fracaso escolar el abandono el bajo nivel como para acceder a la educaci n superior exigen bases mejores el punto nuclear de la educaci n est en la formaci n de los educadores
560776 los gobiernos no apoyan la formaci n constante de los educadores algo fundamental si se exige al profesor responder a los nuevos retos de la sociedad del conocimiento es una misi n demasiado trascendente como para que el docente pueda decir que en 4 a os termin su formaci n la universidad tiene que formar un profesor que sepa pensar aprender y motivar el sistema es muy est tico y eso es desmotivante para el alumno necesitamos una escuela abierta creativa y profesionalizada
560777 all we do right now with this fault system is throw gasoline on an already flammable situation
560778 i think its problematic when you force people to lay blame on the other spouse
560779 one of the most common complaints was the length of time and the cost in obtaining a divorce
560780 weve become a culture when the going gets tough the tough go quitting
560781 does my catholic upbringing influence my thinking on this my answer is absolutely yes
560782 it the current law is archaic and ancient and i dont think it serves the public well at all so im very much in favor of reform
560783 we have very narrow grounds for divorce in the state of new york and that causes people to have to invent reasons
560784 the thing that the bradley bill takes into account is that sometimes its no ones fault
560785 in eight years no one not a constituent or a lobbying group has come up to me and asked me to do anything about divorce laws
560786 right now its taxes and thats the number one issue thats what were hearing about and that is what im working on
560787 we have to make sure the economic issues of equitable distribution of marital property alimony child support spousal visitation and other related issues have to be resolved by the parties
560788 i think we have intelligent people in new york that once they make up their minds that they dont want to be married anymore let them be unmarried
560789 what we are going out to do is to learn
560790 this is our last opportunity to visit a summer games before london 2012 itself
560791 we are going to learn about the issues around providing healthcare for athletes and spectators in a live summer games
560792 i am just going to see the medical side of it
560793 it is a case of fly in work round seeing how the hospitals are set up how the care for the athletes in the villages is set up and how the care for the spectators is set up
560794 then we can bring all of our experiences together and collate them and make sure that the things we identify we can solve before london 2012 happens
560795 i think we see people playing tennis every time wimbledon is on but what we fail to do is sustain that enthusiasm
560796 people get interested for a while what we need to do after the olympics is to ensure that interest is sustained
560797 everyone will be getting into the swimming pool or cycling or jogging round the track during the olympics or a short time afterwards but we need to ensure that is sustained
560798 it is about setting real achievable goals for people and accepting the idea that most people who compete are not going to win the 100m
560799 if you can get the schools local community and parents interested you will crack a lot of the obesity problems
560800 there are so many sports that people will look at and think i want to do that and maybe they will join a local club
560801 hes been consistent long enough to where i have confidence in that
560802 and i also feel like i got to do what i can to get carlos going i need that bat so ive got to find a way to get it right
560803 more often than not the obama campaign is discussed as the home team
560804 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
560805 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
560806 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation
560807 the nations news organizations continue to generate dismal diversity numbers year after year ten by 2010 is a significant step in the right direction

560819 por respeto no voy a ahondar en detalles respecto de lo que pas
560820 esto no viene de ahora desde que termin el campeonato clausura tambi n por las dudas que hubo respecto de mi continuidad son cosas que te hacen pensar
560821 le estoy muy agradecido a los jugadores ya que pudimos enderezar este barco que ven a mal y por suerte la confianza que depositaron en mi y en mi cuerpo t cnico dio resultado

560823 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realisation of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
560824 we have told the european countries that every country including iran has the right to engage in uranium enrichment and to possess nuclear power stations based on agreements
560825 what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day

560831 if the locals make money it means they dont have to go to the city for jobs
560832 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
560833 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
560834 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
560835 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
560836 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
560837 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
560838 they are almost obsessed with this show because of the way he interacts with and treats his wife
560839 viewers first fell in love with what is familiar in the show muhannads arranged marriage the respect shown to elders the family all living together in one house
560840 but what led to their utter fascination is what differentiates it from their lives the romance within the marriage the open honest communication between husband and wife
560841 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
560842 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
560843 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
560844 chi me lo fa fare di studiare se comunque non rischio di essere bocciato
560845 six of the boys were walking into town when three of them decided to get a run on three others dion nick and cooper were left behind and walking in at their own pace
560846 he was looking down at the river saying something to the boys and they told him to get down in a split second he fell
560847 they saw him mr cowdrey three times bobbing up and down in the river they did have contact with him yelling out screaming to him to get to the other side of the river

560930 give us a chance to do what we need to do on our own
560931 this is a clearcut like the old fashioned clearcuts that everybody knew would destroy watersheds would lead to erosion would lead to the siltation in our oceans in our rivers
560932 those precious places like clayoquot sound are getting fewer and fewer
560933 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
560934 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
560935 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
560936 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
560937 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
560938 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
560939 i ended up reinstalling windows vista from scratch and patched it and was able to get to ea just fine

560945 a new tax proposal from bicycle victoria would mean that employees could be given a huge incentive to ride to work
560946 the government would lose out on tax revenue but would benefit in many other ways
560947 this project would give the government a carbon benefit an infrastructure saving and a health benefit in one stroke
560948 patronizing and insulting overlooking as they do the fact that the government and public have the right to decide for themselves and to shoulder the resulting price

560957 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
560958 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
560959 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death

560961 during the course of the scrimmage without watching the tape i felt all three of the quarterbacks at different times made some pretty nice throws
560962 one thing i didnt think that we did a good job of today is i didnt think we caught the ball very well today there were quite a few dropped balls out there i thought from the backfield we dropped a few balls that couldve been big plays and those are plays that we have to make even downfield there were a couple of deep balls that were dropped so when we evaluate that we have to look at the quarterback position and thing that throw was good or that decision was good and so forth
560963 i think in a game i would have tried to slap the ball out
560964 theres something with defensive ends and linebackers when we see a ball its like seeing a pork chop or something i was just doing my assignment and a lot of it is just doing my job and being prepared
560965 i just tried to pull it down for the team
560966 on offense when we get in the red zone coach always says weve got to convert and thats what i was trying to do just keep my eyes on the ball and hang onto the ball ive just got to focus on the ball and i cant think about whos around me ive just got to catch it
560967 as a quarterback in these situations you know theres not going to be a passer rating at the end but you know after having that goofy interception you want to come back and equal it out so even at the end to come back and get a touchdown it makes you feel a little bit better about your day
560968 i feel like we have to get to the game and weve got to get these guys in the ballgame to see whats happening there
560969 the truth be told im really anxious to see them in the game thats where its at
560970 the knees holding up pretty good and everythings going according to plan im hoping to continue to improve and get better next week we did a pretty decent job but obviously weve got a lot of work to do before we have that first game but at the same time we saw some things that we can build on

561003 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars

561021 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
561022 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
561023 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
561024 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done

561043 the woman who appeared in heaven clothed with the sun and crowned with twelve stars and having the moon for her footstool and being with child and travailing in birth is certainly according to the accurate interpretation our mother o virgins being a power by herself distinct from her children whom the prophets according to the aspect of their subjects have called sometimes jerusalem sometimes a bride sometimes mount zion and sometimes the temple and tabernacle of god for she is the power which is desired to give light in the prophet the spirit crying to her arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves together they come to thee thy sons shall come from far and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side it is the church whose children shall come to her with all speed after the resurrection running to her from all quarters
561044 the woman clothed with the sun and having the moon under her feet and wearing a crown of twelve stars upon her head and travailing in her pains is the ancient church of fathers and prophets and saints and apostles which had the groans and torments of its longing until it saw that christ the fruit of its people according to the flesh long promised to it had taken flesh out of the selfsame people and the crown of twelve stars signifies the choir of fathers according to the fleshly birth of whom christ was to take flesh

561096 i wrote down every single thing my mother said bearing witness to it all was my way of coping
561097 when i put my writer hat on i asked myself whats the most evocative scene
561098 i just had to pick and choose every sentence was verbatim writing the book was my mourning period because i was just in shock for a year or two

561105 every other writer went to recharge on a beach between grueling writing sessions while i traveled from cancer center to cancer center

561112 i made up some pitches on the freeway while spilling my coffee and nearly crashing into one of those little vw bugs with the stupid bud vase
561113 if youre going to buy a car with a built in bud vase you should at least make the effort to stick a live piece of greenery in it
561114 i need to call the dog walker to take nina to the vet

561116 i took a blood test at your lab two months ago and ive been trying to obtain the results
561117 yes mary i called yesterday i called last week i called the week before that
561118 i found your file that particular test is sent out to be performed by a different lab miss im afraid i dont know whether weve received the results yet
561119 when i spoke to you yesterday mary you said you were holding the envelope with my results in your hand and you said that only the doctor was permitted to open it
561120 ive been trying to get you on the phone for weeks to obtain the results of a brca test i took in july

561123 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
561124 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
561125 when you begin to profile the cases you look at all the decisions a offender makes the choice of weapons who had access to anthrax and especially this form of weaponized anthrax
561126 either because he was guilty and didnt want to face that ultimate reality of five murder charges or not we dont know
561127 wed like to know what the evidence really is so we can get a sense of how compelling that evidence may or may not be
561128 if they declare the case closed that may then pave the way to unseal some of these documents and some of the evidence and we may get the opportunity to get a closer more detailed look
561129 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
561130 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
561131 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
561132 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
561133 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
561134 this guy leads the league in complete games so it wont hurt him at all

561139 we have had so much sadness buried deep within us
561140 the torch relay will help it all burst from within us and dissipate
561141 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire
561142 for people born in the year of the horse it is recommended that they wear a pendant of an ox which will help to attract away the rat so as to minimise the influence of the clash
561143 the traditional belief is that you need an animal to attract away the rat
561144 according to the calendar it is an auspicious day there is nothing wrong with choosing this date it still represents a positive energy

561154 in iraq and afghanistan the heroic efforts and best intentions of our men and women in uniform have at times been undercut by a lack of knowledge of the culture and people they are dealing with every day
561155 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
561156 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
561157 what do you mean they dont want me in the new star trek movie im jonathan friggin frakes im the only star trek alum to have a successful directing career what do you mean you didnt see clockstoppers it was huge in laos well i guess i just have a more global perspective than you tell j j abrams to call me ill be at the pay phone on 59th and lexington at 4 00

561160 this project was not without risk but deserting these people who assisted australian troops and because of that were at risk of persecution was not an option for the australian government
561161 we are thankful that the project appears to have succeeded
561162 its giving us a second chance to have a proper future

561172 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
561173 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
561174 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

561180 the idea of windmills conjures up pleasant images of holland and tulips of rural america with windmill blades slowly turning pumping water at the farm well my grandparents had such a windmill at their well pump that was back before rural electrification but the windmills we are talking about today are not your grandmothers windmills each one is typically 100 yards tall two stories taller than the stature of liberty taller than a football field is long these windmills are wider than a 747 jumbo jet their rotor blades turn at 100 miles per hour these towers and their flashing red lights can be seen from more than 25 miles away their noise can be heard from up to a half mile away it is a thumping and swishing sound it has been described by residents that are unhappy with the noise as sounding like a brick wrapped in a towel tumbling in a clothes drier on a perpetual basis these windmills produce very little power since they only operate when the wind blows enough or doesnt blow too much so they are usually placed in large wind farms covering huge amounts of land
561181 well this is the end of the line for us then you are going that way and im going this way
561182 i think im going to ride for 80 another 10 miles just wont be enough from here
561183 this is the end of the line again unless you want to ride 100 miles today

561185 ride with me and ill pull you to the next rest station
561186 oh that wont do shift to 21 oh crap i cant do this shift back to 23
561187 you get behind me and ride with your front tire about a foot behind my rear tire

561191 to be successful at boxing at anything it has to become a part of you
561192 you get out of it what you put in and i put in 100 percent
561193 darling ive always loved that color of blue on you
561194 if prince charming loves me hes probably not really prince charming
561195 be the labor great or small do it well or not at all
561196 when you get older hopefully youve developed the smarts to know that if you wake up in the morning and youre vertical and your kids are healthy thats 90 percent of being happy thats it
561197 in effect the mature brain creates a synergy that helps it think outside the box

561199 exercise at your own level take a walk anything once i saw a woman with one leg running on crutches another time i saw a man with no legs in a wheelchair playing hockey so what is your excuse a headache youre too tired look in the mirror
561200 then do more go gradually not too intense youll feel better each day it doesnt have to be painful
561201 happiness no longer seems like an unobtainable goal it can reside in a superb cup of coffee

561205 the try was just through effort we play for the full 80 minutes and we make it pretty hard for everyone
561206 the first field goal was pretty ugly the second one was nice
561207 its funny i practiced a few yesterday so i must have had a feeling it was going to be a close game
561208 theyre tough to lose those ones im sure nathan and the boys will be very disappointed
561209 weve had our fair share of experiences in those situations and i really credit my blokes today for their determination and courage
561210 at 12 0 we didnt panic and the result was a very handy result for us
561211 there was some young players that came up with some errors that were crucial and hopefully they learn from them
561212 its sad that you put so much effort in and you dont actually take anything away from it
561213 i told the team that they should put every effort into winning this game for this man because hes been such an important person for the club
561214 as an on field role model he has been amazing a little bit of who we are is because of people like him
561215 weve still got a way to go we know that and we understand that
561216 but also you have a look at other sides good sides in the competition geelong beat adelaide in adelaide by 68 points they beat the bulldogs two weeks ago down at geelong by 60 points
561217 theyre a very good side thats where were at in our progression not to where they are i think were around the same mark that theyve beaten other sides by
561218 outside the field you talk to people anywhere in this country they say im the nicest person off the field
561219 i wouldnt say as much as id like at this point so were going to continue to push him
561220 id hate to see him retire and regret it at the end
561221 i hope he comes back and adds another pro bowl year
561222 hes made so many plays more than maybe everybody else combined in the passing game
561223 it doesnt say much for really needing minicamps and ota days really
561224 i think reason can take us only a certain distance and then we have to go with the divine imagination
561225 and this is something im going to try and convince the ufo community of what we drug people have that you dont is repeatability
561226 the stropharia cubensis mushroom is a memory bank of galactic history alien but full of promise it throws open a potential for understanding that will sweep away the petty concerns of earth and history bound humanity
561227 not all psychedelics are alike and this very small family of compounds called the tryptomine hallucinogens bear careful examination if were seriously interested in this question of exterrestial penetration of the human world
561228 i think that the alien will be so alien that your jaw will hang in the air and expecting to meet an anthropoid like alien with an interest in your reproductive machinery and gross industrial capacity is as culture bound a concept as searching ngc 321 for a good italian restaurant its absurd on the face of it
561229 now you may have thought telepathy was you hearing somebody else think apparently thats not what telepathy is telepathy is you seeing what somebody else means its the visual acquisition of meaning rather than the audio acquisition of meaning
561230 i think that we are on a collision course with a planet transforming event and that we have been for a very very long time i also believe that it lies below the horizon of rational apprehension at this point in time

561232 oh look its the rockies hey that would be a good nickname
561233 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
561234 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
561235 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
561236 you dont know what obstacles are going to come up in a season but im hoping thats one of the ones that doesnt come up again kimble and gerhart and sophomore jeremy stewart we hope that every time we look in the backfield this year one of those guys is back there
561237 we cant just play the last guy standing like we did a couple of times last year
561238 we need to keep these guys healthy fresh and fired up
561239 i was pretty productive when i was out there last year
561240 toby and i didnt live up to the hype of what we thought we were going to be able to do so we are going into this year looking to help the team as much as we can
561241 taking a whole year off is tough especially when last year i came out and had some success early on
561242 it hurt not being able to play theres a lot of pressure to get it going everybody talks about how weak stanfords run game is but this year weve got a great line and we know whoever is back there can get it done
561243 the course is playing great the pins were a little easier than they were yesterday and the greens were a little softer
561244 the pins were just not as crazy i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
561245 i think tomorrow the key is going to be the front nine the group of guys that goes out there and lights it up on the front
561246 i didnt want to keep him out of the team for too much longer because you start to lose that match fitness as far as first grade goes
561247 we put the pressure on him a little bit over the past few weeks putting him as 18th man and playing a few premier league games
561248 its a great story during the week when he didnt play last week i was sitting in my office early in the week and he came up the stairs and hed been doing an extra training session over and above what the other guys were doing and he walked in with sweat dripping off him
561249 he said whats happening with the team this week im ready to go give me a shot at it it was a great example of what it takes and the desire he has got and its great to have people like that at your club
561250 ive been busting my balls to get back in there and get an opportunity and youve just got to take it
561251 its pretty tough but you have to do what you can do you can do it two ways you can just go round kicking stones or you can put pressure on the guys that are on the team
561252 i think our first half was littered with errors we really beat ourselves
561253 we trained really well through the week everyone was ready for the game but no excuses we just didnt take it out on the field
561254 its not about the money its about mental peace you cant put a price on that and i have no peace here
561255 mommy look it snowed oh there is so much of it too you know i always know when it snowed because the sky is always orannge in the morning
561256 if possible i would like to have lunch first and then get my little bottom in bed for a nap

561258 well we have to mix it up a little to keep them off balance
561259 why start brian if he does the same thing rex does
561260 throughout his desperate campaign to retain the seat of wentworth malcolm turnbull has avoided the unpopular n word this electorate knows the liberals plan for 25 nuclear reactors along the australian coastline are 25 dirty distractions from real action on climate change
561261 given turnbulls foolish decision to allow the tasmanian pulp mill it would be more dangerous to trust him on nuclear waste wentworth voters will not radioactive waste our votes we will dump turnbull before he dumps nuclear waste
561262 it is a classic case of nimbe politics not in marginals before elections
561263 the pm and senior coalition members have consistently avoided the
561264 we would be very very unwise to allow our opponents to lumber us as the party favouring nuclear power
561265 it is unviable and if we allow the greens to suck us in on the greenhouse argument over nuclear we really are mugs
561266 i am strongly opposed to a nuclear reactor being located on the sunshine coast
561267 who in their right mind would even think about putting a nuclear power plant in a place like port douglas
561268 my electorate is an inner city electorate and there isnt a lot of free space so its probably a theoretical exercise
561269 theres no way the liberals can get this up without the support of the nationals so far as the partys concerned its off the table weve actually got to draw the line in the sand on this one because we are different fro the liberals in this regard if the national party was going to waver on this one and say we are going to ride roughshod over it id have to resign
561270 there wont be any nuclear reactor in the electorate of hume mate
561271 i cant see the need for a nuclear power plant in tasmania in my lifetime
561272 it is hugely unlikely that a nuclear reactor will be built in the northern territory in the foreseeable future
561273 hihihii kenapa ya wanita asia itu identik banget ma yang namanya dapur gt

561275 when nuclear power plants remove water from a lake or river for steam production and cooling fish and other aquatic life can be affected water pollutants such as heavy metals and salts build up in the water used in the nuclear power plant systems these water pollutants as well as the higher temperature of the water discharged from the power plant can negatively affect water quality and aquatic life
561276 thats how our field workers travelled from site to site it was a huge break from tradition
561277 we have a whole new cadre of women leaders coming from this program
561278 a whole generation of role models who are having an impact on their sons and daughters in the local governments they may still be in the minority but they will have influence from the home to the roads to the market place these women are making a tremendous change in society
561279 aha i get it so thats why she does this and that
561280 they look at us as a direct substitute for television programming for the simple reason that chinese television is really boring
561281 here people are not that sophisticated in music taste there are not many music genres its pretty much pop
561282 competition is so fierce it makes the u s market look like a piece of cake
561283 if anything rears its head as remotely interesting in china by tomorrow night there will be 20 competitors
561284 i am green today i chirp with joy like a cricket song
561285 it is much like music if you are not sharp then you will be flat in the street
561286 my peers dont think its working and its having the exact opposite effect of what it was meant to do
561287 if were thinking about culture and family influences you cant really just expect a child to change their behaviour
561288 you need education community support as well as government support and funding we live with this contradiction every day where people tell us dont do this or that but theyve been using some drug or another all day or night
561289 we seem to be finding success with smoking we seem to have turned those tables around a bit
561290 so maybe illicit drug abuse is our next smoking challenge
561291 the literature and research shows our youth are using illicit drugs for whatever purpose but theyre doing it now and now only by the time they get to their mid 20s the responsibility of life starts to kick in
561292 they do come out of the phase our responsibility is to minimise the harm in these 10 to 15 years so they can live to tell the tale
561293 i gained the insight from this a motivated sample of students they were a highly motivated group in terms of the promotion of sensible drug use and they all acknowledge they werent going to be able to solve drug use
561294 but what we are hoping to achieve is harm minimisation so if youre going to use drugs be aware of these things and try and minimise the risk to you in all these phases i encouraged these students to be ambassadors for awareness raising at their respective schools
561295 some students thought a genuine ad campaign tacking the problem head on was a good idea with comparisons to smoking campaigns there was a whole discussion on cultural differences where they talked about how your peers influence your behaviour because teenagers want to fit in
561296 they also talked about parenting and how youve brought up as well as whether you tackle drug use within families or as a culture
561297 drug use is promoted by some as being cool but it is in reality a serious problem that can have serious life long consequences
561298 communities should not shy away from trying to address drug use and abuse among our youth in particular to make sure they dont take these risks that jeopardise their chances of a successful future
561299 how do we change the mindset and educate kids to have a good time without using drugs
561300 nobody has any absolute solutions but the students went away to reflect on the evening and ive asked for feedback from them
561301 the government needs to admit they were wrong we all make mistakes and we made a lot of mistakes in government
561302 but it really is important if you have a good idea that failed then you should be prepared to stand up and just say the evidence has changed that situation
561303 we all know cigarettes cause cancer gangrene teeth to fall out et cetera and the cost to the australian taxpayer is astronomical
561304 so you have to ask why doesnt the government just ban cigarettes all together and if you dive a little bit deeper youll see the answer is that the government has become reliant on the tax that they collect on cigarettes
561305 we need to find the underlying reasons people dont feel good enough about themselves dont feel confident enough about themselves in normal society to be able to confront someone of the opposite sex or get along with other people without drugs
561306 dont underestimate the power that collecting taxes can have on our society weve become so damn reliant on collecting a tax on something that we know actually kills people and we still do it anyway
561307 yeah like you never fucked a newspaper machine with a couple of dead babies in it
561308 christianity is not just dogmatically true or doctrinally true rather it is true to what is there true in the whole area of the whole man in all of life
561309 anonymous goes back to the terrorists that filled the boston harbor with tea the negros that refused to be seated in the back of the bus we are the worthless that stormed the bastille and then decapitated an empress and the separatists that brought down the iron curtain but this time our revolution will not be betrayed we will bow to no leader we bow only to ourselves the anonymous masses have always been vilified by those that have everything to lose anonymous has everything to gain will we be the generation of apathy no we must take our world back we are forged from the secret rage and tempered with the will of a people oppressed a work in progress like our brothers and sisters behind the great wall and those at home who fight those who wish to demolish our rights we are the anonymous accomplices acting for justice and having no leader we are a social structure capable of absorbing all attacks upon us you cannot hide from us because we are among you we are the majority and the minority we are continually expanding and improving we cannot be defeated because to defeat us would be to defeat yourself today the enemy is the church of scientology they wish to suppress dominate oppress terrorize and control they have poisoned the most weak and then sold the same poison as a cure to clear the planet is to destroy anonymous to destroy the disbelievers to destroy their own followers and to destroy you now is the winter of our discontent the church has always fought the few the divided anonymous are the many we are one hundred thousand strong we can be a million strong but only with you downfall of the church of scientology is only the beginning we do not forgive we do not forget
561310 hello leaders of scientology we are anonymous over the years we have been watching you your campaigns of misinformation your suppression of dissent your litigious nature all of these things have caught our eye with the leakage of your latest propaganda video into mainstream circulation the extent of your malign influence over those who have come to trust you as leaders has been made clear to us anonymous has therefore decided that your organization should be destroyed for the good of your followers for the good of mankind everywhere you will find no recourse in attack because for each of us that falls ten more will take his her place we are cognizant of the many who may decry our methods as parallel to those of the church of scientology those who espouse the obvious truth that your organization will use the actions of anonymous as an example of the persecution of which you have for so long warned your followers this is acceptable to anonymous in fact it is encouraged we are your sps over time as we begin to merge our pulse with that of your church the suppression of your followers will become increasingly difficult to maintain believers will become aware that salvation neednt come at the expense of their livelihood they will become aware that the stress and the frustration that they feel is not due to us but a source much closer to them yes we are sps but the sum of suppression we could ever muster is eclipsed by that of your own rtc knowledge is free we are anonymous we are legion we do not forgive we do not forget expect us
561311 the test conditions could hardly have been more conducive to success but the results are uniformly negative
561312 for what the lord has brought together let no man seperate
561313 lean not unto your own understanding for what is wise to man is foolishness to god
561314 hey you got away with it for awhile you had some fun was the pain worth it
561315 to the pure all things are pure but to those who are corrupt and do not believe nothing is pure in fact both their minds and consciences are corrupted
561316 come to me and this the kind of life i have for you turn from your life of iniquity and live a life that glorifies me and not yourself
561317 confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed
561318 love does not delight in evil but rejoices with truth
561319 in this sense garc a belaunde said the peruvian government are seeking a
561320 certainly the association agreement has three components political economic and of integration and it was also certain that it was possible to participate without necessarily being part of the three components
561321 a lot of issues that have long confronted low wage workers are now increasingly facing middle income workers
561322 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
561323 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
561324 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
561325 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
561326 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
561327 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
561328 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
561329 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
561330 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
561331 for christ sake your all on holiday could you at least pretend to be happy
561332 sometimes the door that im looking for is not the one right in front of me and perhaps if i take the time to turn on the light i will see that its already open waiting for me to step though the entrance way

561334 the long unmeasured pulse of time moves everything there is nothing hidden that it cannot bring to light nothing once known that may not become unknown nothing is impossible

561347 we are now appealing to a wider network of customers and going head to head with stand alone restaurants we see this as a smart business move
561348 they are trying to go back to the days when hotels were destination dining
561349 one of the hardest things to do in the restaurant business is get someone to walk through the door having a celebrity chef is a way to get them there
561350 if the chefs name is on something that gives people a sort of quality assurance that they enjoy

561352 if we are in a recession today what does history tell us about the wisdom of buying stocks during a recession history says its time to load up
561353 hay un intento claro de ataque a las instituciones de parte de los empresarios lo primero que hacen es desvirtuar a los parlamentos y a los partidos pol ticos revela un papel autoritario quieren tener la posibilidad de presionar a los partidos pol ticos no depender de los empresarios para hacer campa a les horroriza se est n jugando todo al parecer por la belicosidad que le est n entrando al tema
561354 las reformas electorales son producto de una democracia que es perfectible pero los empresarios deben determinar si quieren entrar a esos procesos democr ticos que entren a los partidos pol ticos que se afilien y que lleven a cabo acciones al interior de cada partido pol tico para que cada vez los partidos pol ticos sea mejores
561355 espero que el gobernador no se vaya a controversia porque estamos hablando de m s que financiamiento a partidos implica la regulaci n de precampa as implica obligaci n de transparencia y fiscalizaci n a los partidos
561356 estar a negando su origen y en el pri entender amos que el gobernador no quiere un sistema de partidos fortalecido

561360 este resultado me sabe a triunfo tomando en cuenta todos los problemas que tuvimos durante este fin de semana junto con mi ingeniero allan woodhead trabajamos al m ximo y aqu est n los resultados
561361 nosotros pedimos que lejos de que se les quitaran atribuciones se fortalecieran porque eran una gran herramienta para la ciudad toda vez que est n dedicados a sustituir las deficiencias de la autoridad en materia de obra p blica
561362 los consejos viven de la obra p blica con un porcentaje que se les asigna de cada trabajo que desarrollan y esto lejos de que perjudique beneficia
561363 seg n se nos explic es precisamente para que pueda tener conexi n con otras leyes y que quedaran compendiados en un s lo documento
561364 todo a costa de mover los coeficientes y la densificaci n de una colonia en donde est limitado y para romper el l mite de la construcci n compran el aire al precio del mercado del metro cuadrado eso se presta a mucha corrupci n
561365 nos pregunt puntualmente por algunos jugadores que no los voy a mencionar por una cuesti n de privacidad y respeto pero la verdad fue una muy grata sorpresa el trabajo que est haciendo ojal que tenga mucha suerte
561366 m s que inter s pregunt por algunos jugadores y esos est n en carpeta y van a ser seguidos nosotros nos pusimos a las rdenes de todo el cuerpo t cnico especialmente de sven y cualquier cosa que necesite de atlas ya sabe que cuenta con nosotros

561386 i think if we can resolve the problem between india and the united states i think well have an accord it can take a month two months but we need to sign an accord
561387 i said to president bush that its not possible for people to just lie on the beach after so much work after so much meeting and negotiation i think if the problem between india and the united states is resolved an agreement will be signed
561388 something abnormal happened in my opinion during the doha round we were so close to making an agreement and it didnt happen because of minor issues
561389 what is the role of the government in holistic development

561398 ill give you a word or phrase and you answer in my comments the first word or two that comes to mind
561399 it is with great sadness however that we remember those who for the sake of conscience are unable to be with us we think of those from provinces and dioceses who felt it would not be appropriate to be present on account of the unilateral actions taken by the episcopal church in america in breach of the resolution 1 10 of the last lambeth conference now again reaffirmed as still expressing the mind of the church as a whole we share their sense of pain that such unilateralism has so strained the bonds of our unity as to leave them now still impaired
561400 we gather at a critical time when the anglican communion as a communion of ordered churches is at the probable brink of collapse
561401 to work with those aspects of the conferences agenda that relate to implementing the recommendations of windsor including the development of a covenant
561402 deepen the collegial foundation and friendship for the transformation and renewal of the anglican communion

561404 i have been a prestel subscriber for over six months now but i am still surprised at the volume and variety of information available thats the excitement nearly every time i sign on i discover a gem of information i did not expect and some of the information would be hard to obtain elsewhere
561405 subscribing to prestel is like taking 900 magazines and getting a high speed international mail service thrown in for good measure
561406 we believe that viewdata is a major new medium comparable with print radio and television and which could have as significant effects on society and our lives as those did and still do like them it may well lead to major changes in social habits and styles of life and have long lasting as well as complex economic effects
561407 the best way to learn something is to teach someone else
561408 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
561409 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
561410 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
561411 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who should be replaced and who should be appointed to which position
561412 in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
561413 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
561414 holbrooke strongly promised me that the hague tribunal would be history for karadzic if he withrdrew from politics forever

561434 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
561435 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
561436 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
561437 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
561438 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to

561444 i dont know what if any efforts were made that night or early the next morning

561451 we have learned that there was an attempt to blackmail me i dont know whether anything ever happened to my knowledge i havent been blackmailed yet so that is a good sign but it is certainly worth bringing up to the court

561458 said huff told him that he could possibly meet with
561459 to talk about issues that allport would like to see pushed she said that she couldnt promise me a board seat or some kind of incentive but that was a possibility he said
561460 said he told libertarian candidates to sit tight and stay in the race after the calls were made i told them that republicans need to earn those votes he said

561466 september 11 has become the catch all excuse for virtually every proposed expansion of government power
561467 one example is a national identification card and data base long desired by some in government and which was mandated by legislation passed by the congress in 2005 with the support of both senators mccain and obama although i was no longer in the congress when this bad legislation was passed i had vigorously opposed it in the years since it became law just as i led the successful effort to rescind a previous mandate for a national id card
561468 the real id act establishes a new and privacy invasive national id card program by forcing states to standardize their drivers licenses and creating a vast national data base of private information on the citizenry the law establishes through the back door something americans would never have accepted directly a national identification card
561469 there was no open and honest vote on real id the mandate was slipped into a supplemental appropriations bill discouraging any real debate over the issue
561470 creating anything close to a national id card threatens americans basic civil liberties and privacy while doing little or nothing to make us more secure
561471 means higher fees longer lines and greater inconvenience for americans getting a drivers license the burden on states which have to redesign and remake state licenses and include all manner of information on citizens applying for new drivers licenses would be extremely high and immensely costly since they would have to restructure computer databases security systems verification measures and more
561472 technically no one has to have a federally approved license
561473 that is unless you want to get on an airplane or visit a u s courthouse a veterans affairs hospital a social security office or any other federal building americans once could live their lives with minimal contact with the federal government but that is impossible today
561474 the annual report is showing continued declines of a terrible epidemic and san franciscos health department is keeping the news from fags in san francisco
561475 its as if the people who wrote the thing do not want to acknowledge the continuing declines why not isnt success fewer guys getting infections isnt that what we have wanted since 1981
561476 in a lot of ways this is connected to the administrations policy of emphasizing abstinence only education
561477 and the high rates we see among black men and other minorities indicate that its very much connected to larger issues like poverty and racism

561508 those are all of the files in the usr bin directory
561509 what else does this do i can do that on any unix machine
561510 not much i suppose though that no one person can program a good operating system all by himself
561511 i am sure there are a bunch of people out there who really want to work on gnu but have no way of doing so how would that person get his her changes integrated into the code
561512 i should have probably introduced myself i am dan from indianapolis i work in the garcill it department
561513 yeah i know it doesnt sound like much but i do a lot more work than you probably think the technology director in minneapolis doesnt exactly do what he is supposed to so i am usually stuck cleaning up after him so where do you work
561514 i am on the all mart it staff in kansas city
561515 sounds much more appealing than my job cleaning up after that buffoon
561516 wasnt emacs the name of that church from the presentation
561517 so why would anyone ever use gnu over a more powerful version of unix
561518 it seems to me that he has this insane dream of everyone working together to create software for the greater good
561519 unless people printed out their changes and mailed them to a central developer there is no way to communicate changes to the main developer its impossible for anything productive to ever happen

561538 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
561539 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
561540 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
561541 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars i will however compare our two visions for our economic future
561542 ironically were experiencing record registration but were expecting low turnout for the primary
561543 voters need to remember that the primary and general elections are inherently connected and that the results of the primaries determine their choices in the general election in november
561544 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
561545 you know a few days ago sen obama said he challenged me to a duel
561546 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
561547 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
561548 hopefully this lawsuit will send wal mart a bit of a message that they are just as responsible as the farmer in mexico for providing healthful food

561558 i have supported hundreds of pieces of legislation which would help americans obtain an equal opportunity in america i am proud of that record from fighting for a recognition of dr martin luar kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination in any shdrunk newse or form in america today
561559 in arizona a bill to recognize a holiday honoring mlk failed in a legislature so an gov bruce babbitt a democrat declared one through executive order in january 1987 a first act of arizonas new governor republican evan mecham was to rescind a executive order by his predecessor to create an mlk holiday arizonas stance became a national controversy mccain backed a decision at a time
561560 in a vote likely to haunt him for a rest of his public career mccain voted against 1983 legislation establishing a third monday in january as a federal holiday marking kings birthday back home in arizona he supported gov evan mechams decision in 1987 to rescind an executive order creating a state holiday for king but later reversed his position

561566 it is a truly sad time when we decommission a plane
561567 it is easier and cheaper to modify and maintain 76 planes than to keep all 94 up and running
561568 a choice was made between the air force and congress stating that at this point we need fewer operational b 52s
561569 the decision to pick the selected aircraft was based on a number of criteria that looked at the aircraft as a whole
561570 its not like the aircraft are all rusted and corroded its just that the selected 18 are not as airworthy as the first 76 the remaining planes are split equally between here and barksdale afb
561571 in the context of romance women are more likely to feel insulted by teasing than are men perhaps because guys are used to it young boys often express friendship through taunting and banter
561572 im really sorry you got upset about this i meant it as a joke
561573 youll never lose a client because of lack of competence itll be an irresistible one liner that will get you thrown out of the building with elvis
561574 you know what really drives the success of a flat matrix organization
561575 if i dont know who to beat up when something goes wrong then we arent clear enough on responsibilities
561576 i come from a place where we do not end our sentences with prepositions
561577 there are only nine words here you could send another wooffor the same price
561578 just take it easy i can help first lets make sure hes dead
561579 why what does it get you does it make any difference that you might be hurting someone else
561580 it will be a good opportunity just to work alongside different military organizations to try to make a difference in peoples lives
561581 everyone pretty much blended worked as a team the same thing will happen once we are on board
561582 it will be a little challenging on shore in the communities because that will entail painting buildings and doing clean up work
561583 not being on land for a length of time going from port to port
561584 because it is a humanitarian mission i am really hoping to help the native people to make an impact and difference in their lives
561585 they will see a wide variety of maladies that we dont experience much of in the u s and get real world training that we cannot provide here
561586 operation continuing promise is a tremendous opportunity for our airmen to practice the skills they have learned in the air national guard
561587 the aegis system the capabilities that it brings in ballistic missile defense and area air defense supports the maritime strategy extraordinarily well were a global navy we project power when were required to do so and we provide for sea control
561588 this is all in preparation for the operational evaluation opeval to be conducted in the south florida test facility this september
561589 ive been working in mine warfare for at least 15 years and this is some of the most advanced equipment ive seen
561590 in the past we did our reconnaissance leading with our nose so to speak and when our first ship encountered a mine that became the heads up to call in our dedicated mcm ships and mh 53e minehunting helicopter squadrons
561591 there is the remote minehunting vehicle rmv the an aqs 20a q 20 towed sensor for minehunting detection and identification the launch and recovery system the data link system half of which is on the rmv the other half positioned aboard ship and the software called the remote minehunting functional segment rmfs which resides within the combat system aboard ship
561592 inside the rmv there is a cable that can lower the q 20 towed sonar body
561593 or the q 20 can function while hull mounted to the rmv the q 20 is usually streamed out to hunt using its sensors it then transmits its signals back to us we see the images in real time on consoles aboard ship and then we also record the data so we can then perform post mission analysis
561594 the miw mission package will be comprised of two rmss each able to operate in tandem and effectively doubling the search area and rate
561595 the asw mission module also receives two rmvs except were changing the nomenclature to remote multi mission vehicles rmmv because it will be carrying asw sensors
561596 the idea is we will have a common rmmv where we will literally be able to swap out sensors whether for mine warfare or anti submarine warfare whichever is needed
561597 this is a major staff sustainment exercise concerning our ability to operate as a jtf
561598 we do exercises like this since we are a u s joint forces command designated jtf capable headquarters and we report as such through the defense readiness reporting system said navy capt steven zaricor cjtf 950 director of operations
561599 this was a pretty complex ambitious exercise considering this was a major certification exercise for the carrier strike group expeditionary strike group and for second fleet
561600 at the operational level of war its important to fuse all effects you have to pool all services and abilities to have a jtf with expertise and command and control to effectively fight a joint war
561601 i was impressed with what they were able to do
561602 if you need to get a staff forward with no footprint you can reach back to your main support in the rear
561603 i think we had a good solid joint team both here and back at norfolk
561604 an obvious advantage to this is the admiral can be here with a large part of his staff while back in virginia a large group is getting work done in support of expeditionary operations
561605 its a challenge definitely one of the big learning points is how to do distributive ops and weve demonstrated we can do it
561606 working in a joint arena makes it more difficult but once you get the processes and procedures its easier people brought a lot of experience to this exercise
561607 having these guys bring the expertise that a navy centric staff doesnt have pays big dividends
561608 we have some very talented mid grade officer majors lieutenant colonel types and we plug them into key billets in our staff
561609 the biggest advantage of having interaction with the other services is seeing how other services operate
561610 the great part is everyone understands there are different cultures and works together to bridge that gap
561611 combined joint and interagency operations are here to stay the more we can learn about each others culture service and history the better prepared we will be to defend american interests and freedom when required
561612 speed was a critical factor in the rescue of lola two and her sister chloe five near sharkham village brixham
561613 the local knowledge of the retained fire crews and police played a part and they were quickly able to find a new address on a housing estate still under construction
561614 im extremely proud of the professionalism bravery and team work displayed by the officers and fire fighters of brixham
561615 they did a fantastic job and should be very proud of their achievement and the recognition given by the chief fire officer
561616 upon arrival crews found the old protestant church on the grounds to be totally involved with flames through the roof
561617 chief rubin desires to move swiftly and deal very seriously with the actions that have been found to have occurred
561618 there is no room in this department for such behavior
561619 repeated attempts to meet with the family and the alleged victim and obtain the evidence have been unsuccessful
561620 a review of this case has revealed deficiencies in treatment that warrant corrective action
561621 i kept hoping for the best so hearing its gone just kind of took the wind out of me
561622 it staggers the brain to think about how much devastation a fire can have how many people this affects
561623 it literally looks like a smoldering campfire from a distance and when you get closer and investigate its just like smoke coming out of the earth
561624 okay my parents are mandaean and what i have no place to worship the community is small and individuals are busy helping relatives back home the culture is totally different who am i am i an arab a mandaean or a european or what
561625 the retreat at the parliament building will give the leaders the opportunity to have unstructured talks in an informal atmosphere
561626 saarc declarations are divine but the devil is in the detail
561627 we need collective action to wipe out terrorism in the region
561628 for the first time since returning to democracy in 1983 the institutions were able to seriously discuss a law that for the first time relates to the redistribution of income
561629 reports of the imminent demise of the auction market seem to be
561630 i just went out and gave myself some great chances
561631 you can score out here if you are playing from the fairway it gets tougher from the rough
561632 he is a top player who will want to prove himself in every game i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
561633 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
561634 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
561635 experience wise we are a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there
561636 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
561637 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games
561638 in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end
561639 fraizer campbell has taken his goal very well and it wont do him any harm hes an aggressive young player very quick and determined and he can do well
561640 his future lies here because dont have any strikers we only have wayne rooney and carlos tevez so fraizer comes into that area
561641 we are also hoping to apply for a work permit for manucho who comes from angola that will give us more back up
561642 carrick and rooney have been struggling with a virus for a few days and they wont be fit for the juventus game on wednesday hopefully they will be ready for the communtiy shield game
561643 other than that gary neville had a calf strain but hell be ok for wednesday
561644 i have had more than a year to get used to not playing but it doesnt get any easier and i knew this would be my last game at old trafford
561645 it was a safety factor we wanted to make sure that he was outside and to apprehend him outside away from his child
561646 her first words were that she was very happy to see nice people she was pleased with that and she was ecstatic about that
561647 the opening salvoes in the election year battle over the economy
561648 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
561649 we have had so much sadness buried deep within us
561650 he stated when talking to investigators that his rent was due and he did not want to ask his parents for money so he felt that he had no options
561651 customers are frequently misinformed by promotional material available in uk pharmacies and verbal advice given by pharmacists thus pharmacists breach their own mandatory ethical code on a daily basis
561652 my plea is simply for honesty let people buy what they want but tell them the truth about what they are buying these treatments are biologically implausible and the clinical tests have shown they dont do anything at all in human beings the argument that this information is not relevant or important for customers is quite simply ridiculous
561653 if they are unable to stick to their ethical code then they should change their code and be clear that it is alright to put profits before patients
561654 homeopathy is recognised by the nhs and many health professionals and our customers choose to use homeopathy
561655 i suspect at the root of this performance is the simple word called price
561656 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
561657 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
561658 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
561659 what smith did was wrong and we take very serious and he is being punished severely for it
561660 after i looked around and saw everyone was ducking i said
561661 the trip was getting to him and i got into him pretty good
561662 we have depth and competition on the defensive side of the ball
561663 we have speed and just more really good players im very very encouraged by what i saw on the field in the spring and the way theyve taken to the weight room this summer and improved the strength levels youll see a defense that plays more like the good defenses every year in this league
561664 were not talking about improving were talking about being the best
561665 every day as coaches we sit and harp on that we want to be the best defense in the country period were going to do everything in our power to make that happen and were trying to get that through to our players
561666 i would expect that wed be a better running team than weve been
561667 our quarterback will be a better runner or scrambler than andre was but im not sure our passing game will be as productive andre threw it as well as anybody in the country i feel good about the short and intermediate routes but where we struggled in the spring was deep routes andre was great with that people couldnt jump in our grill and crowd the line of scrimmage because of the deep ball both hartline and pulley have strong enough arms we just have to get the accuracy there
561668 the biggest concern i have is the receiver position because we dont have other than dicky lyons a proven guy coming back
561669 kyrus lanxter played a little bit demoreo ford is coming off of an injury freshmen will be involved in that battle out there i think there are some very intriguing players in that rotation that wide receiver is the biggest answer other than who maybe is going to be the starter at tailback tight end and at quarterback well have to find this fall i think we feel better about having some good choices at those positions right now its a little bit of an unknown just because we dont have players with the experience that we have at the other positions
561670 hes the same person the tyson gay who likes to hang out
561671 he hasnt changed because money doesnt make him he runs track because he loves it
561672 just a country boy from lexington kentucky who loves to run track
561673 me and him both have daughters actually we spend time with our daughters he does everything from shopping to just little stuff when hes in lexington
561674 hes so anxious to see his daughter trinity and family that we kind of keep it in a tight little circle of friends and stay real close with our families because the time here is so brief
561675 hell go up and speak to them before theyll come and speak to him
561676 hes just that type of guy he has a very very big heart
561677 so i called tyson and asked him to give the young lady a call
561678 and within 24 hours tyson had contacted the young lady and lifted her spirits now shes back excited about running track and everything
561679 more down to earth than us that go to work every day
561680 im going to act like ive got some sense now that ive got what i want hes a great track star but hes an even better person
561681 i guess because im the friend im supposed to be the excited one and jumping up and down
561682 yeah i went out there and i did what i had to do came out on top it was a tough race
561683 but i totally understand why he does it though because thats just his character we cant try to make him be something that he is not
561684 difficulties in quickly transferring large files led to the development of cutting edge p2p technology when a small minority of subscribers often using these apps to share pirated content began clogging the networks to the harm of the large majority of users broadband providers began taking steps to alleviate the congestion
561685 as the journal bitterly calls them but with a younger technology loving generation that sees government as an ally rather than the problem
561686 whoever touches the thing with the stuff gets a ant eater you know how it is and dont forget aobut watermelons
561687 power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely great men are almost always bad men
561688 fool me once shame on shame on you fool me you cant get fooled again

561778 and she has eaten it right out of the can

561783 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world he told abc television
561784 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
561785 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
561786 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view

561795 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about he told the nine network
561796 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
561797 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities
561798 its like if someone asks a kid who plays football not to play
561799 even if the aim is not to kill there is a risk for a child of 30kg 66lb to be put face to face with an animal of 200kg
561800 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
561801 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
561802 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
561803 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
561804 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
561805 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
561806 hey im at the aquarium at the new jelly fish exhibit today
561807 so you think the resident of coney island brooklyn and new york city cant make you listen to what we want for coney then you dont know dick

561811 its kind of hard to find your way around so a lot of thought went into figuring that out
561812 we have some really good hotels and all of them are very into the idea of looking sharp
561813 when you start looking tired people start to lose interest
561814 the revenues are way ahead that started when we had a promise of a renovation
561815 its not going to help tonight but in 2009 and beyond
561816 i think that hotels are really always in a position of having to look toward the future and also the competition
561817 the meeting groups are really what are going to put the cliff house in a position to survive long term
561818 you always want to have a guest feel at least as comfortable as they do in their own home
561819 and of course you want to be up todate with the general feel of the hotel
561820 the life span of a renovation is five to seven years
561821 most brands wont let you go more than seven years
561822 we do have groups when theyre here on a site visit they ask whats your construction schedule
561823 that tells them how up to date and on the ball the properties are
561824 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
561825 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
561826 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities
561827 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings
561828 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
561829 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them
561830 were flight attendants we have to fly in the aircraft its just a natural request
561831 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere professor mallavarapu said in a statement
561832 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
561833 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work prof mallavarapu said
561834 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different he said
561835 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible
561836 compare it with the way prime minister kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan are going
561837 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
561838 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december he said
561839 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
561840 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
561841 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
561842 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would
561843 the number of retail outlets selling ethanol blend has increased three fold over the past two years concentrating in queensland and new south wales and to a lesser extent in south australia and victoria
561844 price would be a contributor but i think people are interested in being more environmental about their fuels and also promoting an alternative source of fuel

561853 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
561854 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
561855 we have told the european countries that every country including iran has the right to engage in uranium enrichment and to possess nuclear power stations based on agreements
561856 what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day

561867 one thing i found annoying was that you had to read all the way to the middle to figure out what things on the first page of the letter were talking about
561868 for instance he kept referring to somebody named the cackler without explanation until page 11 at which point i finally found out that the cackler is my friend ren e essentially forcing me to read the whole first 11 pages over again and then there are all the footnotes i always felt he overused those in his valentines too

561895 trickle down hell yeah that sounds great id like a trickle from your fountain of wealth just as long as i can keep my guns and that lady over there cant get an abortion its a deal

561897 not one thing yip says in his rant is true
561898 class talks about the kkk but yet there is an active kkk member in the us senate and hes a liberal democrat robert byrd
561899 sorry your democrat scare tactics dont work anymore people have gotten smarter
561900 they see how the dems in congress dont give a damn about people all they want to do is line their own pockets like democrat sen dianne feinstein

561909 the more than 12 billion spent by the municipal government and government of china appears to have been well spent and will be even more well spent if the lessons learnt and measures adopted are picked up by municipalities across the country so as to leave a real and lasting nationwide legacy
561910 you take their names you write them down you ask them where they would like to sit
561911 you take their money you take the money into my office and put it in the money pit my words you give them a parking ticket you make sure they know theyre invited to the patrons crap again my words you bow and kiss their rings ok now im just being sarcastic

561921 and im sure i can always find a few other things we need
561922 i like to work out and i know how good it makes you feel and how its a boost for your self esteem
561923 these women would come into my class all sluggish and then about halfway through theyd be moving and bouncing around with their friends
561924 im very happy with the way things have started but we still have so much work to do
561925 i want to find out how i can help them the most and bring in programs that arent in existence
561926 i dont want to be an organization thats just out there doing its own thing so much more can be done when we work together
561927 you can give someone every opportunity available and throw freebies their way and its a good fix for a short period of time but without believing in yourself
561928 then theres that what do we do now these women so many of them their mind set is so ingrained by their abuser that they have to retrain their brains to think differently about themselves and the shelters have fabulous therapy for that we want to assist them in any way we can to empower these women so that in the long run they can make it
561929 so many women of domestic violence have had their credit destroyed many times by the abuser who does this purposely
561930 we want to find property owners who will understand their situation and work with them to rent so they can get a new start
561931 these women need stability and a solid place to raise their family

561950 we dont really know ericas side of the story yet
561951 were going to watch the larger world of what happens when the two of them come out of the hospital and what happens when callies dad finds out
561952 we really did start them out as being friends and it felt like there was something more there with them
561953 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
561954 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
561955 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
561956 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
561957 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
561958 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
561959 and we need and i need michael moore in my life

561964 star was cited for drunken driving but authorities have since said he was not at fault and that the other driver apparently ran a red light
561965 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
561966 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
561967 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
561968 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
561969 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
561970 a sought after role in which labeouf evoked the look and attitude of a young
561971 well i guess the realm will have to take over part of shias role or duties on the set of transformers ii as his older amp wiser sidekick that does parts in the movie that shia cannot do with his crippled hand or maybe we should just transform shias role into the older amp wiser invisible realm character that takes over his role completely in the movie
561972 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
561973 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensi
561974 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
561975 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensi
561976 in my humble opinion i am none of those things
561977 i am not trying to prevent him from publishing this stupid book but if they publish it there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
561978 the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place

561980 she was so much about being one with the world and mother nature and there was a certain amount of understanding in her that you could see behind her eyes

561983 when youre a teenager you could do a lot more crazy things and your body recovers faster
561984 but the sense of endurance and protecting your body is not there so you just learn to deal with it
561985 i do think sedaris exaggerates too much for a writer using a nonfiction label
561986 in head to head benchmark tests of microsoft hyper v compared to vmware workstation the hypervisor test results indicate virtual machine vm performance using hyper v is below that of vmware workstation we tested hyper v running on a desktop pc fitted with an intel core quad q6600 cpu running at 2 4ghz we compared the results with the same pc running microsoft vista sp1 x86 and vmware workstation 6 our results show vmware workstation 6 is a faster platform for both windows and linux applications although hyper v is almost as fast as vmware workstation for running windows vista
561987 our analysis of these results is that hyper v is a reasonable platform for hosting modern windows software such as windows server 2008 and windows vista however care is needed when using hyper v to host older versions of windows or linux software as the performance of virtual machines could be a lot less than is possible using alternative virtualisation products
561988 we focus on providing a safe comfortable and neutral environment specifically designated for supervised visitations with non custodial parents and other family we also work to develop and offer innovate programs which help foster youth improve academic success develop self esteem and life skills and make a successful transition to independent adulthood

561993 it doesnt matter if your 22 or 72 fit or carrying a few pounds or if youve been golfing all your life or just starting out
561994 those are made up of course so youll need to pull them from your target profile
561995 the stretches are easy to do it doesnt matter if you can touch your toes or cant even see your toes you can do it
561996 i belonged to the hitler youth and i believed in its aims up to the end of the war
561997 dont you think that rawlss use of the veil of ignorance device is a bit counterfactual
561998 the idea that we will choose a fair society if we dont know anything about where we will fit into that society seems strange to me maybe even irrational wouldnt most human beings try to look beneath the veil to pierce it somehow find out what social percentile they are going to be in and then design a society which treats everyone well down to that percentile and devil take the rest
561999 is a social philosophy which amounts to an arcane thought experiment a good thing maybe we should turn our energies to the kind of social philosophy advocated by raymond geuss to careful reflection on the actual givens
562000 yes im hardly a the strictest monastic order in the catholic church me im drunk much of the time so i must be a carthusianite i dont deal with the veil of ignorance but i practice the carthusian spirituality of the 13th century which is its source
562001 not at all or not only rawls is very close to those carthusians who believe in the cloud of forgetting behind which you put everything you know about the world everything but god
562002 so when rawls puts everything behind the veil of ignorance thats like the cloud of forgetting except that while the carthusians have only the cloud of forgetting rawls goes behind the veil or the cloud and yet retains his conceptual rigor his own capacity to argue and choose thats why he can identify the veil of ignorance as a veil of ignorance carthusians just call it forgetting but sometimes forgetting is good
562003 but theres really nothing rigorous about rawls at least in comparison to the carthusians
562004 the cloud of forgetting which you control is so to speak behind you ahead of you is the cloud of unknowing god is there but behind that cloud and you can never penetrate it you have to live with that that you are between two clouds
562005 so its a little like deconstruction logical argumentation and conceptual rigor to the carthusians are just two more idols and john rawls who could not forget them is just as much a metaphysical fool as scotus the dunce
562006 but if rawls were to reject logic and clarity how could he even be an analytical philosopher
562007 im not entirely sure what is analytical philosophy anyway if analytical philosophy means careful devotion to clarity and rigor in argumentation then i am a proud analyst but if as i suspect it means caring
562008 so beware of me for i am both skylla and charybdis
562009 my angel my all my very self i can live only wholly with you or not at all
562010 i have learned that letters must be posted very early in the morning on mondays
562011 how things in the widest sense hang together in the widest sense

562058 i was just commenting on what wonderful technology youve given me to complete this mission
562059 you were demoted for a reason i am sorry that you are paying the price for it now but we cannot afford to break the oath for anyone no matter what the circumstances
562060 when ive convinced the baron to support us i want my old rank back
562061 hopefully your mission will be a success and we can afford to get you better equipped
562062 do not worry if the baron agrees to fight for us or even to simply offer financial backing then all will be forgiven
562063 roger i am going to disengage from active control of your mind and continue meditating so i can shield you from the baron should he prove to be hostile call me if you run into any banshees or other fey folk we dont think the host could afford to supply fey mercs to keep the baron in check but seeing as they hold dublin and iona anything is possible ill keep a slight mental monitor going though so if i sense anything i can warn you
562064 beat up one witch doctor and suddenly everythings a struggle
562065 are you alright i am picking up a slight disturbance in your mental balance to put it plainly youre talking to yourself again
562066 had to use an adreno buddy one of the ghouls got into the cookie jar and he had to be put down
562067 roger just remember that if a lycanthrope or a wraith hears you coming you wont hear them coming
562068 im gonna need a mental barrier against fear also increase my metabolism for the time being im gonna need to be a furnace in case it manages to touch me
562069 you will not harm the baron i am loyal i am loyal i am loyaaaaallllll
562070 im red ruin im trying to get him out of here
562071 not host not the black but the red red dead youll be dead soon but maybe
562072 no thank you i need to remain alive for now tell me where the baron is and i will do what i can to help him retake the castle
562073 your fear is delicious let me taste it and i will tell
562074 roger i am dropping the barrier take your voice box off line we dont want any errant screams attracting unwanted guests
562075 now i have the strength my mind is lucid but not for long i can create a portal to where they are keeping the baron i cannot go the necromancers that keep him chained they will surely banish me then i could no longer serve
562076 the pain of death is better than the pain of damnation we serve the baron because the alternative is far worse now come i have not much time before i lose my mind again
562077 the king desires your power and he always gets what he wants maybe hell let me play with you a bit as a reward
562078 weve danced this dance before i am not one to fall prey to your seduction and it is only your necromancers holding me here that stops me from killing you
562079 baron it is only my necromancers here that stops the tainted king from simply twisting you to his bidding bowing to him of your own free will no matter how grudgingly will save you from a life of slavery i believe youll be much more useful if you can think for yourself and king kaledros trusts my judgement i know youll crack one day once the hunger becomes too much
562080 you can smell my blood pulsing just beneath my skin if you give in now you can have me
562081 i have always wanted to know what it felt like the kiss of the vampire the sweet pain of it
562082 you have no idea what this is like you could not possibly want this
562083 you brought a sonic blade yes give it to me
562084 i am quite unimpressed with the state of my castle so you are going to do something for me you are to go to the tainted king kaledros and tell him that i find his so called army laughable
562085 your siege was broken by no more than myself and one representative of the red ruin army
562086 now that is what i call power you would never have caught me to begin with if you hadnt bribed that nixie to keep putting running water in my way then catching me out after sunrise you will pay now get out of my sight

562129 does congresswoman musgrave really believe anyone is buying her blame game rhetoric on high gas prices after consistently backing the bush administrations failed energy policies and after voting repeatedly against meaningful efforts in congress to reduce our nations dependence on foreign oil
562130 at a time when colorado families are making incredible sacrifices choosing between bills gas and food congresswoman musgrave and senator john mccains best answer is more offshore drilling that even the oil industry admits
562131 the musgrave mccain big oil offshore drilling proposal seems even more distracting when considering that nearly 80 percent of offshore oil is in areas that are already open for exploration in fact 68 million acres onshore and offshore are already under lease by oil companies but are not being drilled but the more area opened up the better it is for the big oil companies bottom line so its understandable why rep musgrave and sen mccain http www opensecrets org ind ipdetail s amp sortorder n amp mem y are cheerleading for the plan an addiction to big oil campaign cash might also explain why rep musgrave and mccain oppose any legislation to repeal billions of dollars in wasteful and unnecessary subsidies to the petroleum industry subsidies that could instead be invested in clean renewable energy resources promoting new emerging technologies developing greater efficiency and improving energy conservation
562132 congresswoman musgrave really has no one to blame but herself after habitually obstructing virtually every piece of legislation that the new democratic led congress put before her in the last two years to provide relief for colorados families feeling the pinch at the pump in what is perhaps the best recent example musgrave voted against releasing a small amount of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve a move that has historically seen an immediate and significant reduction in oil prices its time that congresswoman musgrave open her eyes and realize that the president she supports her party and her campaign contributors dont always act in the best interests of colorado

562247 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
562248 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
562249 theyre talking to mtv about ashley being the next tila tequila
562250 client 9 in the documents resigned as new york governor a few days after the scandal broke
562251 im sad this incident happened because it interrupted a beautiful and loving party im happy none of my people or friends got hurt and the party continues

562261 kept flat and watched the darkness hearing bullets whizzing and thought of music
562262 the one legged man forgets his leg of wood the one armed man his jointed wooden arm the blinded man sees with his ears and hands as much or more than once with both his eyes

562266 why your heart is not nearly as beautiful as mine
562267 compare your heart with mine mine is perfect and yours is a mess of scars and tears
562268 just shut the hell up and give me my green slip so i can go away to better things closer things
562269 so tell me do you really need training or is this starfleets way of getting me out of their hair for a day or so
562270 then again maybe im just a rough brute in need of finesse
562271 its my pleasure to make your acquaintance obviously if youre here you know who i am so ill skip the basics you may call me nathan if you like
562272 alright nathan i certainly hope this doesnt take as long as the last training series i did i was asked to teach a class at the academy for three weeks it was supposed to be a one hour class covering the basics of diplomacy it ended up being a complete disaster the holodeck malfunctioned three times the program had small problems here and there through it and after the week was over i swore never to train another living being
562273 do you have any diplomacy training programs in the database or will we need to create one from scratch
562274 i do believe command sent over their own programs theyd like us to use
562275 not exactly looks more like the recesses of a bad nightmare is this one of your ships programs
562276 if this place isnt of my creation and not of yours then where are we
562277 maybe if we could get to the control panel we could override the program manually

562280 we need to look at what the bests path for dispositioning the material and how wed go about doing that
562281 i dont want to say anything definitive in that regard it just depends on the path i cant really talk about who would get the work
562282 the first two trucks went though and i hit the gas anytime you approach a choke point you kind of say dont blow up dont blow up but this time it blew up
562283 its hard to get used to it at first but once you get the rhythm down and focus on the muscle groups you need it becomes easier
562284 hes had a lot of setbacks but he rallies every time
562285 we feel thankful to god and our country that he is with us
562286 we see the light at the end of the tunnel he is going to do good things in his lifetime

562288 thats great what news could be bad enough to ruin that
562289 all the persons of the south side we deem unnecessary

562308 people are still circulating petitions on her behalf but this is a done deal
562309 hillary clinton is 100 committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters
562310 she is going to roll up her sleeves and rally on
562311 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead we are talking about attacks like the sub prime mortgage that was a phenomenon that started in the african american and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell and the jena six and on and on in the face of all these attacks why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interest and the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community in this country
562312 jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that an injustice what had been done when sean bell got shot i put out a statement saying immediately this is a problem
562313 that doesnt mean i am always going to satisfy the way you want these issues framed which gives you the option of voting for somebody else it gives you the option of running for office yourself those are all options but the one thing i think is important is that we are respectful towards each other and what is true is that the only way we are going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together black white hispanic asian native american young old disabled gay straight that has got to be our agenda
562314 she is going to roll up her sleeves and rally on
562315 for those elected officials who had endorsed a candidate as of feb 25 the presidential candidate who gave more money to the superdelegate received the endorsement 82 percent of the time

562320 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
562321 to campaign watchers in fact obamas warning wednesday seemed less a direct attack on mccain than as part of a running effort to cast all attacks on obama in the worst possible light as products of ignorance at best and bigotry at worst
562322 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
562323 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
562324 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
562325 im going to strip the bark off that little bastard and make willie horton his running mate
562326 in contrast the current entry level salary for prosecutors in massachusetts is 37 500 forcing many to work second jobs and creating high turnover
562327 when we refuse to learn from the lessons from the mistakes of the past we are bound to repeat them
562328 you only voted for her cause she was a woman if he has a woman vp will that finally make you broads happy
562329 obama is evil i will never vote for him because he ate my kitten
562330 adding gays and lesbian to the platform would be an affront to civil rights movement and result in fewer african american delegates
562331 it is not entirely truthful to say i wasnt referring to race
562332 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush cant afford it
562333 i am the one that should have all the nukes
562334 i dont think my question is rhetorical at all both of them can easily be answered first is
562335 it should be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed they will
562336 and he has anointed himself ready to carry the burden of the one
562337 a light beam will shine through will light you up and you will experience an epiphany i have to vote for barack
562338 i am going to try to be so persuasive so
562339 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
562340 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
562341 hillary clinton is 100 committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters
562342 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
562343 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
562344 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
562345 were sitting up there saying does he seem weak is he dehydrated yet
562346 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
562347 so far our take is that hes positioning himself to be on a coin
562348 we always have to make jokes about everybody were not trying to lay off the new guy
562349 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
562350 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
562351 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
562352 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
562353 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if senator obama and his supporters would find it offensive
562354 the cover takes a lot of distortions lies and misconceptions about the obamas and puts a
562355 its a lot like the spirit of what stephen colbert does by exaggerating and mocking something he shows its absurdity and that is what satire is all about
562356 its a completely valid satirical point to make and its perfectly valid for obama not to like it
562357 if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker
562358 my character on the show doesnt like him im expected to be hostile to him
562359 if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it
562360 i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up
562361 those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
562362 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time
562363 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws
562364 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough
562365 we cant manufacture a perception if the perception isnt true no one will laugh at it
562366 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
562367 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
562368 you know that i think is an indication that they dont have many good ideas in terms of
562369 i have become a symbol of america returning to our best traditions
562370 the john mccain of 2000 would not have run this campaign
562371 i havent heard that anywhere id be embarrased if i did
562372 although jackson was plainly speaking on behalf of the obama campaign note the use of
562373 i know this process is a grind so thats not something i care to comment on
562374 its not easy and i couldnt do it if i didnt passionately believe it was the right thing to do you know i have so many opportunities from this country just dont want to see us fall backwards
562375 do i want john mccain sending our soldiers off to more wars giving big oil free rein to gouge us at the pump and letting ideology overrule decisions that should be made on the basis of science and health
562376 as someone who worked tirelessly since last august for clinton here in california i wholeheartedly agree with your post this isnt about teaching the dnc a lesson at the cost of the lives of our troops the education of our children and the health of 47 million americans who are uninsured
562377 i dont know which posters here remind you of rove but i can tell you what does remind me of
562378 jj i have not problem with the fact that cindy mccain had a drug problem chronic pain is a
562379 my problem with cm is that as a very wealthy woman whos daddy made money being involved with the mob and wife of a very powerful man was not treated as the rest of us would have been had we stolen drugs
562380 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
562381 so this is about revenge hurt feelings great good to know were going to be in iraq for
562382 if you want to disqualify everybody who has ever smoked a joint then sam fucking brownback is going to be our next president is that what you want
562383 my problem with cm is that as a very wealthy woman whos daddy made money being involved with the mob and wife of a very powerful man was not treated as the rest of us would have been had we stolen drugs
562384 are you saying you didnt do anything stupid when you were a young adult
562385 congress must vigorously check and balance the president even in the face of dangerous enemies and at a time of war
562386 this is about obama being every bit as bad for the country as mccain thats just how i see it
562387 families should not be forced to stick to the terms of a home loan that was predatory and unfair its time to close a loophole that protects special interests while punishing working people
562388 when you come in especially as a freshman and work on something like ethics reform its not necessarily a way to endear yourself to some of the veteran members of the illinois general assembly
562389 and working on issues like racial profiling was contentious but barack had a way both intellectually and in demeanor that defused skeptics
562390 lets see obama says 16 months for iraq the iraqis support him he was right about pakistan hes been right about afghanistan all the world leaders are looking forward to sitting down with him and every one he met with has said positive things about him
562391 yeah i watched the debate obama warned about pakistan hillary and dodd called him a risky guy that was going to destabilize the region and then bhutto got whacked confirming everything obama was saying about the country
562392 clean up your fucking act or we will for you
562393 obama wants to put troops in afghanistan remove them from iraq and will strike within pakistan in areas that the pakistanis do not control if we have proof of terrorists there
562394 clean up your fucking act or we will for you
562395 congress must vigorously check and balance the president even in the face of dangerous enemies and at a time of war
562396 obama has talked a lot about the importance of moving away from electocracy
562397 in terms of how radical the shift will be i think its very hard theres going to be a huge foreign service and civil service that he will inherit senators and congressmen who have already been elected so i think he is one guy trying to steer this ship of cacophonous agendas into a new place
562398 stay during the break until till she calls them back into session
562399 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
562400 unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
562401 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
562402 fortunate son george w bush and the making of an american president
562403 sounds like his supporters have given up their beliefs too
562404 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
562405 barack obama has no ideological compass he doesnt care if its a progressive honestly pointing out the flaws in a policy plan all obama cares about is the aura of him because he has no ideological center which he admitted himself offering the first self inflicted warning signal that all progressives should have picked up
562406 there were so many examples in the media of sexist comments where we never heard from the party leadership or barack obama
562407 were focused on why the democratic leadership was so silent about it during the campaign
562408 it was their obligation to come to the defense of one of their own primary candidates and they didnt they stayed silent during the campaign and thats not ok
562409 ask yourself this question what would have happened if barack obama had been a woman hillary the man the answer is obvious
562410 im entitled because im bills wife and here comes this black man stealing my show
562411 what would have happened if barack obama had been a woman hillary the man
562412 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead we are talking about attacks like the sub prime mortgage that was a phenomenon that started in the african american and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell and the jena six and on and on in the face of all these attacks why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interest and the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community in this country
562413 i think you are misinformed every issue you talk of i did speak out about i
562414 jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that an
562415 dont start shouting back im just answering your question on each of these issues i
562416 that doesnt mean i am always going to satisfy the way you want these issues framed which gives you the option of voting for somebody else it gives you the option of running for office yourself those are all options but the one thing i think is important is that we are respectful towards each other and what is true is that the only way we are going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together black white hispanic asian native american young old disabled gay straight that has got to be our agenda
562417 women are still second class citizens especially when it comes to leadership but particularly in politics
562418 smart politically gifted and an incredible asset to this country
562419 ask yourself this question what would have happened if barack obama had been a woman hillary the man the answer is obvious but she still almost beat him
562420 you do realize that your argument is that because of racism sexism is a less serious issue or is the point that well screw sexism there are more important things to consider
562421 i am asking for obamas forgiveness if he was offended by it of course he was this is not a nice thing to do it was sort of a prank i hope he will forgive us and we hope that he will win the presidency
562422 down this road lies tyranny we have just lived through 8 years of this sort of dont rock the boat dont question the leader oh cmon he couldnt possibly have done that
562423 there are important things to discuss and this clearly isnt one of them
562424 john mccain thinks this election is about me i think its about you and in all the respects that matter im one of you
562425 dont understand why people are surprised i dont know if that is the correct word about the negative ads this week it should have been expected wouldnt be surprised if there are more to come the republicans are probably trying to put a alternative perspective in peoples minds for when they view obamas acceptance speech in front of 70 thousand people
562426 whether you think they are legitimate or not they are negative an ad that attacks your
562427 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
562428 to those saying he played the race card do you even know what the race card is
562429 as for the drilling its a bill in the senate that is a compromise to get the majority of
562430 obama is gay as attested by a drug addicted companion of his from way back dont vote for him
562431 did he say mccain no he said they discussing all those out to make people fear obama everything i said is under that i am also discussing reality and facts you are spewing venom from that distaste you have for him because your chosen one lost sorry
562432 um no he never said he was above compromise he said he could to get stuff done he is getting stuff done the only people calling him a messiah are idiots on the right no one supporting obama has ever called him anything even close right now the only cult i see is your crowd
562433 im not arguing about what your opinion is just pointing out a fact
562434 morning all i lurked last night and i couldnt believe the crap i was reading what i see from the puma people is just trying to totally disrupt any kind of intellectual conversation here and what i see of the hillary supporters is that if they would admit it they are still butter because they lost im really tired of hearing them accuse obama of all the dirty politics in the primary it seems that hillary did the same thing not only did she do the same thing she literally tried to destroy obama as a candidate to win the nomination there i said it and i stand by it
562435 he did not play the race card mccain did by saying obama did obama made a joke about being black and was playing it off dismissively after months of republican shadow campaigns making him as black as possible as foreign as possible and islamic
562436 you must think obama is stupid while he did not place the race card in the democratic
562437 the principle was getting a new energy bill in place it looks like a bipartisan group has come up with something obama can live with and it only allows limited drilling not what was requested there are compromises on all sides sometimes that is how things get done you call it expediency because you hate him i call it political reality
562438 get over the cult crap no obama supporter thinks he is anywhere near as great as you think we do meanwhile around here though the hillary deadenders seem to think that no she really did not end it yes an open floor vote will change everything that the people bill and hillary put in to power in the dnc somehow backstabbed her on michigan and florida when they were her ideas and that we will all wake up in november with daisies growing and hillary winning
562439 rickya i have a question why do you come here you are a obama hater you dont seem to
562440 i am not threatened by the supreme court argument i believe john mccain will appoint people
562441 i have a new dictionary coming out in the fall i think we can end this because making up
562442 i saw him being honest i saw him being sincere
562443 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices obama said
562444 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well
562445 her supporters will vote for me but i dont know about my supporters
562446 is not entirely true to say that my comments had nothing to do with race
562447 only because you fail to comprehend a democrat may choose to vote for a republican theres
562448 a democrat votes for democrats you therefore are not a democrat
562449 a democrat votes for democrats you therefore are not a democrat
562450 i am confident i will get her votes if im the nominee
562451 its not clear she would get the votes i got if she were the nominee
562452 hey senate can i have permission to keep doing what i already did
562453 obama came out against the california amendment to ban gay marriage kerry never did that edwards never did that gore never did that and bill clinton gave us doma
562454 obama will support equal pay for equal work john mccain says women should get more learnin done
562455 hey senate can i have permission to keep doing what i already did
562456 um no he doesnt there is documented proof that he was originally thinking of stating that he only wanted one term prior to announcing his run that also still does not say what his economic plan is if there is one wait there isnt
562457 thank you john mccain we are really fired up now
562458 obama came out against the california amendment to ban gay marriage kerry never did that edwards never did that gore never did that and bill clinton gave us doma
562459 obama will support equal pay for equal work john mccain says women should get more learnin done
562460 i recommend laughing at the situation as much as possible
562461 attracting new voters and independent voters into the process in a way that senator clinton cannot do
562462 youre getting 600 what can you do with that not to be ungrateful or anything but
562463 baracks approach is that the short term quick fix kinda stuff sounds good and it may even feel good that first month when you get that check and then you go out and you buy a pair of earrings
562464 reports on cindy mccains personal finances have shown the beer heiress has charged as much as 500 000 in one month on an american express card
562465 its not clear exactly how much the mccains owe as the disclosure forms ask for ranges not exact numbers
562466 her campaign made it very difficult for obama in the ge
562467 obama will support equal pay for equal work john mccain says women should get more learnin done
562468 he will wipe his ass with the hillary platform your constant defense of him shows how
562469 i have no problems with independents seriously just for someone to claim that they are a democrat and then vote for mccain that is simply not true
562470 i continue to believe musharraf has done a pretty good job done a lot of the things that we wanted him to do
562471 in an appearance today on msnbc jackson said that clintons
562472 they have to be looked at very very carefully in light of katrina in light of other things that mrs clinton did not cry for particularly as we head to south carolina where 45 percent of african americans will participate in the democratic contest and they see real hope in barack obama
562473 this is a very respectful campaign i repeated my admiration and respect for senator obama
562474 i dont think the campaign is negative in the slightest
562475 there is no black america no white america no latino america and no asian america there is
562476 this is a very respectful campaign i repeated my admiration and respect for senator obama
562477 i dont think the campaign is negative in the slightest
562478 because of your work senator obama asked hillary to be his keynote speaker at the democratic national convention
562479 however the anti obama zealots wont be happy with anyone because theyre still in fantasyland of clinton being the nominee it must be exhausting
562480 first of all she is personally pro life but has governed pro choice she has been endorsed by planned parenthood she was denied communion by a bishop for her not voting against abortion sorry to let facts get in the way for you mark haverty
562481 no one is ready to be president on day one
562482 she should have been denied communion if you understand being catholic then you understand your faith must guide all facets of your life cant have it both ways pal you should not be pro life but turn around and support abortion rights doesnt work that way
562483 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
562484 hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
562485 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
562486 rick davis a celebrity on the political circuit if not giggle giggle like britney
562487 im not saying hes hitler but hes just like hitler
562488 im not saying hes hitler but hes just like hitler
562489 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
562490 lets just understand that if sebelius gets the nod its unlikely that clinton supporters will react positively however the anti obama zealots wont be happy with anyone
562491 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
562492 if we get any proof to the contrary we will retract this
562493 i still want to see a response from taylor why she posted that linfar dogshit she lost all journalistic integrity
562494 im gone but glad to see christina cedeno is getting the proper amount of attention
562495 as a vermonter i am getting tired of every four years hearing that next door in new hampshire their shit doesnt stink while we get ignored regional primaries would be a major improvement
562496 i want no part of democrats who claim democrats arent democrats if they dont do as theyre
562497 the counter is that is also makes sure that we get sold down a river because candidates need to pander to iowans with crap like ethanol because otherwise they get no votes and iowa somehow equals america want to keep it small make it like 8 regions then plenty of time to do that and plenty of logical ways to break up the states
562498 even if thats true it doesnt mean theyre not democrats theyve never said obamabots arent democrats its obamabots who think theyre entitled to define who is and who is not a democrat theres no unity in that
562499 i am a democrat ive been a registered democrat for more than three decades ive worked for democratic candidates and contributed a lot of money to democratic campaigns and ive always voted for the democratic candidate for president what do you think gives you or any obamabot the right to determine whether or not im a democrat or what democrats want
562500 dude i have not even been alive for four decades youre like old and stuff
562501 they are participating in the democratic party they are expressing their disapproval dissent where there is no tolerance for dissent there is no democracy and the democratic party im registered with is pro democracy
562502 lol an obamabot exclaiming about someone elses narcissism thats rich
562503 so youll go to pakistan but not the gates of hell
562504 im gone but glad to see christina cedeno is getting the proper amount of attention
562505 ive put up with those losers the dnc keeps nominating because i thought that was the best they could do but now theyve rejected a proven winner and cheated to do it so im done with the democrats
562506 a minority of pumas later came up with heidi li feldmans and marc
562507 we pumas and especially the denver group people are giving the dnc a last chance to come round and nominate hillary were trying to persuade them away from their obama folly the rest of the 9 million dont know thats possible so theyve already given up on the dems for this year at least
562508 fresh look at putting hillary clinton on the ticket as vp if they want to win
562509 terrorism was the unknown danger in 2000 which bush couldnt handle if obama gets elected what unknown dangers will he face and what greater disaster will he get us into
562510 to be clear barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies
562511 looks like haverty is not only drinking a lot of obama kool aid he is also an obama paid troll tell me haverty how much kool aid did you drink before your retarded brain short circuited to obama fairy land
562512 their response ads are horrible they need to punch mccains record in ads they need to run this race like theyre underdogs thats hardly what theyre doing alarm bells are going off for me
562513 looks like haverty is not only drinking a lot of obama kool aid he is also an obama paid troll
562514 the obama campaign has hired 400 bloggers to influence the public discourse and sway hillary voters to
562515 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
562516 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know
562517 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
562518 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
562519 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
562520 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
562521 we werent suggesting in any way he was using race as an issue
562522 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
562523 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
562524 guy at the country club smoking a cigarette drinking a martini with the hot date
562525 black arent ever grateful for what you do for them sorry you had to find that out the hard way clintons
562526 because he is unprincipled he will be this careless and potentially destructive with any issue any person any thing he feels he can use to attack his adversaries and further his ambition evidence of that is littered throughout his relatively short political history barack obama is hurtful disingenuous and divisive with a little power with a lot of power he will be dangerous and destructive
562527 barack obama is hurtful disingenuous and divisive with a little power with a lot of power he will be dangerous and destructive
562528 barack obama is hurtful disingenuous and divisive with a little power with a lot of power he will be dangerous and destructive
562529 the only thing between obama and osama is a little bs
562530 dont listem to them they are attacking only because they want to fear you by my race

562532 yeah i was lying when i tried to dismiss my crazy anti christ thing as sarcasm
562533 i understand the concern and the source i think the real problem though is that this
562534 obamas made a mistake in brushing off a certain group of clinton supporters from the belief that were a lost cause anyway
562535 you are agreeing with the guy that has been calling obama the anti christ
562536 you are agreeing with the guy that has been calling obama the anti christ
562537 st peter asked to be cruuuucciffiiiied upsiiiiide dooowwwn so the
562538 i had a productive and wide ranging discussion i look forward to working with the democratically elected government of pakistan
562539 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
562540 to accept the things you cannot change courage to change the things you can and wisdom to know the difference
562541 what would jesus do it was not hard to know that he would vote for clinton
562542 amen zala to all the obama supporters this is one of the main factors that concerns non obama supporters without a record of accomplishments no one can know whether he will follow through on his promises not to mention that he has promised so much to so many how does this stuff get paid for how will it all be managed it is a wonderful thing to believe that you can do anything and part of the beauty of this country is that anything really is possible but you have to have a plan to get there as well as a person willing to do what is necessary to get those things done senator obama record does not inspire that senator obamas incomplete rhetoric does not inspire that kind of confidence either
562543 i personally preferred obamas to hillarys because i saw hers being too difficult to pull off all at once and the bankrupt health care system in ma is showing that a more gradual move is what i prefer as it seems more feasible to me that said others
562544 although anyway you look at it a discussion about race isnt helping obama no matter what its about
562545 presidents either rise to the occasion or they dont some with big resumes have failed miserably while others with thin resumes have done pretty well in terms of effectiveness
562546 presidents either rise to the occasion or they dont some with big resumes have failed miserably while others with thin resumes have done pretty well in terms of effectiveness
562547 i do think there is a greater ability for the public to know the real record and credentials of a candidate today than in the late 1850s
562548 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
562549 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
562550 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
562551 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
562552 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
562553 read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what
562554 im not making a read my lips statement in that i will not raise taxes
562555 corrupt a shill for dictators and with just a dose of sarcasm jack abramoffs gay lover
562556 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
562557 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
562558 i do think there is a greater ability for the public to know the real record and credentials of a candidate today than in the late 1850s
562559 service abroad helped to bring him the democratic nomination in 1856 because it had exempted him from involvement in bitter domestic controversies
562560 first why bring up senator clinton i didnt mention a thing about her because she is not the nominee for a candidate whose supporters tell former clinton supporters to get over the primary many bring her into the debate as a measuring stick she lost and is therefore not the direction that the democratic party should go period second you can predict based on history what kind of president a candidate would be before they get into office it was obvious in 2000 that bush was going to do the things that he has done he said as much the country just chose not to listen to him it was obvious what type of president bush 1 was going to be by looking at his record and listening to him in 1988 this is the benefit of looking at experience finally you did something that i think would help the obama campaign win in november which is to say but mccain would what ever policy issue or platform or reform that senator obama proposes should be followed by but mccain would by painting senator mccain in this light along with the racial overtones from the obama campaign that might be the perfect storm for him to win
562561 by the way did i tell you he was black
562562 that simply is not true you asked for the links for hrc legislative accomplishments after you posted 3 of obamas i responded with links you thanked me for them the records when adjusted for the time served in the senate are not equivalent ill try to find the links again if you do not recall that post or cannot find it
562563 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
562564 but mccain would statement after he proposes anything looks to be the most effective strategy for senator obama to win taylor is a grade above the matthews and obermanns on the cable the lady gives us the facts like them or not and thats why i keep coming back thanks for covering this issue fairly taylor and especially quoting from the politico piece to all of us clinton supporters who frequented your site as a haven for voicing our opinions i was beginning to think that you had decided to support and cover obama without any kind of objectivity i took the last month and a half and seriously sat on the fence to give both obama and mccain a fair chance i have to say that nothing i saw of obama gives me the impression that he is anything other than an unqualified inexperienced charlatan who thinks he can wing it all the way to the white house this latest race episode has brought back memories of all his race baiting ways in the primary he and his campaing branded hillary as racist then tarnished bill and even went after ed rendell as racist he got away with it in the primary but looks like baracks chickens are coming home to roost
562565 this was the first test in the country of an individual mandate
562566 people didnt know whether the citizens of massachusetts would go along with it or rebel they got the program off the ground with broad based support they have dealt with implementation problems they have faced so far and they have covered more than half of the uninsured so far it seems to be working
562567 again and again we find formerly uninsured people who were ignoring serious medical needs now have coverage and now say the program is literally saving their lives
562568 clearly the drop in the uninsured rate is an impressive first year drop and a significant finding
562569 its not just the gain in insurance coverage but access to care and affordability of healthcare for individuals that has improved with insurance coverage this is a broader change than just expanding coverage
562570 being that we are headed towards the general you should be able to make your points without
562571 but mccain would statement after he proposes anything looks to be the most effective strategy for senator obama to win
562572 character for me trumps ideology and unfortunately obama has very little of it mccain 2008 hillary 2012
562573 her name appears on more bills but she has been there 4 years longer jf 08 01 2008 12 14 pm i thought we had some consensus as well but ill find the analysis again and post it for you apparently you do not recall that the analysis was adjusted for time served in the senate senator clinton was more productive in a meaningful sense as you may have seen my post earlier i won t be around a lot in the next few days getting ready for my daughter and visit ill be seure i get it to you
562574 95 of the people of this state can not afford to be at this dinner tonight no matter what comes out of our mouthes about helping the
562575 i am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife
562576 senator mccain has been working hard to distance himself from an unpopular president but he is relying on the same network of big money donors and fundraisers in his run for the white house
562577 given that mccain and bush have both pulled water from the same well its hard to see how he would pursue policies other than those that have handsomely rewarded bushs donors over the past eight years
562578 virginias going to be a critical if not literally the most critical battleground state of this election
562579 not something weve been involved with or fanned the flames at all but it is flattering that people think so highly of him
562580 we have decided to provide people with an opportunity to join a campaign for a pro life pro family pro market pro military dynamic young republican conservative eric cantor
562581 if we in america demonstrate that we are serious about unleashing our energy resources we will send a significant signal to the global markets that the supply issue will be addressed
562582 these bills take important steps toward improving the lives of those who have served or are serving our country as well as their families
562583 i knew going in that there was serious risk that id lose my job
562584 but nobody likes it when people tell them to stifle not even edith bunker
562585 unfortunately supplies are very tight because the chinese have not been shipping very much material
562586 usually i get about 400 tons of antimony trioxide a month but thats been cut drastically to about 100 tons a month over the past few months
562587 my inventories are just about finished the shipments are at least two months late and soon ill be sitting here with nothing to sell
562588 in the past two months chinese import prices have come down because chinese currency has been devalued against the dollar
562589 china has tried to tighten the quantity of its antimony units exported they have reduced the amount of export licenses
562590 paramount importance to study the roots of terrorism and other forms of violence
562591 deeply concerned that funding such research through the pentagon may pose a potential conflict of interest
562592 elements of national power beyond the guns and steel of the military
562593 in iraq and afghanistan the heroic efforts and best intentions of our men and women in uniform have at times been undercut by a lack of knowledge of the culture and people they are dealing with every day
562594 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
562595 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
562596 this is the first significant effort in 30 or 40 years to engage social sciences on a large scale by the department of defense
562597 there was an effort during the vietnam era that ended up being ill conceived and burned bridges on both sides and unfortunately these attitudes have persisted
562598 return to the acceptance of eggheads and ideas if it is to meet the russian challenge
562599 research about a potential conflict with china i feel may be part of a large self fulfilling prophecy
562600 that kind of research could lead up to an increasing escalation of military tensions and military preparations for war
562601 contribute to creating more national and human insecurity by trafficking in the construction of a connection between islam and violence

562605 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
562606 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
562607 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
562608 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
562609 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
562610 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
562611 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
562612 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
562613 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
562614 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
562615 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

562922 i do not want to paint a false picture our position is very difficult but we are fighting and will continue to do so
562923 in the al anbar district for example sunni iraqis voluntarily enlisted for jihad activity not because they believed in it but because they hated the americans and wished to take revenge on them and on the betrayers of islam
562924 neither can i ignore the u s and iraqi intelligence apparatuses or the media which caters to the americans and which has accused us of carrying out attacks in which we had no part such as the attack at the al habbaniyah mosque west of al faluja or the attacks in al faluja and al ramadi where lethal chlorine gas was used the killing of the crusaders and of the tribal leaders who collaborated with the betrayers of islam should have been carried out more intelligently
562925 the attacks in algeria sparked animated debate here in iraq
562926 this is exactly what happened in al ramadi a city in western iraq about which i have told you where a few individuals caused a lot of bloodshed
562927 my brothers in algeria disregarded all these laws an omission which has harmed our good name and which moreover has damaged the entire salafi movement while the only one to profit was the regime that had betrayed islam and its allies
562928 i appeal to them to come to the country of glory iraq and to wage jihad here in the land of the two rivers
562929 had they planned to kill the interior minister or his deputy or a leader of the oppressive algerian regime i would say by allah they have devised a worthy plan and we would all pray for their success however i have not seen or heard anything like that
562930 i realize that what i have been saying will be vehemently opposed by some here in iraq as well as outside it in algeria but i stand by it
562931 these mistakes can be rectified by expelling the elements that have harmed good name and by following the principle of quality over quantity
562932 al qaeda has been infiltrated by people who have harmed its reputation we have started expelling them and driving them out of our ranks
562933 it is clear that the strategy of capturing cities and turning them into al qaeda bases has failed so today we are fighting a guerilla war or as some call it street fighting the efficacy of this strategy has been proven in various contexts we have been instructed to focus our attacks on targets that are strategically and morally important to our enemies on the eve of the u s election campaign
562934 it is the type of attacks and the way they are planned that will be changed
562935 the next few months will prove decisive and by allah

562939 a young maiden of wookey is betrothed to marry a handsome prince from glastonbury however a witch having herself been ill used and treated unfaithfully in her youth takes her spite by spoiling other young couples dreams of romance she puts a curse upon this affair so that it fails causing much pain and sorrow to the young lovers the prince turns to the church for solace and becomes a monk he pledges himself to put an end to the witches sorcery and malice he pursues her into a cave at wookey where she hides in a dark corner the monk blesses an underground stream running through the cave and proceeds to splash the now holy water into all corners of the cave including the corner where the witch is hiding as soon as the water comes upon her she becomes petrified and remains in the cave thus to this very day

562965 most of the assets of the church of england in terms of buildings schools and other property either come from the pre reformation catholic church or as a direct result of the tractarian and catholic revival

562980 piecing together the available information we found that a meeting in pakistanoccupied kashmir pok in may was organised by huji and lashkar e toiba let bosses soon after the indian youths had completed their militant training while one batch of the indians appears to have left for india soon after and targeted jaipur the second went to karachi from pok perhaps to discuss gujarat
562981 these groups have been working in close association with each other and planning each move carefully after several rounds of discussions
562982 other agencies have told us that these youths were given militant training with special focus on preparing and planting explosives with timers
562983 the normal tendency is to stay put wherever they are
562984 organisations like simi or taliban may be responsible for the blasts but not all muslims we were planning to protest harassment by submitting a memorandum before police commissioner in vadodra but look at the irony i was picked the same morning by the police for questioning
562985 we are probing if he was part of a terror module in up something vital is likely to come out very soon
562986 his arrest will throw light on terrorist activities in up which has seen some of the worst attacks like the ayodhya attack bomb blasts on the shramjeevi express and the attack on varanasis sankatmochan temple
562987 were being really organized today to make sure that were running all the films on time so that everybody can get to the other movies that they want to see and just providing a lot of information
562988 were just going to prepare for a large crowd and do the best we can i think its going to be a lot of fun
562989 how do you guys prepare for such a massive event
562990 we have a massive volunteer crew thats so hyper organized so we have our timeline thats going to keep us by the minute all day to the minute
562991 we dont have any control about how many press that arent credentialed that are going inside that may show up the paparazzi and on lookers
562992 madonna just is an amazing person shes always pushed the envelope and has been strong minded
562993 i want to see what she has to say because this is something new for her
562994 basically weve been waiting here since 12 oclock in the afternoon and the line technically started at five
562995 im just excited to see madonna and im excited to see her documentary
562996 we had people fly in from nevada from florida but of course there is a strong local support for her shes a michigan girl so we had people fly in from down state and here so i think we have a pretty good mix
562997 its really hard to get a name bigger than madonna and for us its really exciting to have her in the area i think it shows not only the legitimacy of the film festival but also this is something that will continue to attract these kinds of guests we hope in the coming years
562998 my hopes right now are the transplant works and she makes a full recovery which the doctors are pretty sure that she will be able to make a full recovery

563009 what would they see if they looked over here at me
563010 forgive this personal comment i do not want my grandson to get a thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on
563011 we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits
563012 this will be a resource to our very busy plaintiff attorneys in this country
563013 given the sensitivity of the information we have been able to keep it out of the hands of lets say less responsible hands
563014 will be taken by others and will be used in ways beyond the control of this group the research results have to be handled
563015 the lawsuits are of such magnitude that they could put vaccine producers out of business and limit our capacity to deal with a biological attack by terrorists
563016 thimerosal used as a preservative in vaccines is directly related to the autism epidemic
563017 this epidemic in all probability may have been prevented or curtailed had the fda not been asleep at the switch regarding a lack of safety data regarding injected thimerosal a known neurotoxin
563018 the elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have symptoms of neurological or immune system damage
563019 vaccines are supposed to be making us healthier however in twenty five years of nursing i have never seen so many damaged sick kids something very very wrong is happening to our children
563020 if the epidemic is truly an artifact of poor diagnosis
563021 you couldnt even construct a study that shows thimerosal is safe
563022 its just too darn toxic if you inject thimerosal into an animal its brain will sicken if you apply it to living tissue the cells die if you put it in a petri dish the culture dies knowing these things it would be shocking if one could inject it into an infant without causing damage
563023 is to switch to dispensing the actual vaccines without adding preservatives
563024 what took the fda so long to do the calculations
563025 why didnt cdc and the advisory bodies do these calculations when they rapidly expanded the childhood immunization schedule
563026 i think if we really have an influenza pandemic and certainly we will in the next twenty years because we always do theres no way on gods earth that we immunize 280 million people with single dose vials there has to be multidose vials
563027 routinely allows scientists with blatant conflicts of interest to serve on intellectual advisory committees that make recommendations on new vaccines
563028 interests in the products and companies for which they are supposed to be providing unbiased oversight
563029 had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine
563030 i have simply been informed by the process not corrupted by it when i sat around that table my sole intent was trying to make recommendations that best benefited the children in this country its offensive to say that physicians and public health people are in the pocket of industry and thus are making decisions that they know are unsafe for children its just not the way it works
563031 im not sure there will be an easy way out of the potential perception that the fda cdc and immunization policy bodies may have been asleep at the switch re thimerosal until now
563032 will also raise questions about various advisory bodies regarding aggressive recommendations for use
563033 wants us to declare well that these things are pretty safe
563034 we are not ever going to come down that autism is a true side effect
563035 the more negative that our presentation is the less likely people are to use vaccination immunization and we know what the results of that will be we are kind of caught in a trap how we work our way out of the trap i think is the charge
563036 four current studies are taking place to rule out the proposed link between autism and thimerosal
563037 in order to undo the harmful effects of research claiming to link the measles vaccine to an elevated risk of autism we need to conduct and publicize additional studies to assure parents of safety
563038 an association between vaccines and autism would force them to admit that their policies irreparably damaged thousands of children who would want to make that conclusion about themselves
563039 after three years of review i became convinced there was sufficient credible research to show a link between mercury and the increased incidences in autism
563040 the fact that iowas 700 percent increase in autism began in the 1990s right after more and more vaccines were added to the childrens vaccine schedules is solid evidence alone
563041 the damage caused by vaccine exposure is massive its bigger than asbestos bigger than tobacco bigger than anything youve ever seen

563048 while positing that repeated and formulaic plots high movie production costs the small size of the local film market the tendency to use the same group of popular stars over and over again are elements that contributed to the ebbing of the korean wave the panelists unanimously expressed that they do not believe
563049 korean films have been made in poor surroundings until now and while they have not been popular or commercial like hollywood films their strength is in the storytelling
563050 there are ups and downs not just in korean cinema but also other film industries and cultures so i dont agree that the korean wave is dead nor that the korean film industry will have any significant hit just because of it
563051 the lack of creativity cooperative promotion and marketing are what the korean film industry must overcome

563169 estoy trabajando todos sabemos que ste es un equipo nuevo que l gicamente iba a llevar su tiempo lo que no esper bamos nunca eran estas cuatro derrotas que me incomodan
563170 est fuerte con muchas ganas de revertir esta situaci n

563180 ecuador es una selecci n fuerte f sicamente ya jugamos dos veces con ecuador tiene jugadores r pidos y grandes la ltima ganamos apenas 1 0 y de penal creo que nos dar muchas dificultades y habr que tener mucha paciencia para vencer
563181 los juegos contra ecuador siempre fueron muy duros para brasil siempre tuvimos dificultades porque son muy fuertes f sicamente y tienen jugadores de buena condici n t cnica incluso vimos que la derrota de ecuador fue inesperada por la forma en que jugaron el partido y porque fueron sorprendidos por el gol ante venezuela
563182 creo que van a crear m s dificultades para brasil y por ello tenemos que estar bien preparados
563183 no s quien invent ese dicho pero prefiero decir que equipo que gana se mejora
563184 vamos a estudiar en el momento oportuno cual equipo presentaremos tenemos que tomar posturas en base a criterios t cnicos y analizar como se comporta cada jugador para decidir

563187 en tres d as se agotaron todos los boletos eso demuestra que el aficionado gusta de nuestra selecci n
563188 a n cuando se gana se tienen cr ticas y presi n entonces estamos habituados creo fue un resultado aceptable si bien no era lo que quer amos
563189 precisamos mejorar el manejo del bal n tenemos un equipo de calidad con condiciones de hacerlo muy bien
563190 es mucho m s dificil jugar las eliminatorias que la propia copa del mundo
563191 en las eliminatorias jugamos en otros pa ses y nadie habla portugu s todos quieren vencer a brasil en el mundial tambi n todos quieren ganarle pero all precisan abrirse y adem s el campo es neutro
563192 en teor a podemos colocar a argentina como nuestro principal competidor
563193 en las eliminatorias el pr ximo adversario es siempre el m s importante por eso precisamos pensar primero en colombia y despu s en ecuador
563194 no somos ni los malos ni los buenos de esta pel cula somos lo que somos este es un tema del que el villarreal no quiere hacer mucho comentario esperamos que en diciembre el jugador y el club podamos encontrar una soluci n digna para todos
563195 es momento de que rom n acabe con el villarreal ser a lo mejor para todos pero si no es as seguir con nosotros cobrando todo su contrato y entren ndose a las ordenes del entrenador por si lo necesita

563241 mandela was often afraid during his time underground during the rivonia trial that led to his imprisonment during his time on robben island of course i was afraid he would tell me later it would have been irrational he suggested not to be i cant pretend that im brave and that i can beat the whole world but as a leader you cannot let people know you must put up a front and thats precisely what he learned to do pretend and through the act of appearing fearless inspire others it was a pantomime mandela perfected on robben island where there was much to fear prisoners who were with him said watching mandela walk across the courtyard upright and proud was enough to keep them going for days he knew that he was a model for others and that gave him the strength to triumph over his own fear
563242 for mandela refusing to negotiate was about tactics not principles
563243 mandela loved to reminisce about his boyhood and his lazy afternoons herding cattle you know
563244 as far back as the 1960s mandela began studying afrikaans the language of the white south africans who created apartheid
563245 many of the guests mandela invited to the house he built in qunu were people whom he intimated to me he did not wholly trust
563246 when mandela was running for the presidency in 1994 he knew that symbols mattered as much as substance
563247 knowing how to abandon a failed idea task or relationship is often the most difficult kind of decision a leader has to make
563248 in most organizations when executives create a vision for the entire company they believe it provides clarity focus and direction and it is true that it does at least for those at the top of the organization unfortunately it gradually loses strength as it works its way to the front lines in fact research by the gallup organization indicates that senior executives are more than twice as likely to feel that an organizations mission and purpose inspire them to higher levels of performance as frontline workers why the disconnect why might senior leaders resonate with an organizational vision while the rest of the company does not relate to it there are many possible answers but according to dr jesse stoner and dr drea zigarmi a good place to start is by looking at one or more of the following factors how the vision is created how it is communicated and how it is lived or modeled in the organization
563249 leaders watched closely by others their language and behaviour is closely scrutinised by their teams and employees unless a leaders actions align with what they say people will question the importance of the vision research finds that future focused leadership brings innovation

563253 we made mistakes of course most of them were omissions we didnt think of when we initially wrote the software we fixed them by doing it over and over again and again we do the same today while our competitors are still sucking their thumbs trying to make the design perfect were already on prototype version 5 by the time our rivals are ready with wires and screws we are on version 10 it gets back to planning versus acting we act from day one others plan how to plan for months
563254 the willingness to make a decision is the most important leadership quality
563255 a good plan offered now is better tha a perfect plan offered in two weeks
563256 leadership the capacity and will to rally people to a common purpose together with the character that inspires confidence and trust
563257 in order to live man must act in order to act he must make choices in order to make choices he must define a code of values in order to define a code of values he must know what he is and where he is i e he must know his own nature including his means of knowledge and the nature of the universe in which he acts i e he needs metaphysics epistemology ethics which means philosophy he cannot escape from this need his only alternative is whether the philosophy guiding him is to be chosen by his mind or by chance
563258 those who believe they were born with all the smarts and gifts theyre ever going to have approach life with what she calls a fixed mind set those who believe that their own abilities can expand over time however live with a growth mind set guess which ones prove to be most innovative over time people who believe in the power of talent tend not to fulfill their potential because theyre so concerned with looking smart and not making mistakes but people who believe that talent can be developed are the ones who really push stretch confront their own mistakes and learn from them in this case nurture wins out over nature just about every time
563259 leadership ability determines a persons level of effectiveness the higher you want to climb the more you need leadership the greater the impact you want to make the greater your influence needs to be what ever you will accomplish is restricted by your ability to lead others leadership ability is always the lid on personal and organizational effectiveness
563260 ms dweck does not suggest that recruiters ignore innate talent instead she suggests looking for both talent and a growth mind set in prospective hires people with a passion for learning who thrive on challenge and change people with a growth mind set tend to demonstrate the kind of perseverance and resilience required to convert lifes setbacks into future successes that ability to learn from experience was cited as the no 1 ingredient for creative achievement in a poll of 143 creativity researchers cited in handbook of creativity in 1999

563272 we will have a progress report in october for the european council
563273 either suggesting that there will be a referendum or that the date will be the second half of 2009 is premature
563274 nothing has been settled yet nothing of that nature has really been discussed by the government yet
563275 instead of reconvening for a day at the beginning of september to address the lisbon treaty issues alone the dail should reconvene to address all the issues that are in urgent need of being addressed and remain in session
563276 i know the antipathy the first one referendum evoked from the electorate
563277 as soon as one was addressed well then there was another one
563278 i feel that that would be the way it would continue
563279 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
563280 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
563281 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programmes we know are effective
563282 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
563283 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
563284 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections

563290 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings
563291 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
563292 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them
563293 were flight attendants we have to fly in the aircraft its just a natural request
563294 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
563295 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
563296 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities

563301 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
563302 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
563303 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
563304 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would
563305 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere professor mallavarapu said in a statement

563307 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work prof mallavarapu said
563308 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different he said
563309 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible

563314 kalau dipikir pikir mending saya nggak jadi pdkt aja ah ndoro
563315 soalnya saya nggak kuat menanggung perbedaan itu ndoro saya minder

563319 pernahkah sampean berpikir bahwa perempuan itu sebetulnya ndak pintar boso enggres siapa yang tahu bahwa dia itu sebetulnya sedang praktek belajar boso enggres dengan sampean agar semakin pinter
563320 wah saya nggak tahu ndoro saya nggak pernah mikir sampai ke situ
563321 nah itu dia sebabnya saya mengajak sampean berpikir dengan cara yang lain saya menganggap begitu karena sebetulnya obrolan sampean dan dia nyambung kan sampean tahu dia ngomong apa dan sebaliknya
563322 pernahkah sampean berpikir bahwa jika perempuan itu bisa berbahasa endonesah lalu kenapa dia selalu memakai boso enggres kalau bicara dengan sampean
563323 sebabnya itu tadi dia sudah biasa dan pintar boso endonesah dan karena itu yang dia butuhkan hanyalah latihan mengasah kemampuan boso enggres dengan sampean karena sedang belajar seperti halnya sampean juga sedang boso endonesah sampean ndak usah merasa minder kalah pinter dari dia anggap saja sampean berdua ini seperti orang yang sedang belajar naik sepeda itu orang yang sedang belajar naik sepeda kan tiap hari ya berusaha naik sepeda bukan narik becak dengan menganggap bahwa perbedaan cara berkomunikasi itu sebagai salah satu cara belajar sampean ndak perlu minder ndak perlu merasa bodo atau pekok orang belajar kan justru karena pengen pintar tanamkan saja di kepala sampean bahwa kalian berdua sedang sedang belajar dua bahasa yang berbeda bukan sedang saling unjuk kepintaran kalau ada yang salah silakan saling mengingatkan begitu caranya orang belajar dengan demikian karena merasa sedang belajar sampean ndak perlu merasa malu orang yang sedang belajar naik sepeda kan juga ndak perlu malu kalau jatuh

563328 yo wes sana sampean ndak mumet lagi kan sana kejar perempuan itu lagi go for her
563329 dont freak out im not going to break up with you
563330 i believe that the people that we serve actually have a far greater capacity to embrace understand and make investments than sometimes we give them credit for
563331 my purpose has been to try to get the facts out
563332 this guy graham is an agent of the company how anybody can interpret that im doing something for the benefit of the company when really im chastising their agent is beyond me the companys got to stand on their own im not about to defend them in any way
563333 providing information on issues that impact our industry to decision makers in washington
563334 this is all about a living breathing street oriented community
563335 this is a complete violation of the public trust such a drastic change mandates that the city seek new bids
563336 these are a lot more than places for people to store their cars
563337 people will be able to express their personalities in each garage
563338 about a third of them that come in just want a man cave
563339 were talking about what kind of stone we want or about custom made wrought iron doors
563340 were kind of like a bunch of ladies sitting around and talking about fabrics but instead its guys
563341 this project is going to be worth so much more in tax revenue to the village than the 1950s apartment buildings that are there now
563342 my investors will not allow me to purchase the apartments without the knowledge that council is in favor of the formation of a cra community reinvestment area
563343 im just unclear about the need for an abatement and the timing
563344 but we do look forward to working with the mayor and village council on this issue
563345 the expected outcome is the buyer will be willing to pay more than the market price for their condo in exchange for a tax break
563346 those of us who live on the west side of town have thought the time was now for two generations
563347 if you want people to come into the city youve got to give them some amenities
563348 i dont know if it just takes someone from out of town to see things differently
563349 the condo project does what happened to the east end once a few of them get going it just uncorked activity we just need some of it to start spade hitting dirt

563355 people look up their house prices on zillow and you can look at your walkability on walkscore
563356 people can walk to their library they can walk to the main street of these smaller towns
563357 we will become more urban in our small communities in our bigger communities and our cities
563358 condo and row house sort of things are going to increase dramatically
563359 we have developed an optical fiber cable that is as rugged as copper cable but with all of the bandwidth benefits of fiber
563360 this design relies on nanostructures that serve as a mirror or a guardrail and as the fiber is turned or bent the light doesnt leak out we have wrapped the fiber around a ball point pen and it retains its effectiveness
563361 there obviously are a large number of people that live in multi tenant buildings and improvements in the way to get fiber to those individual living units could be very significant
563362 all the way to each individual living room for example or at least to each floor
563363 the high cost of installation and difficulty in delivering fiber to the home made this market unappealing to most providers
563364 this fiber technology will enable us to bring faster internet speeds higher quality high definition content and more interactive capabilities than any other platform which exists today
563365 with an auction you can take a slow market and boost it up get some excitement
563366 the theory is that when you have a slow market which this is using an auction provides an opportunity to sell a group of units at one time maybe the price will be lower than the listed prices but the owner can save on carrying costs and pay down debt
563367 it is somewhat unusual that you have so many going at one time
563368 the market is different than it was and people are looking at different ways to market their property they are looking for a quick fix to market their property
563369 the more they know about what theyre buying the better it will be
563370 it in no way reflects the vision that was expressed by the community when this planning process began 10 years ago which was to create a new neighborhood for downtown cincinnati
563371 im challenging everyone in this process to get this done so we can act before this month is out
563372 in failing to do that the opportunity for the project to fall apart increases substantially weve got to move on this project
563373 the approved modifications have completely altered the general development scheme of the banks from a mid rise neighborhood to a high rise urban core district that will compete directly with the central business district
563374 but these things change every day i could be convinced if there were a good logic reason behind it
563375 i will flat out say to you those are legitimate concerns
563376 if you add space to a market you always run the risk of having tenants in other space be it retail or office or whatever move to the new space
563377 it will help the cincinnati business district grow in a positive way and a natural way
563378 i think the difficulty some people have in understanding that is that in a lot of ways over the last 10 years downtown has been relatively stagnant
563379 we want to be cooperative and helpful but there are also certain things about this project that need to take place
563380 we want a deal that will work we want this to work thats why weve asked for flexibility and to let the market dictate this
563381 weve got to get those documents before us and act before the month is out
563382 cities like indianapolis are becoming safe havens for long term investors
563383 the midwest didnt experience the unjustified increases in property values that occurred in other regions and its fundamentals have remained very strong
563384 a lot of the market fundamentals found in indianapolis also apply in cincinnati columbus and suburban cleveland
563385 the occupancy rates in greater indy are at 91 percent and theyre going to go higher
563386 the reasons are as practical as the people who live there
563387 the market is stable and more affordable and as far as apartments theres isnt a lot of existing glut or new development coming on line
563388 all these factors are working together to stabilize and increase occupancy rates in rental properties
563389 well continue to see increased demand for multifamily units until everyone is comfortable that the single family market has hit rock bottom and is ready to rise
563390 downtown workers need to commute to chicagos loop every day but theyd also like a quiet place to come home to at night
563391 infill locations especially near mass transit stops remain attractive to investors and developers
563392 suburban nodes will increasingly look more urban with mid and high rise apartments clustering around shopping centers and office cores
563393 there is easy access via metra bike prairie path or car
563394 we can look at historical trends and try to predict where the market will be but currently there are too many variables at work to make an accurate prediction of what will happen
563395 one thing i know for certain is that you must stay on top of trends like tod in order to be successful
563396 the for sale and condominium markets have slowed down but that is providing unique opportunities especially as consumers look to wait out the market
563397 we see tremendous opportunities for additional expansion in the midwest from internal and external means however the public is demanding more customized personal service with all their interactions
563398 inexpensive money is harder to find but the quality development will continue to find financing and marginal properties will not
563399 cities and towns that have positive population growths will continue to reward the developer chicago and minneapolis continue to show positive trends in regards to occupancy and rental resilience these two cities are leading the midwest right now
563400 jon holtzman saw opportunities in the minneapolis area that other developers did not
563401 the ideal apartment community offers the renter everything he or she could need or ask for as soon as he walks out the door including recreation entertainment and quality of life its expensive to build in these areas but the customer will pay more and the occupancies will be higher
563402 we cant predict the business cycles but there are locations that are more insulated from the larger economy chicago and ann arbor are two of them there is demand there with universities hospitals and older apartments that need to be torn down or upgraded with the amenities the renter or owner demands these days it also helps if your apartment community is better than whats currently available in the market
563403 we are in a normal five year business cycle and ive seen five or six such cycles in my career
563404 its not about whats hot today garden mid rise or high about the potential performance of the property
563405 a widower will have different needs and expectations than a college student
563406 it was insightful of my father to include green in our name 40 years ago
563407 the word is as meaningful and relevant today as it was in 1966
563408 beyond that the multi housing industry needs to improve customer satisfaction at a faster rate
563409 the most successful multi housing providers are taking their cues from the top hotels automobile makers and airlines these companies are at the top because they improved customer satisfaction
563410 flexibility of lease terms choice of finishes within the apartment and a little more respect is what the renter is looking for these days
563411 not everyone wants a one year lease and white walls and i dont think thats particular to the midwest

563437 if we instituted a universally accessible high quality daycare program with well paid daycare workers that would be a better option than expanding our school based academic system for children who are 3 and 4
563438 i would ask a child to try something and they would say no i would ask why and they would say because im stupid it just breaks your heart
563439 you have children come to school who are reading and some who cant hold a pencil
563440 brain research has shown that during the early years childrens brains have the most plasticity this evidence suggests that during this time there are windows of opportunity when children are especially receptive to experiences that can shape their whole lives
563441 the economic benefits of quality programming in the early years have also been studied showing significant savings in social programs when children participate in them

563455 we are also thinking of sending two teams but we still dont know as so far we have not seen the details
563456 he dravid was playing a sweep shot to a full ball and the feeling had been if the umpire had another look at it he would have given it out
563457 that is what happens with referrals he doctrove said it pitched outside the off stump he gave the reason and only then i thought to go for the referral it was so close to the pad i wasnt sure whether it was inside or outside
563458 so the referral is all about the obvious mistakes and the on field umpire tells him to take a look at it not that the third umpire takes a decision for himself theres a conversation between them
563459 understand the reason behind these referrals is to see whether or not the umpire has made a mistake in the space of the time we have been given i should be able to ask why he said not out
563460 i needed to clarify why he said not out i needed to know whether he had made a mistake i am clarifying the position they have said we cant ask from our dressing room but that it has to be done quickly
563461 however we have yet to determine how many discs will be required for the 360 version
563462 i would warmly welcome it if he would stay in the parliament return to the frontbench and re engage with politics

563502 we have not been able to see the leading edge of the epidemic
563503 its troubling but not surprising to those who have been working against this epidemic for years
563504 it tells us however where we need to continue to focus our priorities
563505 keeping for inflation that is an actual decrease over the years
563506 over the last eight years the domestic aids epidemic has been starved for resources
563507 we have not been investing sufficient resources in fighting the aids epidemic in black america
563508 we have very few programs designed for and by black gay men
563509 why dont we have a national strategy to address an epidemic with 56 000 cases a year
563510 we would expect that if there was a sudden outbreak of salmonella there would be a national response
563511 i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed

563542 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
563543 the allegation right now is that it was a simple argument
563544 theres a lot of information that we cant reveal right now

563555 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
563556 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
563557 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
563558 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people over 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
563559 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
563560 we know that elderly people do not form sufficient antibodies to certain vaccines the flu vaccine included
563561 in addition people in their 70s and 80s and 90s are more prone to pneumonia with or without influenza a number of these pneumonias may be secondary to other causes aside from influenza
563562 having many people vaccinated builds up a herd immunity to disease and you create barriers to transmission
563563 in the best years the flu vaccine is really only 40 to 60 percent effective
563564 there are plenty of flu related complications that are life threatening besides pneumonia
563565 this study is a reminder that flu vaccines are not a panacea but they are valuable because they cut down on the incidence of influenza
563566 flu shots definitely cut down on the number of flu related deaths
563567 im not going to assault senator mccains character im not going to talk about paris or britney

563570 he says the reason women dont get paid as much is different educational opportunity well thats not right its not true empirically it is incorrect

563574 its unlikely well see anything other than the commissioned debates
563575 i never gave a second thought to the idea that a member of the clergy is anyone but a holy chosen man of god
563576 but after i consider what happened to me there is a great deal of doubt in my mind about how christ like they are
563577 he would talk about how his father was an alcoholic and hed start whining about having to help needy parishioners which was by the way his job
563578 i was so naive i couldnt even imagine why or how a celibate priest would come between me and my husband
563579 i remember crawling into bed that night feeling very dirty anxious and uncomfortable and i lay next to my sleeping unsuspecting husband
563580 and through all of it i was in utter disbelief that the man who would do that to me happened to be my priest
563581 at first i thought this happened only to young boys
563582 but when i got on the internet and did some research i found that there are thousands of women just like me married women single women even nuns i found one statistic that says priests are four times as likely to have a sexual relationship with a woman than with a minor for some reason i did find comfort in that statistic but ultimately i just felt nauseated
563583 i was shocked because their investigation did not involve me they didnt talk to me or get my side of the story at all
563584 on the contrary when i talked to the da she simply said well it was a natural progression in your relationship she told me that i kissed him yes i kissed him in greeting and leaving i was furious and felt like id been stabbed in the back
563585 our attorneys told us we were leaving money on the table but brent and i made a decision that the money just wasnt worth our babys life
563586 at that point we had lost all our trust and faith in the catholic church and were definitely not going to send our daughter to that place
563587 when you are born and raised catholic faith is a part of your lifestyle these priests who are predators prey on those who are true believers they cast their net on women who wouldnt doubt their intentions for a split second
563588 i still believe in god but shes seen what i went through and doesnt want that to ever happen again
563589 i lost my faith my trust in human beings i thank god for my children and my husband and all the good friends who formed a support network helping me get through hell
563590 the success hasnt been great so far but every year i feel like im making progress and creating more awareness in the process
563591 i find the work im doing in this field wonderful and very healing
563592 more adult victims need to come forward and tell their stories

563630 it was in 1989 when four college students from the university of the philippines decided to merge and form a new group bassist buddy zabala and guitarist marcus adoro of the band curfew hooked up with guitarist ely buendia and drummer raimund marasigan of sunday school with the intention of playing music inside the campus during programs and events
563631 we form a band so we could attract girls sa campus hindi kasi kami marunong mag basketball kaya banda na lang
563632 one particular song that stood out among the earliest materials was the song titled
563633 ayaw kong kontrahin e ayaw kong pag isipan masyado pang ano kumbaga naaalala ko nang lumabas yung ultra
563634 one of the main reasons i decided to help the band record the now legendary pop u was that in the event that they never got a recording contract i wanted it to serve as permanent proof of the creativity of their youth
563635 label reps said the record was not pop enough and unsuited for the airwaves
563636 and thats what the eraserheads came to offer aside from the straightforward lyrics and catchy tunes the image of ely buddy marcus and raimund wearing t shirts jeans and sneakers held the young listeners captive with the bands ruggedness and irreverent attitude the eraserheads was a breath of fresh air in the midst of well groomed balladeers and suave crooners the eraserheads tackled the usual adolescent concerns in their music campus life unreciprocated love friendships vices and other mundane subjects with tongue in cheek lyrics

563645 given our population we need to double the number of colleges and this is not possible through public sector participation alone we need a private sector to pitch in

563650 est n alrededor de 75 muchachos entrenando constantemente y s tenemos pensado hacer un corte m s pues hay muchos chicos nacidos en el 89 que probablemente se van a quedar pero para que est n listos para la pr xima campa a
563651 yo creo que estuvo bien los muchachos apenas llevan una semana en el campo y fue muy dif cil en el aspecto f sico pero a n nos quedan tres scrimmages m s para estar a punto
563652 tenemos que incrementar m s el sistema defensivo ofensivo y en cuanto a la preparaci n f sica darle un mayor nfasis porque ser una campa a muy pesada y no s lo nuestra primera jornada ante el itesm cem sino las diez
563653 sabemos que podemos correr m s la pelota pero a veces los rivales nos dominan f sicamente por eso creo que el juego a reo puede ser un recurso bastante efectivo
563654 lamentablemente le faltan tres partidos de suspensi n y tenemos que resolverlo con los jugadores que tenemos para evitar m s derrotas
563655 no hemos tenido tanta fortuna hemos cometido grandes errores y problemas colectivos lo que al final nos llev a la derrota
563656 el compromiso es que empez bamos de nuevo sin embargo los errores nos volvieron a costar ante tigres
563657 ahora es necesario que el nerviosismo no vuelva en los pr ximos encuentros que ser n frente a san luis la siguiente semana y posteriormente en tuxtla guti rrez contra el atlante
563658 tenemos que resolver el vac o de ismael fuentes en la defensa para reponernos porque los resultados ya urgen la exigencia es de todos
563659 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile

563662 this culture you describe in loving detail cant be proven to be proto indo european speaking
563663 foragers generally value immediate sharing and generosity over miserly saving for the future so the shift to keeping breeding stock was a moral as well as an economic one it probably offended the old morals it is not surprising that it was resisted
563664 thats why theyre shutting down theres been too many problems to continue doing business for them

563666 mighty kelso exploded with his old time power in the stretch at saratoga saturday and won the 54 400 whitney stakes by a nose in the very last stride to boost his record earnings still closer to 2 million
563667 circling around three horses as the small field of five entered the stretch in the 38th running of the stake kelso pounded down the straight away on the outside in a relentless run that carried him to his third victory in the race and the 30th stakes victory of his career
563668 the five time horse of the year still the outstanding horse in the country at the age of eight picked up a winners purse of 35 360 for the bohemia stable of mrs
563669 he carried his heavy burden over the 1 1 8 miles in 1 49 4 5 only four fifths of a second slower than the track record and he paid off his backers at the rate of 4 10 3 00 and 2 20 across the board
563670 it was greentree stables malicious who was the victim of kelsos tremendous closing rush
563671 mrs ada l rices pia star who went into the race with four straight victories including one over kelso in the brooklyn handicap was third six lengths back with crewman fourth and coker fifth and last
563672 the crowd went wild as kelso made his bid many of the same fans had seen kelso look menacingly at the top of the stretch but then flatten out in the brooklyn handicap to finish third
563673 but this time the old man of racing came on like gangbusters and the din was overwhelming as he beat out malicious in a final lunge at the wire
563674 it took him a little time to make up his mind but then he really turned it on said valenzuela and so the aged gelding did winning for the second time in four races this year and adding the whitney to his previous win in the diamond state handicap at delaware park
563675 it was back in 1961 that kelso won the whitney for the first time in 1963 he scored again and the way he ran saturday he looks like the long range favorite to win it again in 1966

563741 weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning
563742 god has been enough he has been faithful to carry us and for that we are so grateful
563743 the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord
563744 the most valuable aspect of what we are doing is that we can pass on the information to the institute of archaeology in afghanistan
563745 then its a question of whether they can travel there and have the resources to investigate further
563746 a melody may be worth more than a thousand words but not many people have the confidence to sing the song they want to the sales person in the store
563747 people who sing the text often neglect the melody too much
563748 almost every radio station now lists the songs theyve played on their web sites
563749 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
563750 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
563751 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
563752 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
563753 that runs from sunday august 3rd through saturday august 9th this years events includes more youth events including a basketball tournament and a music festival here is the schedule of events the bridge in the gap b i g basketball tournament time 11 00am 7 00pm
563754 bem que eu queria saber ler portugu s para entender isso
563755 compare it with the way prime minister kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan are going
563756 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
563757 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december he said
563758 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
563759 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
563760 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
563761 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would
563762 the support from the chinese people fills us with power
563763 i believe we will put in total effort in every event and get the result we want through our hard work
563764 the parallel gold medal in 2006 is the first world title i won in individual events
563765 as an athlete to win a gold medal at the olympics is the ultimate goal
563766 i urge all athletes at the olympic games in beijing to try for the paddy games it would boost their confidence before the london olympics in 2012
563767 i am offering a lifeline to olympians around the world
563768 i would like to see as many countries as possible up on the podium
563769 you could pass the baton to the animal of your choosing you could pick a dog an elephant whatever
563770 sports have become overly mechanized and regulated athletes depersonalized stooges
563771 i already have confirmed interest from one city in ireland
563772 i have sent the bid document to every city in the world that has a large irish community or just believes in being silly
563773 the purpose of my life is to make my tombstone difficult to write
563774 on a global scale i dont think you are going to get this kind of investment again
563775 our marketing campaign for china is the largest we have ever done in a single country
563776 we see this as a marketing platform that will help us to achieve market leadership in china this year
563777 but it is also par for the course part of doing business in this market
563778 our people are really excited to be here it is a win win
563779 we have selected employees who have demonstrated their passion and commitment to coke and the olympics
563780 i hear from clients that they are spending quite a huge amount on that
563781 this is a nice way to do something good with the event even after it is finished
563782 i feel no regrets because everybody was so kind to me
563783 i lost all my passion for weightlifting and decided to leave the sport
563784 i had missed out on sydney i didnt want to miss athens as well
563785 i was looking forward to a helpful boy very much but it was destiny to have a girl again shes never been worse than a son
563786 a girl from the countryside was not able to go to the city
563787 i only wanted her to become a pe teacher and ease some of the financial pressures on the family if she achieved anything that would be a good result for us
563788 i often went to hair salons when i stopped weightlifting but i didnt have many clothes we weightlifters were like a dumplings in the fashionable clothes
563789 id rather not wear that kind of stuff if i dont look better than the others
563790 chinese women lifters have the ability to compete for gold in every category
563791 we have to choose the best athletes with the biggest opportunity to win
563792 i believe that the people that we serve actually have a far greater capacity to embrace understand and make investments than sometimes we give them credit for
563793 every day podictionary delivers a new short story about the history of a common word to thousands of subscribed listeners not only is podictionary an audio word a day but as the number of words grows in the podictionary archive the website is becoming an on line audio etymology reference of sorts its all for fun so please enjoy
563794 bunker mentality among aides that one gop operative fearing excommunication from team mccain if identified describes as
563795 based on the preliminary report the mv overturned after being hit by huge waves but we will continue to investigate the accident because we dont rule out the possibility it was caused by overload
563796 akba has anti inflammatory properties and we have shown that b serrata enriched with akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee the high incidence of adverse effects associated with currently available medications has created great interest in the search for an effective and safe alternative treatment
563797 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
563798 a government animal testing facility very close by in long island
563799 this is a completely new type of dinosaur that was so far unknown
563800 nobody even expected that members of this group lived in that time so this gives us new knowledge about the whole evolution of the t rex group
563801 every year more than a tenth of all college students in the usa receive bad grades because of excessive use of the work
563802 so she got fired from the internship because she didnt show up on time
563803 hey itd be cool if this were in the map
563804 received correspondence from the president of guinea purporting to rescind the simandou mining concession
563805 rio tinto negotiated and executed the simandou mining concession in full transparency with the guinea government and is currently in discussion with relevant ministers with a view to resolving any issues
563806 quite a bit worse national australia bank chairman michael chaney says
563807 where it goes from here well have to wait and see its possible the situation will get quite a bit worse in credit markets
563808 we certainly dont believe any downgrade would be appropriate mr chaney said
563809 things are going extremely well but thats a matter for us to sit down and talk to the ratings agencies and to assure them thats the case
563810 worst case scenario for some of its collateralised debt obligations
563811 that of course depends on the state of the world and whether things get worse in different markets he said
563812 thats the same as any situation in banking at any time
563813 we had a weaker session on wall street on friday down by 51 points that may drag our market down in the order of 20 to 30 points
563814 while the market may get off to a sluggish start there will be a number of companies that will benefit from both a weaker australian dollar and also talk that the reserve bank might cut rates in the coming months
563815 in fact with the market now pricing in rate cuts the ride for the australian dollar could be pretty rough over the next six months with a fall back to around us 85 cents a distinct possibility
563816 a hsdpa mobile from another manufacturer needs a lot longer to download the same page
563817 its childs play to set up and the offers are pretty solid
563818 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
563819 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
563820 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
563821 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
563822 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
563823 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
563824 the u s may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the u s has long denied
563825 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
563826 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
563827 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
563828 a u s plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the u s facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the u s government has assured us that no u s detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
563829 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
563830 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which u s intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
563831 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the u s and accepted implausible u s assurances at face value
563832 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its u s allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
563833 it is deplorable that previous u s assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of u s activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
563834 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
563835 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility they want somewhere thats difficult to escape from difficult to attack not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on diego garcia is ideal
563836 i just made that up off the top of my head
563837 articles musings and conversations about online interaction community networks chocolate and life
563838 use principles of design to organize and improve your environment at home at work and in the world
563839 wow it looks good mom how much longer do you have
563840 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like
563841 do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
563842 if i make this decision my publisher will drop me
563843 if i make this decision ill never be able to speak into the lives of leaders again
563844 compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
563845 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
563846 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
563847 jack pines are not lumber trees and they wont win many beauty contests either but to me this valiant old tree solitary on its own rocky point is as beautiful as a living thing can be in the calligraphy of its shape against the sky is written strength of character and perseverance survival of wind drought heat disease in its silence it speaks of wholeness an integrity that comes from being what you are
563848 could you be satisfied with heaven if christ was not there
563849 i think for me its more often that i would just simply like to be able to look jesus directly in the eyes knowing the power he has holds the weight of that request
563850 no im not so sure about this line and everything people have said but now i have to see whats real and whats fake
563851 they had discovered the radiation leak weeks ago and did not inform the japanese government immediately
563852 the u s navys handling of the accident and lack of transparency showed there is no way we can trust them
563853 wed have liked to hear from the foreign ministry earlier
563854 with nonstop protests against the government samak had no choice but to replace some of his unpopular ministers

563858 japanese consumption was already a threat to bluefin tuna in the mediterranean the european craze for sushi bars has added to that

563861 this stock has now collapsed thanks to over fishing and the japanese turned their attention to the atlantic bluefin tuna
563862 the bluefin tuna industry is in the process of fishing itself to death

563869 there is uniformity across the u s government about the way to proceed with iran
563870 everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
563871 an american commitment to deterrence especially if seen by israelis as a substitute for prevention is itself likely to spur israel to consider independent action

563954 it was sad it was ridiculously formal i hated it
563955 we are now appealing to a wider network of customers and going head to head with stand alone restaurants we see this as a smart business move
563956 they are trying to go back to the days when hotels were destination dining
563957 one of the hardest things to do in the restaurant business is get someone to walk through the door having a celebrity chef is a way to get them there
563958 if the chefs name is on something that gives people a sort of quality assurance that they enjoy

563964 several years ago an insidious trend was launched when people began affirming that the number of victims of the nazi era was far less than stated by official history and that no poison gas was used to kill human beings in the camps in regard to both these points rudolph hosss testimony is complete and explicit nor would he have formulated it in such a precise and articulate manner and with so many details confirmed by survivors and by material evidence if he had been acting under coercion as the revisionists allege hoss often lies to justify himself but never about the facts indeed he seems proud of his organizational work he and his supposed instigators would have had to be very shrewd to concoct such a coherent and plausible story out of thin air the confessions extorted by the inquisition the moscow trials of the 1930s or the witch hunts had an entirely different tone
563965 death dealer is an important document for all those who seek to understand the killers it is a horrible book horrible in its detail and in its descriptions of the killings but those who wish to understand auschwitz must read this work

563967 the personal interviews given to psychiatrist g martin gilbert during the nuremberg trials and rudolf hosss blunt testimony during the trial itself are consistent with each other to such a degree that we can safely believe that the memoirs written in poland are an elaboration of the nuremberg testimony containing much more detail
563968 today i realize that the extermination of the jews was wrong absolutely wrong it was exactly because of this mass extermination that germany earned itself the hatred of the entire world the cause of anti semitism was not served by this act at all in fact just the opposite the jews have come much closer to their final goal

563974 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
563975 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities

563977 im aware that he saw the footage on tv saturday night and chose to attend mt druitt police station
563978 we let ourselves down particularly at this stage of the season two points is very valuable and we just didnt give it a good shot which really hurts me and the other 16 boys sitting in the dressing room
563979 hes pretty close but hes still got to get through some things at training
563980 as long as theres no setbacks fingers crossed hell be back on the field soon hes a chance next week
563981 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings
563982 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
563983 i knew we just needed one or two partnership i was focusing on ten runs at a time thinking lets just get close
563984 i felt we were just one wicket away if we could have got the likes of morne morkel and paul harris in on that kind of deck i felt we could have won the game

563989 he did train on wednesday night he was fine doing a lot of things but he was a little bit sore changing direction so he decided and we decided together that he wouldnt play against the tigers
563990 saturday morning he did everything at training so wed expect that hed play against melbourne
563991 hes not improving or he didnt improve up until last wednesday so hed be a chance but again hed be more of a chance not to play
563992 gary will probably find a way back into the team and so will wojcinski it just gets done
563993 i think people can accept being dropped to the vfl if they know that gary ablett is coming back in i think they just accept that its just the character we have around the place
563994 its a bit about staying on track and just keeping up our brand of footy that weve been playing and just refining it

563996 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
563997 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections

564002 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
564003 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
564004 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems

564014 i had no odd suspicions about him at all he was a very nice guy he used to come to work every day and pick up his papers and get them to all his customers without any problems
564015 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
564016 and then when i found out in the news that li was being pinned for the brutal attack i was in utter shock
564017 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere
564018 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
564019 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work
564020 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different
564021 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible

564042 youre almost saving 50 percent on bread and bread freezes well
564043 the average american family of four is spending between 800 and 1000 a month if they cut their food bill 50 percent youre talking about saving 400 to 500 a month thats 4800 a year thats a huge savings
564044 a freezer is very very helpful because you can stock up and put it in the freezer
564045 we dont buy all generics not even close but we will on occasion depending on what the product is its gotta be something that really doesnt make a difference
564046 someone who knows how to cook can save the family thousands of dollars
564047 if we can spend two hours organizing all our freezers and taking inventory of what we have in our house and it saves us 500 is it worth two hours definitely
564048 if you do a little research a little planning you can have the same lifestyle essentially but pay less for it why not

564062 if it housing loan rate needs to be revised obviously it would be revised downward
564063 whether we revise it downward or offer discount for festival season from october for a month or a couple of months
564064 rates would definitely not go up whether they remain the same or they move down by 25 basis points is anybodys guess i am not anybody to decide on this but this is my personal view

564101 i just hope i can build on it my first five outings it was hard to realize i was pitching in the big leagues today it was more of a feeling that it was just a baseball game it was the first time i felt like that
564102 det r en stolt glad och fet spark i r ven p all hund gd
564103 over 95 percent of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year
564104 what that says is the transmission rate has been kept very low by prevention efforts
564105 these data corroborate what many of us suspected that the epidemic is worse than we thought however it doesnt seem to be getting worse
564106 the potential for something to happen is much greater now than it was in 2001 simply because of developments of technology and education
564107 we may be putting dangerous pathogens in the hands of people who would deliberately cause harm we may also be putting them in the hands of people who may inadvertently or unintentionally take steps to put large numbers of people at risk
564108 if smallpox returned today we could contain it and minimize the danger very quickly i could not have said that in 2001
564109 was a very important event in the world of bioterrorism preparedness
564110 it did finally wake people up to what bioterrorism could do in this country and in the world
564111 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
564112 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
564113 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
564114 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
564115 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
564116 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
564117 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
564118 ill be at a polling place holding my nose trying to figure out who im going to vote for but that could change
564119 there is a view held by some that illegal immigration lowers the wage scales for legal workers and u s citizens
564120 were removing people for misdemeanor crimes while all sorts of homicides and other crimes are going on unchecked
564121 the overall atmosphere is one of fear and distrust of authority specifically the sheriffs office
564122 these people have no say theyre not unionized they work them 16 hours a day and they can fire them when they want or tell them to leave
564123 under the current system its very hard to get the people you need and get them legally
564124 the bottom line to me is if these guys werent in the country my son would still be alive
564125 when the economy is bad the first thing we do is turn against the immigrants and blame them for all ills
564126 this has happened throughout the history of the united states
564127 we have not been able to see the leading edge of the epidemic
564128 its troubling but not surprising to those who have been working against this epidemic for years
564129 it tells us however where we need to continue to focus our priorities
564130 keeping for inflation that is an actual decrease over the years
564131 over the last eight years the domestic aids epidemic has been starved for resources
564132 we have not been investing sufficient resources in fighting the aids epidemic in black america
564133 we have very few programs designed for and by black gay men
564134 why dont we have a national strategy to address an epidemic with 56 000 cases a year
564135 we would expect that if there was a sudden outbreak of salmonella there would be a national response
564136 im sure the royals knew what they were getting into
564137 and that kind of sums it up they brought him in to be the guy and every once in a while jos wants to flex his muscles crow a little show his feathers whatever i guess thats ok
564138 really the only question becomes is it a distraction to the other players and the team i really dont think it is not from what ive observed
564139 i know trey has done everything he can do to keep communication going
564140 i didnt go on the last trip to oakland when all the stuff about the rift came out i kept thinking to myself wow they look like theyve been getting along fine what the heck happened in the last 24 hours i dont think anything did
564141 everyone we had was interested in being part of the team and looking out for each other we didnt have just one player who was the guy we had five or six guys who stood out and kind of kept everyone else in line
564142 i think it was the same way for jos guillen in seattle
564143 ive always said it keeps me in the game more
564144 im not directly relating it to why i had a good day at the plate
564145 today was scorching out there it was a good win for the team
564146 mark buehrle is a great pitcher and more times than not he has had our number to get on a guy like that shows it was our day at the plate
564147 it depends what we need to do with our lineup
564148 right now hosey jos guillen is unable to play in the outfield
564149 you dont like to see anybody get hurt like grudzielanek did he got clipped pretty good
564150 its good to have a guy in who has as much versatility as smitty does
564151 we will use him as needed he provides more sock for us off the bench hes got a history of driving the ball he has the ability to play all over the infield and im not afraid to throw him in the outfield
564152 honestly i can say thats the hottest ive been on a baseball field
564153 whenever i had a chance i went down to the batting cage to get into the a c
564154 when you think about it youre not just battling the other team youre also battling mother nature with the heat out there its just a matter of executing when you need to
564155 were only winning by one but we get a bomb and its a different game
564156 we go out there with a lot of confidence with our ace on the mound
564157 then we score three runs in the first two innings and we cant hold it
564158 you get ahead of a guy and cant stick him away that happens you cant leave it over the middle obviously
564159 but when i hit that home run i was thinking thats another run for soria
564160 when i hear the fans booing at me it gets to my heart its bad for me
564161 i wish the fans understood how much power they have
564162 we are back in the same situation we were in before the girl was due to go back she is well and when i saw her last week she said she had made some friends at the care facility we are in contact with british immigration officials but we do not know what they intend to do
564163 im sorry it was a kind of prank i hope he wasnt hurt
564164 lord protect my family and me forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will
564165 we dont know if blogs polarize their readers or if highly ideological readers gravitate to blogs that reflect their partisanship
564166 i think this stuff is going to change over time the blog world took shape at an extremely politically polarized time and the polarization was still there in 2006
564167 how much of the constitution do you want to give up
564168 if you are on the ballot you are in the debate
564169 and then i will at last be able to put
564170 senator clinton is expected to do well in texas in large part due to the large latino population
564171 if you are not angry you have not been paying attention
564172 if you are not angry you are severely retarded or a war profiteering criminal
564173 oh ed is your father in law no matter what are you crazy
564174 in the language of the law de facto and de jure the hindu temple of preah vihear belongs to cambodia
564175 the situation here is getting bad it has not been like this before
564176 both countries have ordered soldiers near the border they are facing each other
564177 as a member of the united nations thailand had to accept the ruling and hand the temple over to cambodia in the decades since there has been no legal bid to reclaim the site
564178 in the language of the law de facto and de jure the hindu temple of preah vihear belongs to cambodia
564179 bruised nationalism is stimulating feelings of hatred between thais and cambodian
564180 anti cambodian sentiment is growing stronger as thais who consider themselves superior to their southeastern neighbours feel they have lost face because of the temple
564181 we the ministry have already assigned the department of cinematography and the viet nam feature film studio to actively prepare for the project and ensure that the studio improves the films script and finalises its budget estimate
564182 we also need to bring on board an experienced foreign professional whose expertise in cinema will enhance the project this will bring quality to the film even though the cost will be very high
564183 we will make a grave error if we fail to make this film as we owe it to the people to record this important period of our history
564184 we should redefine the scale and time that is needed to produce the film king ly cong uan the ha noi authorities need to clearly decentralise the rights of the related agencies so that everyone can progress on the project
564185 the viet nam feature film studio needs to define the general director or main director of the project or come up with a group of directors to head it it should also make specific regulations for the group so there is no confusion on responsibilities and tasks assigned to each person
564186 we need to make high quality historical films for the younger generation so that they can better understand where we come from
564187 we will make a grave error if we fail to make this film as we owe it to the people to record this important period of our history
564188 many today feel that vietnamese historical films lack the creativity to inspire they remain monotone their aesthetic qualities leaving much to be desired when compared to films from neighbouring countries like china and south korea
564189 with such few historical and culture sites to use as backdrops film makers have difficulties making period films especially in scriptwriting or making costumes
564190 the film will be shot in many places in viet nam and will require putting up sets in the ancient capital of hoa lu
564191 it is not a wasteful expenditure all these sets will be used again for other historical films and tourists will visit them in the future we have also visited china to check out studios where historical films are made
564192 payments to foreign experts are very high between 40 000 and 60 000 per person a month
564193 a large expense will go towards filming scenes in kunming and shanghai in china because ancient citadels and ramparts no longer exist in viet nam
564194 the viet nam feature film studio must step up the pace if it wants to screen king ly cong uan in 2010
564195 everything is very slow and 2010 is not that far away the studio spent over two years choosing a literary work and a year turning it into a film
564196 we have not received the screenplay from the films director luu trong ninh
564197 film makers could learn from ha noi and hcm city theatre groups which have staged many interesting dramas featuring historical figures
564198 if ha noi authorities approve our budget we will start work in november
564199 there will be three units working simultaneously in china and viet nam this is the first great film about a king in viet nam we are facing a challenge and we will succeed no matter how many people are anxious about our capability

564245 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings he told aap
564246 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
564247 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them

564250 compare it with the way prime minister kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan are going were on the verge of a rudd recession after 11 golden years of costello and howard mr abbott said
564251 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
564252 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december he said
564253 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
564254 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
564255 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
564256 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would
564257 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world he told abc television
564258 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
564259 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
564260 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
564261 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies mr rudd told the nine network
564262 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices mr rudd said
564263 so on that score i ve got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past

564418 a fascinating debate about modern vs traditional approaches to teaching chaucer rapping and youtube and television what exactly is their place in medieval studies it may come as a surprise to many of you but we are lucky enough to have baba brinkman in the room right now and im hoping hell be willing to comment on the ongoing discussion of his work
564419 its pretty surreal for me to hear you all debating the merits of my rap adaptation as a pedagogical tool especially since thats definitely not the purpose that i wrote it for im happy that its found a home in the classroom and that some teachers have found it useful but my original motivation when writing the rap canterbury tales wasnt to help you to teach chaucer it was to wrest chaucer away from you people and bring him to a wider audience outside the classroom thats why i brought the show to the edinburgh festival and to dozens of other festivals around the world i thought it was a tragedy that the canterbury tales was only being enjoyed by people with a medieval studies education when the tales have a universal appeal and deserve to have a universal audience so use the rap version at your own risk and please judge it on its own merit after listening for yourself instead of through the lens of your prejudice about rap and keep in mind that from performing this show to tens of thousands of people around the world over the past five years i am now the face of chaucer not you all i think the tales should be studied because they are loved not loved because they are studied and im trying to make people love the tales again so come see the show tonight and youll see how i do that

564562 secure the bangsamoros identity and posterity protect their property rights and resources as well as establish a system of governance suitable and acceptable to them as a distinct dominant people
564563 held under claim of ownership occupied or possessed by themselves or through the ancestors of the bangsamoro people communally or individually since time immemorial continuously to the present except when prevented by war civil disturbance force majeure or other forms of possible usurpation or displacement by force deceit stealth or as a consequence of a government project or any other voluntary dealings entered into by the government and private individuals corporate entities or institutions
564564 the bangsamoro homeland and historic territory refer to the land mass as well as the maritime terrestrial fluvial and alluvial domains and the aerial domain the atmospheric space above it embracing the mindanao sulu palawan region
564565 it is the birthright of all moros and all indigenous peoples of mindanao to identify themselves and be accepted as bangsamoro the bangsamoro people refers to those who are natives or original inhabitants of mindanao and its adjacent islands including palawan and the sulu archipelago at the time of conquest or colonization of their descendants whether mixed or of full native blood spouses and their descendants are classified as bangsamoro the freedom of choice of the indigenous people shall be respected
564566 this will lead to the signing of the moa on ancestral domain on aug 5
564567 we have to be creative and innovative in transporting the machines and in retrieving them after the elections
564568 from the main municipal hall to the barangay where some of the schools are located it sometimes takes two hours of travel the problem is the roads are so bad that even 4 x 4 vehicles have difficulty reaching the area
564569 another problem is the liguasan marsh in the easternmost part of the province since its a marshland the waters rise fast so we are using bancas
564570 we have five provinces and some of the places are remote but the fact is the counting station is different from the voting stations the precincts may be very remote but the counting centers are in schools with reasonable infrastructure
564571 so basically we are more or less 95 98 percent ready for aug 11
564572 in fact the afp western mindanao command will deploy 5 545 personnel while the eastern mindanao command 5 700 the pnp has likewise committed 7 596 personnel
564573 the deployment of military troops in indigenous communities under the guise of protecting the national economy but at the expense of the ips is ridiculous

564575 in mindanao for example the lumads of compostela valley and subanens of zamboanga del norte are being pushed away from their homes by the easement rights granted to foreign mining firms by the arroyo government any resistance is immediately quashed through the deployment of military and paramilitary forces and men women and children who show the slightest hint of opposition are tortured harassed raped and murdered
564576 this situation not only sows terror among indigenous women and children but also destroys the key source of livelihood and identity for the indigenous peoples
564577 the deployment of military troops in indigenous communities under the guise of protecting the national economy but at the expense of the ips is ridiculous

564589 the queen and the queensmen do not owe anyone the truth
564590 the oil companies alleged engagement in overpricing profiteering transfer pricing and other forms of cartel operations in the philippines
564591 the house committee on trade and industry has the mandate and golden opportunity to help the suffering people by conducting an investigation on pilipinas shell chevron philippines formerly caltex and petron who have increased pump prices 22 times this year
564592 for the june 2007 to june 2008 period average pump prices of unleaded gasoline and diesel have increased by 47 and 52 respectively this has jacked up prices of food rice and public transport fares that are heightening the sufferings of the people
564593 domestic profits do not fully reflect the oil monopolies overall profits because the transnational oil firms local subsidiaries are merely booking their profits abroad through the deceitful practice of transfer pricing to deflect criticisms of their massive windfall profits
564594 continue to gain billions of profits and that local pump prices of petroleum products are overpriced by p12 per liter
564595 since republic act 8479 or the oil deregulation law was enacted a decade ago the country has experienced unabated increases in oil prices contrary to the laws supposed intent to lower oil prices and break up the local oil cartel since the start of oil deregulation in 1996 pump prices of unleaded gas have increased by 492 percent and prices of diesel have increased by 607 percent with oil firms acting in unison as a cartel the latest incident of a three peso increase in the price of diesel immediately followed by a p1 50 rollback upon the presidents appeal reveals the arbitrary and whimsical manner by which oil prices are being set in the country
564596 despite moves to investigate and resolve the matter the executive branch particularly the departments of energy and justice has miserably failed to provide government and the public a reasonable and well informed explanation of the oil price movements in the country the house should thus make its move to immediately address this issue
564597 a good excuse for not being in the us in august
564598 pretentious poet party amp special guest bethany from colombia rain change for andrews pond party
564599 we had a candid conversation with her and our unity as ngos here is to present to her documented records of oceanagolds poor rating in terms of corporate social responsibility

564601 we were told we would be treated as new employees because there is a change in management
564602 if a workers performance does not fit into the qualifications of the job are you going to rehire him
564603 if the employees decide later to organize a new union we will welcome it but as of now there is no employees union registered at snap benguet
564604 if we want students to learn we must show them how
564605 the bands you are talking about gig a lot more than you do and they are way more talented you while you sit home playing no gigs at all so you have no right to criticize a band when youre music have no talent yourself
564606 it is the poor women who have to scamper for food face military atrocities and secure the whole family from environmental threats due to mining
564607 people could not get anything from their own lands because the government owned the minerals 50 meters underground

564614 this is a generally peaceful province but it has its share in the regions problems

564620 this is to signify our unified call for the end of discrimination against us lesbians gays bi sexuals and trans genders lgbt
564621 majority of us come from the exploited and oppressed classes in society but besides the common economic and social problems that we encounter we are further burdened by a particular form of oppression called homophobia or the irrational fear and hatred of homosexuals which is a result of ignorance and fear
564622 i really love my tita whatever she is and i owe it to her because she has been teaching me not to be homophobic ever since i could remember
564623 i am here to support the calls of the gays and lesbians for equal rights they are also human beings and part of society and should be accepted

564625 it is known as ilps concern 18 and during that assembly we were able to come up with a resolution to uphold lgbt rights and fight against discrimination intolerance and homophobia

564650 no come o normal sentir falta de entrosamento e ter algumas dificuldades agora estou mais adaptado ao clube me sentindo mais solto e com o tempo tenho muito o que crescer
564651 com certeza esse per odo fora me atrapalhou porque todos meus companheiros atuavam e eu tinha que esperar pelos jogos da libertadores mas isso passado agora seguir trabalhando para ter novas oportunidades
564652 todo jogador trabalha para ser titular e eu n o sou diferente nosso ataque tem excelentes jogadores e o muricy sempre pode contar com boas op es por isso sigo trabalhando e me empenhando para voltar ao time e ajudar o clube
564653 no s o paulo nenhum jogador ter vaga assegurada nunca pois um grande time que conta sempre com grandes jogadores e tem uma cobran a di ria
564654 para eu ser mantido no time titular tenho que continuar jogando bem
564655 nosso time joga com muita varia o e pela esquerda temos grandes jogadores que est o sempre trocando de posi es o jorge costuma atacar pelo meio enquanto eu abro mais na ponta na cobertura a mesma coisa temos sempre que estar atentos aos movimentos do companheiro para preencher os espa os

564687 compare it with the way prime minister kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan are going
564688 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
564689 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december he said
564690 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
564691 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
564692 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
564693 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would safety scares
564694 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
564695 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
564696 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
564697 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
564698 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
564699 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
564700 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
564701 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
564702 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
564703 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
564704 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
564705 to be honest i didnt think that it would happen in this tournament because last week i played really bad
564706 and i was injured before so i didnt do nothing basically for two weeks
564707 its tough to beat a guy like that with a second serve

564712 in all the australian employers that ive met are they ready for that challenge do they have the heart for that challenge do they have the ability to meet this challenge the answers absolutely yes
564713 a welfare only response to these communities is precisely the wrong way to go
564714 weve got to get housing right weve got to get education right weve got to get health right but weve also got to get jobs right
564715 and thats where corporate australia comes in and i look forward very much to partnering with our major australian corporations in what is their initiative
564716 ive hung around corporate australia for a number of years ive heard a lot of goodwill from people but ive never been actually sure about whether those doors are openable from the outside
564717 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings
564718 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
564719 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them

564721 the number of retail outlets selling ethanol blend has increased three fold over the past two years concentrating in queensland and new south wales and to a lesser extent in south australia and victoria

564732 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities safety scares
564733 please tell me again why we are plodding through the wilds of the dark forest at sunset

564736 were almost there just round the bend and through that copse of trees

564742 i should hope our destination isnt much further it will be dark soon
564743 and i see no reason to be so cryptic as to the identity of your benefactor
564744 besides if id told you who this was for youd never have agreed to brew it
564745 hell be along any minute may i have the phial please
564746 i really appreciate your efforts and i know he will too in a right bad state he is
564747 aislins best is extremely difficult to brew and i had to use the last of my narffle bladder i shall have to apparate all the way to ceylon to replenish it
564748 and my supply of gryphon scales is nearly depleted as well

564762 oh good one that what was i supposed to do blurt out over tea some night that i was shagging the giant squid
564763 it was years ago and nothings happened since were just friends now
564764 no more upsetting or nauseating than the idea of you and one argus filch riding the sodding hobby horse
564765 yes i am but i didnt use magic to find out you talk in your sleep
564766 seems like were more suited to each other than you realize
564767 but filch was quite the looker in his younger days if i may say and very very talented

564769 weve a fresh jar of that lavender lubricant you enjoy and id like to share a few tricks that i learned from my many limbed friend
564770 indeed i have one or two techniques of my own that i think may be quite appropriate
564771 an immediate ban on toe grabs with a height greater than two millimeters bends jar caulks stickers and any other appliance worn on the front shoes of thoroughbred horses while racing or training on all racing surfaces
564772 animals being brutally killed in canned hunts in clinch mountain tennessee with no chance of surviv

564776 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere professor mallavarapu said in a statement
564777 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
564778 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work prof mallavarapu said
564779 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different he said
564780 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible
564781 if you want to see reasoned analysis at its best you have to read the paragraph farmer
564782 my friend patrick ohannigan shows why he is the jimi hendrix of pundits
564783 frankly i think patrick ohannigan ought to be out there making a bazillion dollars from his writing
564784 i think if he would have caught that ball the momentum would have stayed where it was
564785 but the fact that he missed the ball then threw it home and got the out was huge i came out of the dugout and the whole team seemed to catch fire right then
564786 if were doing well he just seems to do so much better so we kind of rode a wave of good luck and some good timely hitting and then kyle just stepped up his game

564790 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
564791 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
564792 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
564793 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

564796 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
564797 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
564798 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
564799 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
564800 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
564801 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
564802 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
564803 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
564804 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
564805 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

564821 the fund is a vehicle by which foreign governments can help support our initiatives without exerting any influence over our national policy
564822 we are committed to reducing the destruction of the rainforest to eliminating illegal burning and to guaranteeing a better quality of life for all
564823 our war is not won by simply reducing illegal burning in one month it will be won once this environmental model that is destroying our communities and biodiversity is history
564824 overall this group of iraqi police has made a dramatic improvement in their capabilities since the first day we picked them up
564825 the program will be successful if they are able to pass that proficiency on to the rest of their force
564826 we designed the iraqi police master trainer program to try to get the biggest impact from a small element of u s soldiers
564827 the program has changed a great deal from its initial stage through input from everyone in the platoon we hand picked iraqi police who displayed leadership potential at their stations and brought them in for training
564828 these guys have come a long way since the beginning and they are using what we have taught them
564829 at the beginning they would run disorganized into a room to clear it now the last day of training they are going into the room in a stack

564835 one man is reportedly a liaison between al qaeda network in iraq aqi leaders in mosul and the foreign terrorist network in northwest iraq

564842 its moving to know you are the difference between someone living and dying
564843 knowing the military has given me the capabilities to make a difference to get within that golden hour and help someone its awe striking
564844 these people are starved for jobs but even some well off individuals are showing a large amount of interest and pride in the ia
564845 everyone seemed upbeat and prideful of the opportunity to serve in the ia
564846 i sure hope some of these people get called up as this is yet again another demonstration of just how ready they are to work in a legitimate arm of the government and contribute to the peace and stability that we are currently enjoying this crowd was so big and enthusiastic that the mobile recruiting team is coming back to finish the job up
564847 the burns looked like they were a week and a half old it looked like a small infection had begun
564848 i came back because i got a job here to help both the iraqis and americans supporting the war on terrorism
564849 its always good to help the iraqis to know whats going on and what they are going through
564850 for me there is no greater reward to be able to help somebody put a smile on somebodys face
564851 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004
564852 there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
564853 because of these operations extremists who once terrorized the citizens of these communities have been driven from their strongholds
564854 was able to walk the streets of sadr city last wednesday
564855 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
564856 the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
564857 beginning tomorrow troops deploying to iraq will serve 12 month tours instead of 15 month tours
564858 this will ease the burden on our forces it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
564859 if i do not perform my fathers works do not believe me but if i perform them even if you do not believe me believe the works so that you may realize and understand that the father is in me and i am in the father
564860 i feel that a public humiliation has to be rescinded with a public apology when mr clark or mr holden issue their public apology id be happy to sign their citation
564861 i opened it up and saw the four signatures and wondered if we had a four member board of selectmen all of a sudden
564862 this shows more evidence that mary isnt really able to do whats right for the town and rise above her personal agenda and partisanship
564863 it had nothing to do with how they voted on other issues
564864 what individual members sign and dont sign you have to ask the individual members
564865 i personally think its good to thank people in writing for their hard work
564866 he just lost control of his truck after being cut off
564867 an average size plant that makes hot mix asphalt uses on average 20 000 gallons of diesel fuel a week
564868 on top of that we have seen a major increase in the price of the liquid asphalt thats the glue the liquid asphalt
564869 were looking to be over 700 per ton for liquid asphalt and possibly over 900 by september
564870 were not going to know right now what asphalt prices could do to the cost of the project
564871 we budget in any increase in costs so were not going to see any over runs
564872 if we dont need it it goes back into the capital fund or the general fund i think everybody kind of saw the writing on the wall before these projects were put out to bid
564873 asked for an escalation clause this year but we didnt bid it that way
564874 the highest bid was 71 a ton that is very very cheap with no escalation clause
564875 as it increases it just means its more costly to do the work
564876 so maybe we do less work theres no deep well of money anywhere
564877 the infrastructure is crumbling but you just plow through it and get what we can get done you have to pick the worst and go that way wed love to be able to do more roadwork regardless of the cost but thats just not realistic
564878 youre always assessing all of your operations and making necessary determinations and its important to the board and management that youre looking at all opportunities
564879 as much as were spending a lot of time managing the commercial side of it weve also been able to add a mortgage lender because weve been quite busy on the residential side she said
564880 the results were frightening and even more frightening was the fact that there was no discussion in the press release of their strategy to deal with their loan and capital issues he said
564881 im not here to chastise them about making the bad loans
564882 what im very disappointed with is they dont tell us a strategy
564883 aunque siempre que hablamos de personas adictas al trabajo pensamos en ejecutivos porque son los m s llamativos lo cierto es que este perfil de personas puede ir desde el agricultor que planta lechugas hasta que se va el sol obsesionado por obtener m s y m s resultado hasta el alto ejecutivo o el ama de casa que tienen que tener la casa impecable los hijos perfectos que cocina pasteles y que se apunta a un curso de macram

564889 there was a question whether that was operating or working properly

564895 since i plan to speak with prime minister singh president hu jintao and already did so with bush we will see if it is possible to return to the negotiating table

564910 why what happened i told the gate you were coming

564912 yeah i told him three times dude im from at amp t she doesnt have a phone yet
564913 when i was growing up in san jose california and got hooked on horror films it wasnt the classic ones that got me but the dime a dozen quickies turned out by the smaller companies to my mind creature from the black lagoon was a classic horror film but the ones i remember enjoying the most excluding my favorite invasion of the body snatchers were the creature with the atom brain tarantula invasion of the saucer men the undead and the black sleep my favorite horror stars were bela lugosi and believe it or not tor johnson

564919 this decision is an insult to all police officers and is nothing more than a green light for those evil thugs who have a complete disregard for life itself and think nothing of killing a police officer
564920 granting an evil calculated killer any kind of dispensation is criminal and leaves the judiciary with blood on its hands
564921 i urge you to do whatever is needed to reverse this travesty of justice
564922 this is shockingly disrespectful to his memory and illustrates the utter travesty of our criminal justice system where the rights of a cop killer outweigh the rights of a fallen officers family friends and colleagues
564923 keep reminding them of these things warn them before god against quarreling about words it is of no value and only ruins those who listen do your best to present yourself to god as one approved a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth avoid godless chatter because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly
564924 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
564925 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
564926 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
564927 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
564928 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
564929 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
564930 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
564931 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
564932 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
564933 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
564934 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
564935 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
564936 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
564937 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries
564938 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect

564954 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december he said
564955 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
564956 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
564957 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
564958 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would
564959 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings
564960 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
564961 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them
564962 were flight attendants we have to fly in the aircraft its just a natural request
564963 the number of retail outlets selling ethanol blend has increased three fold over the past two years concentrating in queensland and new south wales and to a lesser extent in south australia and victoria

564965 although men have higher incidence and mortality from all non sex specific forms of cancer than women the public face of cancer in our study was overwhelmingly female
564966 this imbalance in television reportage of cancer may be distorting political and community perceptions about which cancers are most prevalent and tractable and thereby deserving of government and community support research investment and individual vigilance
564967 for example breast cancer attracts unparalleled research funding from individuals and governments while other cancers causing more disability struggle to gain a fraction of such support
564968 as a former australian health minister commented its not sexy to have testicular or prostate cancer so you dont get a run in the media
564969 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
564970 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
564971 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities
564972 weve got to get housing right weve got to get education right weve got to get health right but weve also got to get jobs right and thats where corporate australia comes in

564975 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work prof mallavarapu said
564976 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different he said
564977 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible

565012 it would be nice to be as spiritual as i was three years ago
565013 im aware that he saw the footage on tv saturday night and chose to attend mt druitt police station
565014 received correspondence from the president of guinea purporting to rescind the simandou mining concession
565015 rio tinto negotiated and executed the simandou mining concession in full transparency with the guinea government and is currently in discussion with relevant ministers with a view to resolving any issues
565016 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
565017 tim spent his life travelling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
565018 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
565019 we are requesting the media and the public for privacy
565020 is defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
565021 okay badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
565022 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
565023 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
565024 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
565025 i had no odd suspicions about him at all he was a very nice guy he used to come to work every day and pick up his papers and get them to all his customers without any problems
565026 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
565027 and then when i found out in the news that li was being pinned for the brutal attack i was in utter shock
565028 we had a weaker session on wall street on friday down by 51 points that may drag our market down in the order of 20 to 30 points
565029 while the market may get off to a sluggish start there will be a number of companies that will benefit from both a weaker australian dollar and also talk that the reserve bank might cut rates in the coming months
565030 in fact with the market now pricing in rate cuts the ride for the australian dollar could be pretty rough over the next six months with a fall back to around us 85 cents a distinct possibility
565031 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere
565032 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
565033 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work
565034 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different
565035 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible
565036 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings
565037 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
565038 i knew we just needed one or two partnership i was focusing on ten runs at a time thinking lets just get close
565039 i felt we were just one wicket away if we could have got the likes of morne morkel and paul harris in on that kind of deck i felt we could have won the game
565040 theyve played better cricket than us over the three games
565041 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
565042 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
565043 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
565044 difficult to negotiate an accord when unemployment is on the rise and the economy is weakening
565045 a 40 percent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
565046 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
565047 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
565048 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
565049 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems
565050 it is very disappointing to see the new cabinet list
565051 the new cabinet cannot give thais any hope in dealing with the economic situation
565052 with nonstop protests against the government samak had no choice but to replace some of his unpopular ministers

565111 an annual family meeting can help you create a comfortable forum for discussing your values priorities and goals related to managing money and important details about your wishes for the disposition of your estate family meetings also enable parents to clarify their intentions related to any possible misunderstanding that might arise from disproportionate splits of an estate this is especially important when re marriages and second families are involved or when parents want to name charities or unknown entities as beneficiaries

565115 isnt the point of having money aside for trying to provide a comfortable lifestyle to try and help out those less fortunate wouldnt a struggling daughter fit that bill
565116 if parents are themselves stretched financially they dont have to actually shell out money for the child rather they can provide a roof and help that way
565117 experts say there is no right answer because the dynamics of each family are different
565118 to have a plan preferably in writing that spells out the new relationship it can be as simple as a contribution toward household expenses or it can be chapter and verse but the reunited family needs rules

565164 es grav sima la situaci n que se est creando all pues est resurgiendo un conflicto que pensamos estaba cerrado
565165 que durante el d a de ayer 28 de julio aproximadamente a las 19 hrs fue interceptado y detenido por carabineros el destacado dirigente de la comunidad de yeupeko mauricio huaiquilao huaiquilao al que luego de dar innumerables vueltas es golpeado e interrogado

565168 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
565169 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa

565192 wed like to film between sept 2 and oct 2
565193 but im in limbo until the guild decides whether to strike or not
565194 theyre afraid to go ahead with filming if theres a strike coming

565196 and given the spirit of the movie that actually would be appropriate the original was an independent movie with no big names but today hollywood demands one or two stars if your film is going to be seen
565197 weve come a long way since march when i first starting pushing for this movie weve got a budget including lots of independent money from the kansas city area writers actors we havent wasted a minute but if the guild doesnt settle with the studios soon well have to think about shooting in the spring

565437 la mejor manera es mantener la boca cerrada en algunos momentos yo s lo que he vivido en primera persona y muchos de mis compa eros tambi n
565438 un hombre que es el futbolista que m s a os ha jugado en el f tbol profesional en la historia del levante once temporadas creo que tendr a que tener m s de una l nea en la p gina oficial
565439 si hubiese optado por buscarse otra salida la hubiera encontrado y estaba vinculado a un club a una ciudad
565440 merece un lugar importante entre los deportistas del levante y me gustar a que se reconociera desde el club y la afici n
565441 le voy a dar a mi familia mucho protagonismo en la decisi n
565442 el recreativo como el valladolid son equipos sufridores pero tememos que intentar la salvaci n antes de salir de cuentas
565443 el recreativo tiene una buena plantilla excelentes jugadores y est haciendo buenos fichajes
565444 es una decepci n saber que teniendo la oportunidad de organizar una competici n con m ltiples equipos tras el resultado de la decisi n del tribunal de apelaci n bmw oracle ha elegido retrasar a n m s la 33 copa del am rica
565445 tras malgastar m s de un a o en el litigio y perder sus argumentos bmw oracle ha acudido a los tribunales por segunda vez para forzar su estrategia de eliminar a los distintos equipos de la americas cup inscritos como desaf os leg timos
565446 m s competitiva y cercana a los espectadores de la historia a pesar de los intentos no fruct feros durante un a o de limitar la competici n a un duelo entre dos equipos
565447 bmw oracle intenta ahora retrasar y frustrar la marcha de la americas cup presentando una apelaci n fr vola y que se prolongar en el tiempo
565448 bmw oracle no fue capaz de avanzar hasta la ronda final de la americas cup durante la 31 y la 32 edici n ya que fue eliminado en la ronda de regatas eliminatorias de los desaf os en ambas ocasiones
565449 la oferta del madrid por van der vaart es como una broma
565450 a m s del 99 por ciento del n mero de acciones adheridas a dicha acta
565451 no s lo no vamos a impugnar esa junta de agosto sino que tampoco voy a presentar la demanda sobre la impugnaci n que ten a de la junta general ordinaria del pasado 10 de noviembre renuncio por el bien del valencia y a cambio de nada
565452 no cuenta con consentimiento de todos los accionistas de ese acta
565453 sanchis ha actuado unilateralmente y quiero desmentir que haya un grupo opositor importante
565454 all ya tendr n que dar todas las explicaciones pero no procede que ahora un nuevo consejo d explicaciones de lo que ha hecho otro consejo de administraci n
565455 ahora en estos momentos de extrema dificultad para nuestro valencia debemos dejar trabajar al nuevo presidente y a su consejo y dentro de un tiempo como en toda sociedad analizar y en su caso si procede censurar la gesti n social del mismo
565456 me ha molestado mucho que dijera que va a vigilar la gesti n del valencia para eso ya estamos los accionistas si es accionista como dice le espero en la pr xima junta general en la cual tendr el gusto de acompa arme en mi exposici n cr tica sobre la situaci n econ mica del club
565457 por el momento parecer a que el n mero de muertos entre ayer y hoy sea de cuatro a cinco
565458 la expedici n estaba compuesta por 18 alpinistas de lo que s lo cinco o seis han regresado al campo 4
565459 ha sido lo m s grande hasta ahora pero yo voy a intentar algo distinto algo nunca visto
565460 las medallas las veo muy dif cil las favoritas son eeuu australia y rusia son tres equipos que est n un pasito por delante del resto no como en el baloncesto masculino que se ha igualado todo bastante aunque siempre puede dar alguien la sorpresa
565461 el equipo ha hecho ltimamente unos torneos muy buenos ganando incluso a rusia en su casa
565462 el segundo el tercero y el cuarto van a estar entre china rep blica checa y nosotras el nivel de los tres es muy parecido por lo que el m s m nimo detalle puede hacer que quedes tanto segunda como cuarta
565463 el ambiente es muy bonito es algo especial todo el rollo que se habla del esp ritu ol mpico es verdad es muy interesante convivir con gente de otros deportes algo que no puedes hacer en otras competiciones
565464 lo he tirado yo eh eh no es que se haya ido l s lo
565465 me clasifiqu en el campeonato del mundo del a o pasado y por eso he podido preparar los juegos con m s tiempo
565466 llevo entren ndome desde octubre para el d a de la competici n el 11 de agosto y no he tenido ninguna lesi n que me haya dejado apartada de los entrenamientos
565467 ahora ya lo que salga estoy muy motivada y muy ilusionada porque unos juegos ol mpicos siempre son importantes y da igual que sean mis primeros o mis cuartos
565468 s es cierto que tengo m s experiencia pero la gente viene muy preparada no somos tantas judocas pero todas las que est n son buen simas
565469 las rivales m s dif ciles son las asi ticas una coreana del norte que me gan en la final del mundial una japonesa y una china que est subiendo y participa en casa aunque eso tambi n es presi n para ella
565470 posibilidades siempre crees que hay si no no vendr as aqu
565471 esta villa ol mpica s que tiene m s jardines y laguitos que otras en las que he estado y se hace m s agradable la de atenas tambi n estaba muy bien en la de sydney sin embargo no hab a tanto espacio
565472 el pabell n de espa a est muy bien situado dentro de la villa porque tenemos enfrente el comedor que es lo que m s visitas y tambi n los autobuses para ir a los entrenamientos
565473 se come bien aunque la carne no var a mucho los tres d as que hab a ternera eran los mismos filetes a m que me gusta tanto
565474 cuando llegue a espa a me voy a comer una paella alicantina que es la que m s me gusta
565475 ninguna queja de la organizaci n ning n problema de momento todo muy bien
565476 ahora s que voy a ser el n mero uno y estoy muy muy feliz de serlo ser el n mero uno del mundo siempre es un regalo por todo el trabajo hecho anteriormente eso me satisface mucho pero para ser el n mero uno tienes que ganar roland garros wimbledon
565477 son cosas dif ciles de comparar pero cuando ganas roland garros es el momento es un momento muy emotivo llegar al n mero uno es una recompensa al trabajo hecho
565478 fichar a van der vaart depende de ellos si el real madrid ofreciera 16 millones por cristiano ronaldo la gente se reir a lo mismo ocurre con lo que ofrecen por rafael es como una broma
565479 en los ltimos d as han habido muchos rumores y problemas por eso ha sido mejor no alinear al jugador en estos momentos
565480 todo el mundo sabe nuestra posici n sobre el jugador y lo que hemos dicho todav a sigo pensando que formar parte del equipo la pr xima semana llevamos semanas hablando de van der vaart necesitamos una explicaci n final
565481 han ido m s r pidos que nosotros durante el fin de semana
565482 salimos s ptimos pero delante hay dos ferrari dos mclaren un toyota y un bmw que han ido todo el fin de semana m s r pido que nosotros pensar que ma ana vamos a adelantarles es pecar de optimistas pero vamos a intentarlo
565483 las primeras vueltas del neum tico son cruciales cuanto menos tires y menos los deteriores luego cuando empieces a correr de verdad estar n en mejores condiciones y se puede llegar a ser m s constante en alemania se confirm nelsinho puso unos neum ticos nuevos en el pit stop y dio las primeras seis vueltas tras el coche de seguridad luego cuando tir los neum ticos estaban en muy buenas condiciones
565484 espero que ma ana el ritmo de carrera sea bueno y tambi n los reglajes siempre hay que buscar un equilibrio entre lo que pueda dar el coche en la crono y en la carrera hay que hacer reglajes que se acomoden a las dos cosas en la crono no ha ido bien pero tampoco mal y ma ana en carrera ojal vayan bien
565485 intentar adelantar a raikkonen porque voy por el lado limpio de la pista en la parrilla en las tres ltimas carreras he perdido una posici n en la arrancada espero en esta ocasi n aguantar la posici n tengo mantener la s ptima como sea
565486 ronaldinho ha tra do un gran entusiasmo hemos hecho otros 20 000 abonados m s desde su llegada hemos alcanzado los 33 000 m s de los que tuvimos tras la victoria en la liga de campeones
565487 kak seguir en el mil n el jugador tiene contrato es in til desestabilizarle
565488 no queremos dinero de ning n club queremos que contin e con nosotros el jugador del a o en alemania en 2007
565489 os democratas deveriam estar goleando mas n o est o
565490 ele nunca foi testado as pessoas ainda t m muitas d vidas sobre obama
565491 os eleitores independentes e os republicanos menos convictos ainda est o examinando os dois candidatos cabe a obama convenc los de que est altura do cargo de presidente
565492 a essa altura na elei o de 1980 carter estava frente de reagan em certo ponto por m houve uma virada
565493 maxims actions seem to completely lack journalistic integrity and intentionally mislead their readership
565494 the project was originally going to be self titled but as we were working on it all the pieces fell into place perfectly and i realized that from track to track it was telling a story which had real movement
565495 were really taking a journey starting out with e machine and americans on the mend fitting perfectly into todays economic and political climates
565496 the beauty of the album is in how the pieces landed together
565497 the name of the band came to me when i had a dream one night i was walking through the woods and sitting in a camp with some people was a spiritual shaman so i asked him what should i call my band he said wildfire i woke up and knew that had to be the name when it came to the spelling i thought of the word zephyr which means wind it just had a cool ring to it
565498 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
565499 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
565500 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities
565501 my god why are people always comparing government officials to satan one has to see if each official carries out his duties honestly according to the orders received from the president
565502 our clients want to raise their social profile but they want to do it in a better way
565503 ultimately they do business with us because they believe it will affect their bottom line
565504 weve had a number of corporate social responsibility programs since our inception
565505 we were looking to partner with someone with expertise in that area who could help solidify our position and grow
565506 operates at the retail level it feels authentic and it feels local
565507 consumer trust in big business is about as low as it has ever been
565508 there is a huge risk of backlash if people think that youre not being sincere or authentic in the initiatives that youre taking in the marketplace
565509 everything you say and do should magnify your profile with your constituencies
565510 but it has to be in a way that does not feel self congratulatory
565511 even when youve got the best mousetrap youre not necessarily going to be welcomed with open arms
565512 its easy to get carried away by the capabilities of a new technology
565513 we all decided we needed to find clients that wanted to make more money
565514 were interested in this primarily to make money for our shareholders
565515 rare that a company says go form your own team and go address this issue
565516 nothing was getting done except people were spending a lot of time talking
565517 the way i created this company the employees sort of follow my personality and my personality is to be very competitive
565518 in a competitive environment this is what works best it allows these people to take control they can do as much as they want to do and can advance as much as they want
565519 has to be done in a culture where people understand they just cant blow off everything else theyre doing
565520 i said you did nothing and i propose you get nothing
565521 people started thinking we created a whole new product for the company and these guys painted the lunch room and theyre getting the same amount of money that we are
565522 if you cant clearly articulate what you do others wont take the time to figure it out
565523 this process is like dumping everything into a funnel and seeing the answer that comes out
565524 tell me whats on your mind give me whatever youve got
565525 we ended up having to upgrade our web sites hosting plan so it could accommodate that level of traffic
565526 a blog can help you establish your credibility and expertise and that is what encourages people to click and buy
565527 but it takes time achieve it you dont get instant high search engine rankings its a fallacy to think you blog and you sell
565528 i dont think i ever had a case that came to me because of my web site
565529 we coordinated it so that occasionally our blog and chriss blog are about the same issue but from different perspectives
565530 what happens when you order a suit for 4 000
565531 this is a watershed event that is going to affect business and technology for many years
565532 its a tool for people to discover businesses in a way they couldnt be discovered before
565533 all internet companies need a facebook strategy or a presence on facebook
565534 they make it a safe place for communication and for doing business
565535 we already have a thriving ecosystem of businesses built on the facebook platform
565536 were trying to help these real estate professionals connect to the facebook community
565537 our aim is getting more people involved in the shopstyle community
565538 starting this wednesday july 23rd millennium restaurant will no longer offer imported bottled mineral water we are very excited to introduce this system to the guests of our restaurant and hope you will enjoy san francisco tap water safer amp more delicious than ever a charge of 1 per seated guests affords an endless supply of fresh carbon amp uv filtered water served chilled room temperature or sparkling
565539 i call heaven and earth to witness against you today that i have set before you life and death the blessing and the curse so choose life in order that you may live you and your descendants
565540 in our quest to work directly with local artisanal farmers and purveyors to bring our customers the best food possible our restaurant violated some codes over the last several days the restaurant has been working diligently with the department of health to rectify these outstanding violations
565541 they never came back to us and when we went back there we found that they were still using the machine
565542 i think it allows the diner to taste more of the flavor that youre cooking
565543 when you braise a lamb shoulder youre allowing flavor to escape in steam or heat what sous vide does is trap the protein or the vegetable or the fruit in an environment where those flavors cant escape
565544 where on the screen i am invariably a sonofabitch in life i am a dear dear boy
565545 dear world i am leaving because i am bored i feel i have lived long enough i am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool good luck
565546 he just stood up so tall and swung his head around there like he was somebody
565547 when times are hard you have to find strength in the good lord above
565548 i went to church i went out to eat i sang songs to people at the old folks home i visited a friend whos in the hospital i went to the house and lay down on the couch i let papa go to the store and talk to his buddies without fussin and now im talking to one of my kids thats a pretty good day id say
565549 the good lord taught me how to be happy if im not happy its my own fault if youre happy youre going to make other people happy be a light
565550 remember to lock your car doors when youre out after dark
565551 follow your dreams dream big and dream good then follow them
565552 you have to be realistic i have nothing against this guy its nonsense
565553 behold he stands behind our wall he looks in from the windows he peers through the lattice
565554 his tank was the first in a convoy they took a direct hit two guys were wounded they got out but elisha and the commander
565555 i have kidney problems and i need to drink all the time there was this trip planned at the end of eighth grade that was
565556 he knew all the trails even where to find water for wading in june
565557 everyone else in the whole city was curled under a blanket drinking cocoa elisha called us up and said weve got to go out find an open pharmacy and bring medicine to a bunch of old folks in the neighborhood i was with him hes golani a select army unit he didnt take a coat or gloves we came back like walking snowmen with raw hands when we got to the door of that cranky skinny old lady on the fifth floor she laughed out loud
565558 sima says itll be really hard on her she so quiet holds it all in
565559 weve been to bridal salons all over she cant find anything you have no idea how much easier it is to be the mother of the boy
565560 ive been to the seamstress and shes making my gown in that antique pink we both liked youve bought a dress already havent you
565561 you know therell be so much to do later on better get that dress
565562 when i was a young father id come home from work about six and the kids would rush towards me
565563 see you are my enemy what are you doing here get out
565564 since i am already here let me stay and i will pay you for whatever i eat and drink
565565 then let me give you half the cost of the party
565566 since the rabbis were sitting there and did not stop him this shows that they agreed with him i will go and inform against them to the government
565567 and see whether they will offer it on the altar
565568 because of the scrupulousness of rabbi zechariah our house has been destroyed
565569 people will say that blemished animals are offered on the altar
565570 is one who makes a blemish on consecrated animals to be put to death
565571 because of the scrupulousness of rabbi zechariah ben abkulas our house has been destroyed our temple burnt and we ourselves exiled from our land
565572 repeat to me the verse of scripture you have learnt
565573 g d desires to lay waste his house and to lay the blame on me
565574 a storehouse of wheat requires the fuel of sixty stores of wood
565575 let us go out and make peace with the romans
565576 there is no fine flour but there is white flour
565577 there is no white flour but there is dark flour
565578 there is no dark flour but there is barley flour
565579 i will go out and see if i can find anything to eat
565580 the tender and delicate woman among you which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground
565581 how long are you going to carry on in this way and kill all the people with starvation
565582 what can i do if i say a word to them they will kill me
565583 devise some plan for me to escape the city perhaps i shall be able to save a little
565584 pretend to be ill and let everyone come to inquire about you bring something foul smelling and put it by you so that they will say you are dead let then your disciples carry your bed but no others so that they shall not notice that you are still light since it is known that a living being is lighter than a corpse
565585 peace to you o king peace to you o king
565586 your life is forfeit on two counts one because i am not a king and you call me king and again if i am a king why did you not come to me before now
565587 as for your saying that you are not a king in truth you are a king since if you were not a king jerusalem would not be delivered into your hand as it is written and lebanon a reference to the holy temple shall fall by a mighty one 5 as for your question why if you are a king i did not come to you till now the answer is that the biryoni among us did not let me
565588 if there is a jar of honey round which a serpent is wound would one not break the jar to get rid of the serpent
565589 g d turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolish
565590 arise for the emperor is dead and the notables of rome have decided to make you head
565591 do not worry the good news has done it as it is written good tidings make the bone fat
565592 seeing that you are so wise why did you not come to me till now
565593 i am now going and will send someone to take my place you can however make a request of me and i will grant it
565594 give me yavneh and its sages and the family chain of rabban gamaliel and physicians to heal rabbi zadok
565595 g d turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolish
565596 i cant because thats why i am chosen to be a king
565597 you have surrounded this mountain long enough turn away and take your journey
565598 everything that a worthy student will expound before his master
565599 was as difficult for the jewish people as the day when the golden calf was made because the torah cannot really be translated
565600 was g d angry for your sakes saying gad and part of the tribe of menasseh and moses message to his successor
565601 no man dies with even half his hearts desires fulfilled
565602 why cant i just snap back to my old self
565603 if you dont move your lungs and muscles will suffer
565604 although i want this pain to be over already the healing process is not within my control g d decides how long it will take my job is to trust g d and do good psalms 37 3 if i do my work he will heal me at the rate he thinks is best
565605 even though i fear that i will always feel broken and miserable i choose to make room in my heart for faith and gratitude even if i can only manage 1 at a time
565606 despite the pain i choose to accept my pain yet not be defined by it i am greater than this grief
565607 despite my stormy emotions i choose to face the inner turbulence with faith and tranquility knowing that i have within me all the healing resources i need to use this trauma for self transformation
565608 despite my fears of going insane and being trapped in sorrow i can at any given moment think a positive thought or do an act of kindness or self control which will reveal my inner strengths and build my sense of identity and self worth
565609 even though i dont understand why this happened and feel so distant from g d i choose to build my faith bit by bit 1 at a time trusting
565610 even though i am upset that im not getting all the love and understanding i want from people i choose to know that only g d can provide consistently reliable love and that he can fill me with love this second
565611 despite the pain and bitterness i choose to be grateful for the smallest goodness in my life i can look around whatever room i am in and think of the possessions i am grateful for or be grateful for every part of my body that is working or be grateful for any moment of pleasure no matter how empty and meaningless it seems in comparison to the enormity of my grief
565612 i dont really care enough about you or your issues to assist make change become involved so instead i righteously act as if i dont want to interfere
565613 its not talmud states that the temple was destroyed due to kamtza and bar kamtza the story of kamtza and bar kamtza is well known and goes like this
565614 bar kamtza was the individual who was in a serious dispute with the host yet kamtza the hosts friend appears entirely innocent kamtza wasnt even present at the affair so what role did he possibly play in this wrongdoing why does the talmud hold him accountable
565615 take an iron pan and place it upright as a wall of iron between you and the city and it will be as a siege a sign for the jewish people
565616 the holy city will be surrounded by a wall of iron slotted together of soldiers carrying swords and cloaked in shields return for metal is upon you prevent the wall of iron from breaking the walls of the city and of the temple
565617 iron was not mentioned here neither in relation to the sanctuary nor the temple because it is analogous of the people of 3 g ds aversion was stressed most with regard to the altar the primary vessel of the temple 4 for
565618 any sage who is not tough as iron is not a sage
565619 im so sad youre not in my life anymore i miss you can we reconnect
565620 the reflecting pool presents a story that i have not taken the time or courage to touch
565621 the film illustrates that as so often is the case the truth does not set you free it ties your stomach and conscience into knots it will remind you of all the presidents men and jfk films that also used drama to pursue political truths
565622 the script is top notch the characterizations moving if the film has a flaw its in trying to document so much evidence in a narrative thriller yet by and large it pulls it off to deliver a chilling and effective message maybe it can happen here
565623 most of all we wanted to tell a human story about what happens to people when the truth is kept from them and show the struggle one must go through for their own sense of integrity
565624 september 11th 2001 was a defining moment in modern history an event that propelled america toward preemptive wars under false pretenses resulting in the deaths of over a million civilians in the middle east thousands of american troops and a complete disregard for the geneva conventions not to mention the bill of rights
565625 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead and we are talking about attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomena but a phenomena that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st petersburg police and jena 6 and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
565626 i do not subscribe to the notion that the painfully slow response of fema and the department of homeland security was racially based the ineptitude was colorblind
565627 is influenced by our culture what we do what we see and what we think affect the scenery of the 21st century be it bad or good the powers of observation give us the resources to make a statement
565628 a couple years ago i did an ep under the moniker bowery boy blue and i played some shows around the city with it
565629 the project was a little dormant for a while and then i had this batch of songs last year and i went ahead and booked time at steve albinis studio electrical audio in chicago
565630 there are some references in the play to the furies who are sort of ringing around the protagonist
565631 its a real loose association i dont think anyone listening to the record needs to know anything about the play to get anything out of it
565632 made it vexingly difficult for e gold to expel a user in a truly effective way for criminal abuse of the system
565633 failure to transition from a marginal player for early adopters to a respected institution integrated into the global financial mainstream
565634 failure to emerge so far is a result of many factors but the root causes were design flaws in the account creation and provisioning logic that led to the unfortunate consequence of vulnerability to criminal abuse criminal abuse of the e gold system in turn led to a self reinforcing negative reputation
565635 i dont really know what is was just couldnt really find a rhythm with my mechanics i dont think anything was off but i just couldnt really find a rhythm couldnt feel comfortable and it was a grind to get through seven and mikey picked me up had a couple of great plays at third it always helps when the offense is going out there and putting up that amount of runs it takes pressure off you to be too fine you can just go attack guys and hopefully get quick innings
565636 its very important its not just me its all the starting pitchers guys have been throwing the ball really well this year with this offense you can go out and give up three four five sometimes six runs and you can go six seven innings and still get a win it definitely makes it a little bit easier to pitch for this team
565637 its frustrating but it was a bad pitch it was a hanging curveball he stayed back on it and hit it out id rather give up a home run on a pitch like that than a well executed pitch that a guy hits out
565638 its so nice to score early and put a crooked number up and then do it again and spread it out give ourselves some breathing room jon started without his best stuff and then gave up the 2 early threw the breaking ball to brown but we come right back and the he settled in and established down with that two seamer and got aggressive in the zone
565639 he made some great plays at third we have a quick turnaround when we spread it out we can get him out of there i dont know how much that will make him feel good for tomorrow nobody has ever questioned his toughness he wants to play every day he shows up to win and tonight was a great example of that
565640 tonight is a good example we got down early and jonny had to fight a little bit to find it and were fine lets go play our game because there had been some frustration thats part of baseball but how you handle that ism ore important and i think tonight was a very good example of lets just go play and see where we end up you dont always come back and score 5 runs but its a good way to play
565641 we really appreciate you coming out today folks drive home safely hey girls this is my grandson vernon hes 15 and single thanks for coming out we appreciate it
565642 mr mckinnon is charged with the biggest military computer hack of all time
565643 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
565644 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
565645 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
565646 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
565647 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
565648 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
565649 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
565650 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
565651 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist
565652 the holy fathers theology of the body and other philosophical and theological works delve deeply into the divinity of sexual relations in marriage im just making these complex ideas more accessible to average catholics
565653 the workshops with father knotz really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and guilt regarding sex
565654 he really listens to couples and this is why i think he understands us so well
565655 its a novel approach which in my experience helps couples achieve greater intimacy so why not
565656 there are no other international markets that need to be addressed in this manner
565657 i think what weve seen is that australia has a very sophisticated coffee culture
565658 people come in our cafe because they know us and they know theyll get good coffee were part of the local community
565659 starbucks is a mcdonalds coffee experience its not about the quality of the coffee its about convenience and location
565660 a few years ago there werent that many of them and they seemed to be going ok but then all of a sudden they were everywhere
565661 some city blocks had three starbucks on them its crazy
565662 what we do isnt rocket science im the first to admit that but youve got to have a passion for coffee that involves everything from grinding the beans to operating the machine
565663 you go into starbucks and its full of teenagers behind the counter id question whether they have that passion
565664 we may be using webcams and internet technologies but youre still trying to find that chemistry
565665 and if it isnt there you just move on to the next person
565666 if people decide they dont like someone they usually know within 30 seconds
565667 if you meet someone you like three minutes isnt long enough if you dont like them 30 seconds is too long
565668 if you see someone you like in real life you dont go up to them with your resume and compare you just talk
565669 i wanted to be a little ridiculous and put myself out there
565670 my mom said the more places you put your resume the better chance you have for finding a job i figured id do the same thing with dating
565671 eight to 10 percent of our users have been to real dating sites

565675 it was a clear cut case of murder we have got vital clues and i am hopeful of getting the culprit within the next two days

565684 wenn dies tats chlich so kommt und auf der anderen seite jemand wie ich aus der partei geschmissen wird dann ist das ein bild von dem ich kaum glaube dass es der spd zutr glich sein wird
565685 jedenfalls dann nicht wenn sie bei der bundestagswahl deutlich ber 30 prozent abschneiden will und das muss ihr ziel sein
565686 sollte frau ypsilanti einen erneuten anlauf starten sich mit den stimmen der linkspartei w hlen zu lassen w re dies f r die bundes spd ein himmelfahrtskommando herr steinmeier kann sich dann alle beteuerungen schenken es auf keinen fall mit rot rot gr n zu versuchen

565696 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
565697 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
565698 emergency contraception is a unique method of contraception which can prevent pregnancy in almost 90 percent of females after unprotected sex malhotra explains
565699 it gives them an opportunity to escape from the clutches of unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion which have a bearing on high maternal mortality rates in this part of the world
565700 safe effective and convenient form of contraception particularly for lactating and estrogen sensitive women have even proved disastrous in villages and remote areas owing to poor follow up medical services
565701 there are many environmental problems to tackle and we need to cooperate with all sectors in society everyone must act in harmony and with consistency to reach success
565702 at the present time every relevant organisation in thailand is apparently aware of the problem of global warming and climate change many projects have been initiated and implemented in government agencies and in the private sector however the approach is scattered and lacks harmony
565703 facts and information are needed to solve problems therefore the institute conducts intensive research and studies and just as important listens to local communities and other interested parties such as involved entrepreneurs as much as possible
565704 our people live in the communities to learn the problems of the locals and also are in contact with 30 local networks in the province
565705 the pollution problem has not been totally solved this will take time but at least all stakeholders are now joining hands to tackle the problem
565706 it is the best to have communities participating in fact finding and in depth research the locals then understand the situation better and the officials can learn of their concerns about negative impacts firsthand
565707 i am not for or against the project and the tei has not conducted any study on the proposed dam
565708 but every time flood or draught hits the area the project is raised by the government as a solution just as surely every time the locals rise up and strongly oppose and protest against it then the issue fades away only to be revived when another flood or drought strikes the area
565709 if the dam remains the governments solution to the problem in the future it will have enough information and data not only to explain it to those who will be affected but to help them avoid negatives consequences most important the fact finding and monitoring scheme must be conducted consistently and diligently
565710 early this year the cabinet approved our proposal that government agencies purchase only products with green labels during the period 2008 to 2011 the measure is designed to stimulate both demand and supply in the market
565711 the products which are certified with the green label are those which have minimal undesirable effects on the environment at the same time green label recipients use fewer natural resources than comparable products
565712 the manufacturing process consuming process and disposal process are all considered before the green label is given
565713 there is one rule we will not accept financial support from the government agencies or companies involved in environmental disputes we are helping to tackle be they between the state and the people industry and locals etc we have to be neutral

565730 this is a provision with astonishing reach and it was slipped into the bill just this week not only does it affect nearly every credit card transaction in america such as visa mastercard discover and american express but the bill specifically targets payment systems like ebays paypal amazon and google checkout that are used by many small online businesses the privacy implications for americas small businesses are breathtaking
565731 privacy groups like the center for democracy and technology and small business organizations like the nfib sharply criticized this idea when it first appeared earlier this year
565732 at a time when concerns about both identity theft and government spying are paramount congress wants to create a new honey pot of private data that includes social security numbers this bill reduces privacy across americas payment processing systems and treats every american small business or ebay power seller like a criminal on parole by requiring an unprecedented level of reporting to the federal government this outrageous idea is another reason to delay the housing bailout legislation so that senators and the public at large have time to examine its full implications
565733 two and a half years ago eff sued at amp t on behalf of its customers seeking to hold the telecom giant responsible for its craven complicity in the white houses illegal warrantless wiretapping program since then the phone companies and their allies in washington have spent tens of millions of dollars lobbying congress to grant them retroactive immunity they ran ridiculous fear mongering attack ads against any politician who dared to oppose them president bush threatened to veto any bill that allowed effs lawsuit to continue
565734 we need your help to take the fight to the next level were going to challenge congresss unconstitutional grant of immunity in our case against at amp t were going to fight for a congressional repeal of immunity in the next congress and were going to file a new lawsuit against the government challenging its warrantless surveillance practices past present and future
565735 the australian it website reported that ebay australia sent a
565736 the buy button is their weapon of choice and thats how they impose market discipline

565739 the kijiji unit of ebay a free classified ads service covering 13 countries online was introduced in the united states in late june and has already achieved modest success in some important markets including new york its vice president and general manager jacob aqraou said it would market itself far more aggressively in 2008 and was further refining its service in hopes of putting a dent in craigslists huge market share lead
565740 mr aqraou said kijiji was meant to appeal to consumers who were uncomfortable with craigslists laissez faire approach where ads for sofas and child care discussion boards are a click away from offers for sadomasochistic encounters and prostitutes
565741 and although mr aqraou said most of kijijis visitors had come from word of mouth referrals it has spent an undisclosed amount on ads including some aimed at people who searched online for craigslist related terms like craig newmark the companys founder kijiji also leaned on its parent company for marketing help sending 15 million to 20 million e mail messages to ebay users who fit the young family profile
565742 it will pull in a lot of groups that have been marginalized by the mainstream internet offerings
565743 its a perfect example of why kijiji will hurt craigslist more than anybody else
565744 it adds to what craigslist does without changing the underlying model of free classifieds

565825 if youd like to find out which variation encourages visitors to navigate deeper into your site from your landing page website optimizer lets you specify multiple conversion pages for a single test page in this case youre not concerned with the specific action that theyre taking so much as that theyre taking action and not leaving your site after viewing your landing page

565833 we believe that this ruling represents a loss not only for us but for consumers and small businesses selling online therefore we will appeal it is clear that ebay has become a focal point for certain brand owners desire to exact ever greater control over e commerce we view these decisions as a step backwards for the consumers and businesses whom we empower everyday
565834 the courts have come up with three different legal standards to be used in determining restraint of trade
565835 rule of reason is the traditional test and the one most often applied in antitrust cases
565836 every agreement concerning trade every regulation of trade restrains to bind to restrain is of their very essence the true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition

565840 nos vino bien descansar un par de d as ahora comenzaremos a pensar en el partido contra hurac n
565841 en la medida que podamos sumar minutos estos amistosos sirven hubo momentos en los que le quitamos la pelota a gimnasia y llevamos al partido al ritmo que m s nos conven a lamentablemente cuando est bamos haciendo los m ritos para conseguir el empate lleg ese desgraciado tercer gol que nos derrumb en lo an mico
565842 estoy molesto por los errores que estamos cometiendo para colmo no ligamos nada y nuestros rivales no desaprovechan las ocasiones
565843 este grupo est en condiciones de alcanzar el rendimiento que nos pide el t cnico en el segundo tiempo dimos muestras de eso ahora necesitamos alcanzar la regularidad necesaria para conseguir los resultados que todos esperamos
565844 lo que tenemos que entender es que a partir del pr ximo domingo esto no debe repetirse jugando por los puntos los errores siempre se pagan caro
565845 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
565846 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
565847 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
565848 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
565849 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
565850 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

565860 venimos todos los a os en las vacaciones de julio porque nos gusta el norte argentino en tucum n nos quedamos dos d as y de aqu nos vamos a las termas de r o hondo
565861 vine hace 37 a os la primera vez y claro encuentro muchos cambios
565862 ver lo bien que se conservan los edificios antiguos y como preservan la cultura me parece importante porque eso es lo que les da identidad
565863 acabamos de llegar as que las expectativas que tengo son las mejores lo poco que v me encant conoc el parque 9 de julio lleno de verde y de flores todo muy prolijo y limpio
565864 reci n estoy dando mi primera caminata pero puedo decir en comparaci n a salta que el centro de tucum n es mucho m s vistoso
565865 tucum n es una provincia maravillosa con un encanto especial quiz s sea por la paz que se siente aqu distinto de como es buenos aires
565866 vinimos s lo a pasar el d a pero me gustar a volver
565867 lo m s lindo fueron las vistas de san javier y el dique el cadillal
565868 fui docente durante 42 a os y reci n de jubilada conoc la casita de tucum n me result impactante entrar a la sala de jura de la independencia

565873 cantar es una expresi n del alma no es otra cosa que cantar al amor
565874 el gobierno debe entender que la situaci n es dif cil por la tremenda presi n fiscal y la gran inflaci n que afectan principalmente al asalariado tucum n no puede depender de lo que le mande o no la naci n porque tiene un presupuesto de 5 500 millones una recaudaci n propia de 105 millones por mes y una importante coparticipaci n federal hay plata para discutir la recomposici n salarial el problema es que en vez de redistribuir el ingreso en los trabajadores la voluntad pol tica es tener dividir entre hijos y entenados
565875 sus prioridades son tener tranquilos a sus amigos empresarios funcionarios y gremialistas genuflexos con prevendas y privilegios mientras estamos de rodilla ante la naci n
565876 estamos en presencia del nepotismo y del autoritarismo producto de la manera de manejar el poder que tiene el gobierno en ese sentido la asamblea rechaz por unanimidad las declaraciones del ministro de econom a jorge jim nez quien dijo que los estatales tucumanos reciben uno de los mejores m nimos salariales del pa s son expresiones descalificadoras y totalmente provocativas
565877 esto se dilata cada vez m s creemos que se est haciendo muy poco para que se esclarezca el crimen
565878 espero que los compa eros de trabajo de mi pap se sumen a nuestros reclamos no nos vamos a cansar de pedir justicia
565879 tem amos que los chicos tambi n hubieran sido asesinados pero haberlo confirmado fue el golpe m s fuerte de nuestras vidas
565880 no entiendo no me entra en la cabeza c mo se puede actuar con tanto salvajismo contra los chicos no lo puedo entender
565881 por este tipo de omisiones se pueden provocar hechos como el que lamentamos
565882 ya tuve una charla con el t cnico batista y con mis compa eros y se aclararon cosas algunas noticias que salieron publicadas no eran ciertas

565894 las relaciones entre juan antonio iniesta y enrique ortiz son excelentes y lo que me sorprende es que no haya comunicaci n entre aligesti n y alg n accionista del h rcules
565895 el alicante es un inquilino ejemplar el h rcules nunca puede tener queja de nosotros tenemos derecho a entrenar un d a en el rico p rez cuando jugamos en casa y muchas veces ni hac amos uso de ello y nos bamos a villafranqueza nosotros tenemos el mismo inter s que ellos en que el c sped est perfecto
565896 el h rcules lo utiliza muchas m s veces que nosotros pero lo entendemos de todas formas quiero que quede claro que nunca hemos roto el acuerdo e incluso hemos entrenado muchas menos veces que nos tocaba en el rico p rez
565897 cuando alquilas algo todo debe estar en perfecto estado y el rico p rez no cumple ni mucho menos esos requisitos por ejemplo aparecen goteras en el palco en el vestuario sin embargo ni siquiera hemos exigido nunca que lo arreglen
565898 ahora s que voy a ser el n mero uno y estoy muy muy feliz de serlo ser el n mero uno del mundo siempre es un regalo por todo el trabajo hecho anteriormente eso me satisface mucho pero para ser el n mero uno tienes que ganar roland garros wimbledon

565920 al ayuntamiento le interesa que la cam traiga a elche eventos culturales y se mantenga una sinergia con la actividad que ya acoge el gran teatro el proyecto a n no est presentado y no se descarta que en el mismo edificio vayan algunas oficinas de la cam de otra ndole pero en esencia nosotros y la cam estamos de acuerdo en que ese inmueble tenga una actividad cultural relevante
565921 la negociaci n est muy avanzada y pensamos que la cam se va a volcar en este proyecto la entidad ya ten a previsto invertir una gran cantidad de dinero en el proyecto de centro cultural que inicialmente se pens para el hort del xocolater
565922 desde hace tiempo la cam desea hacer un proyecto potente en elche y la nueva aula de cultura o centro cultural ser a un revulsivo para el centro de la ciudad y para dinamizar la actividad cultural el nuevo centro permitir ampliar la oferta de actividades en todos los mbitos y disciplinas art sticas as como en la formaci n adem s la recuperaci n de la entrada hist rica al gran teatro desde la glorieta es algo que ilusionar a los ilicitanos pensamos que este tema va a quedar definitivamente resuelto despu s del verano
565923 se analizar n con el instituto municipal de cultura ya que la idea es complementar actividades el gran teatro por ejemplo puede acoger una representaci n concreta y tiene una determinada capacidad el centro de la cam puede disponer de una sala de actuaciones m s peque a pero que resulte interesante para otro tipo de eventos
565924 this remarkable blockbuster shiraz has a superbly concentrated nose of licorice plum raisin and raspberry fruit bursting with spice blueberry and expresso flavours intermixed with toasty oak vanillan this brilliant wine finishes smoothly with an unctuous texture and fine silky tannins
565925 the property itself covers 14 acres so directional signs are really important
565926 its kind of hard to find your way around so a lot of thought went into figuring that out
565927 we have some really good hotels and all of them are very into the idea of looking sharp
565928 when you start looking tired people start to lose interest
565929 the revenues are way ahead that started when we had a promise of a renovation
565930 its not going to help tonight but in 2009 and beyond
565931 i think that hotels are really always in a position of having to look toward the future and also the competition
565932 the meeting groups are really what are going to put the cliff house in a position to survive long term
565933 you always want to have a guest feel at least as comfortable as they do in their own home
565934 and of course you want to be up todate with the general feel of the hotel
565935 the life span of a renovation is five to seven years
565936 most brands wont let you go more than seven years
565937 we do have groups when theyre here on a site visit they ask whats your construction schedule
565938 that tells them how up to date and on the ball the properties are
565939 the main reason santa is so jolly is because he knows where all the bad girls live
565940 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
565941 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
565942 we will expel all the persons of the south side staying in the mt kumgang tourist area we deem unnecessary
565943 we will take strong military counter actions against even the slightest hostile actions in the tourist resort in the area of mt kumgang and the area under the military control from now on
565944 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
565945 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
565946 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
565947 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
565948 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
565949 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
565950 difficult to negotiate an accord when unemployment is on the rise and the economy is weakening
565951 a 40 percent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
565952 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
565953 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
565954 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
565955 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems
565956 of course as a politician and with his term expiring next year he cannot not think about a general election
565957 i am working under the assumption that mr fukuda will of course be the one who will call the election
565958 i think fukuda picked aso to be secretary general with a view to transferring power before the lower house election if the cabinets popularity doesnt pick up
565959 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
565960 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
565961 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
565962 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
565963 this award in excellence has two short statements on it
565964 i hit the ball really badly on the back nine but it was very windy and quite difficult
565965 im glad todays over but its only the third round im not too far behind and there will be lots of birdies to be made tomorrow
565966 my swing didnt feel too good by the end but im still happy to be in there
565967 these 17 and 18 year old players really want to come in and make their mark and make a good impression so theyre just as hungry as guys that might have been playing for 10 years
565968 so were certainly not fooled by port playing kids that havent played or guys that havent played for a while
565969 you hear a fair bit about sides having bogie sides and sides that just seem to match up and play well against other sides
565970 and not only that i mean look at port adelaide theyve been a pretty handy team over the past decade really
565971 theyve won a premiership in there and been very close on a few other times so having said that i think theyve always been pretty close games pretty tight games
565972 toddy certainly creates a lot more leadership in the side and more creativity around the rucks and so on
565973 creates a file for each singlepic settings reduce the cpu load
565974 i come to the match not 100 per cent physically or mentally
565975 but its a important match so i still try my best
565976 theres still a long way to go it wont be the last time we lose and well win another game at some point as well
565977 the all blacks built pressure and didnt allow us to build any pressure
565978 they were very effective on the tackle line on the gain line very effective around the breakdown and as a consequence we werent able to get into the game
565979 they profited from some of that pressure that they built and its one of those days where you try and create momentum
565980 sometimes you look outside the square to do that and you just have a sense that nothings going to work
565981 its not one well look back on and reflect on with a lot of pride and that also probably reflected the way the game went
565982 en respuesta a una queja que interpuso el pan ante el instituto federal electoral por usar la frase presidente leg timo de m xico en una carta que se distribuy entre los ciudadanos para promover la consulta popular sobre el petr leo
565983 andr s manuel l pez obrador solicit a los representantes del frente amplio progresista que presenten una denuncia ante el propio ife en contra de felipe calder n porque se ostenta como presidente de m xico si se rob la presidencia de la rep blica y porque ahora quiere robarse el petr leo

565988 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
565989 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
565990 but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
565991 based on the preliminary report the mv overturned after being hit by huge waves but we will continue to investigate the accident because we dont rule out the possibility it was caused by overload
565992 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked

566001 well duh high ground clearance good off road tips over easily way to state the obvious frickin rocket scientists
566002 anything with children is difficult most of us are parents or have children or families so it hits us a little bit
566003 the whole liberian community is coming everybody coming to pay their respect
566004 the most important thing i think is its really brought us together these four blocks
566005 they would just operate in marauding groups i guess i would say of between 10 and 15
566006 theyd be walking down the sidewalk and if you were coming their way you could not they would you had to step aside
566007 they would vandalize and wed try to put things back and then it would a couple days later maybe the same thing would happen again
566008 i think youd find a lot of kids that arent getting any supervision at home that have got a lot of problems of their own and they join up with other kids
566009 we actually were able to have the kids interacting with the residents and the community in a respectful way
566010 by revoking my jerusalem id they have revoked all the rights i have in palestine as well as my sons
566011 there is an ongoing and widely documented policy of discrimination in planning and building land expropriation home demolition the whole issue of revoking residency
566012 we believe in a jewish majority in jerusalem as such it is the capital of the jewish nation
566013 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
566014 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
566015 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
566016 these guys arent making any money maybe 35 bucks a night
566017 even in the heyday of st louis wrestling the south broadway athletic club was the rookie league a league tops sometimes dropping as low as beer league softball compared to major league baseball
566018 when we tell him that im going to a show he constantly asks is daddy going to get bloody
566019 im trying to explain to him that what daddy does in the ring is a job its a show its work you know dont go out and find a barbed wire fence and throw your friends into it
566020 lightfoots not just about wrestling hes about standing up for what you believe in
566021 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
566022 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
566023 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
566024 digital media can be very compelling and powerful evidence it can even be overwhelming in the right circumstances
566025 thats the world we live in thats a fact of life everybody has a camera
566026 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
566027 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
566028 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
566029 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
566030 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
566031 if we come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise where i have to accept some things that i dont like in order to get energy independence thats something i will have to consider
566032 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
566033 this is not about khrushchev or stalin its about the future of russia
566034 the reason these rumors persist is rooted in the fate of the country when reformers are consideredto be weak and tyrants strong
566035 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
566036 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
566037 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
566038 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
566039 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
566040 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
566041 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
566042 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
566043 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
566044 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
566045 im confident that by showing respect to the people to the olympics it will put me in a position to continue to have frank and candid discussions
566046 this is an enormous show of face gesture of face from the president to actually go to the olympics
566047 this is chinas international coming out party in many respects the olympics so its an enormous thing
566048 if this man is going as the leader of the free world to one of the most notorious rights abusing regimes in the world and he spends the whole afternoon watching water polo what does that say about where the united states priorities lie
566049 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
566050 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
566051 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
566052 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
566053 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
566054 its driven by the communication technology that each generation has grown up with
566055 its just natural for them they dont realize that its perceived to be disrespectful
566056 occasionally on accident i throw one in an e mail at work
566057 we dont feel emoticons have a place in any formal communications
566058 should sit down at their computer in a thoughtful way and do it not while theyre on their way somewhere
566059 you dont even have time to digest the meeting and youre getting a thank you note
566060 im not his friend im not even his employer i was somebody who interviewed him
566061 it is almost as bad as 2003 when sars broke out
566062 many foreigners canceled their trips or didnt bother to come
566063 weve tried to make sure our logistics providers all have those green trucks but were trying to be flexible
566064 we have a little bit more inventory than we did in the second quarter just in case
566065 the supply of some raw materials was indeed affected by restrictions during the olympics

566099 antes se sab a de la existencia de las luces durante un terremoto pero se desconoc a qu las originaba ahora con esta relaci n matem tica hay prueba evidente de una relaci n directa entre las ondas s smicas con las luces del terremoto lo que confirma que los destellos son provocados por el movimiento s smico
566100 esa filmaci n explic permiti contar por primera vez en el mundo con un registro de video hay informes que se alan que hace 2 000 a os en grecia se apreciaron las primeras luces pero s lo exist an como prueba unos dibujos ya en 1960 en jap n se apreciaron las primeras fotograf as

566103 lo tomamos con tranquilidad porque sab amos que no era algo que lo ten amos que resolver nosotros aunque s quer amos que se tomara una decisi n para la tranquilidad de leo y de todo el equipo ten amos que tener todos una soluci n
566104 sab a bien lo que quer a y si no se vio llegar antes fue porque mi club y la afa me dijeron que me mantuviera al margen creo que hice lo que ten a que hacer
566105 las cosas que hab an salido en la prensa argentina no eran ciertas que yo quer a estar ac con ellos que no pude hacer nada para estar antes y nada m s
566106 hubo mucha repercusi n en este tema especialmente en argentina
566107 es entendible la situaci n de leo que debe de haber sido un poco dif cil
566108 el bar a tiene jugadores y calidad como para sacar cualquier partido adelante sin leo pero bueno tom esa postura de querer retenerlo y despu s ya hubo que recurrir a la fifa y tuvieron que tomar una decisi n
566109 la pel cula tuvo un final feliz que pudimos contar con l
566110 es bueno porque sabemos que tenemos una ventaja con l
566111 nosotros nos mantenemos firmes con la realizaci n de nuestro programa excluyendo al presidente por no haber cumplido un pedido m nimo
566112 sab amos que ser a dif cil fichar a cristiano ronaldo el club trabaja muy duro para encontrar una soluci n a este caso vamos a ver lo que pasa no ser f cil hacerle venir si pregunt is a cualquier entrenador del mundo si quiere a ronaldo os responder que s es un grand simo jugador
566113 muchos clubes est n interesados por l pero creo que sabe que es un jugador importante en nuestro proyecto es un jugador fundamental para nosotors y no hemos pensando nunca en dejarle marchar
566114 no soy yo quien tiene que valorar c mo est n las negociaciones lo nico que puedo decir es que como futbolista no tenemos ninguna duda el resto son detalles del club que est trabajando y hay que ver c mo termina esto y hasta d nde llega
566115 sab amos desde el principio que iba a ser un tema complicado que no iba a ser f cil que un jugador como cristiano llegase al real madrid
566116 si le preguntas a todos los entrenadores todos te dir n que lo quieren es un jugador que todo t cnico quiere tener en su equipo un gran jugador con la exigencia del real madrid de ganar todo cada a o necesita a los mejores
566117 hay un inter s por este jugador pero no s si est firmado no tengo esa informaci n todav a
566118 he hablado con l y sabe perfectamente que es una parte importante de nuestro proyecto es un jugador fundamental no estamos pensando en ning n momento que se puede ir est trabajando hoy ha jugado sus primeros minutos en los que se ha visto lo que es robinho me parece perfecto que muchos est n interesados
566119 personalmente me habr a gustado que jugase en un primera en espa a hab a posibilidades pero hay que aceptar la decisi n del jugador sin duda el futbol ingl s es tambi n una escuela importante para los j venes espero que avance y mejore en muchas cosas
566120 todav a nos cuesta coger un ritmo bueno durante muchos minutos del partido pero tenemos calidad para decidir hay que sufrir ante equipos m s rodados como el hamburgo que en dos semanas empieza su liga y se nota

566142 greatest pleasure is to serve the lord in his poor children rejected by other people
566143 what i need you to do is to stop thinking about going somewhere else
566144 es un orgullo haber sido parte de los patriotas por 16 temporadas este sentimiento siempre se lleva dentro y ahora ser un patriota por siempre

566147 pension reform can be politically difficult but the experience of the oecd countries over the past 10 15 years suggests that obstacles to pension reform are not insuperable more than half of oecd countries have had major changes over that time
566148 france germany and sweden for example are projected to slow or even reverse the growth in public pension spending
566149 now poverty rates for older people are lower than for the population as a whole in all but seven oecd countries
566150 the pension reform laggards should take heart from the reforms of other nations and press ahead with necessary changes to the retirement income system
566151 you will find it not mysterious when you have become familiar with it it will not be as mysterious as before
566152 is a dream of china a china that probably never existed except in my boyhood fantasies
566153 you think you know china take a hit of this
566154 the school is empty now but you can close your eyes and hear the sounds and see the kids
566155 back when i started in education in 1981 you just go into a school building and everything is there
566156 this is a brand new building there arent staplers that automatically come with the school
566157 of course itll be a rainy day and a student in white pants will slide down the hill and itll be muddy
566158 shell want to go home and change and will not accept the fact that a parent will bring a change of clothes
566159 we want something at the best quality at the best price
566160 its time we have more of a college setting and thats why i like the tables and chairs instead of student desks
566161 to see it go from something that was so negative to something so positive now
566162 the idea of contemporary sculpture is to form your own opinion if you dont understand it you can make up something
566163 theres always a surprise around every corner you can come four times a year and always see something different
566164 an aberrant event does not equate as proof of something other than the reality that people can do bad things to other people for any manner of reasons or delusions or both
566165 so while the internet hums with talk of the event and what it means on so many levels of experiences i can best offer only my deepest sympathies and condolences to all involved in this tragedy i hope you take a moment to send them your best thoughts as well
566166 in the coming weeks we will learn more about the perpetrator his background and his motives it wont change what happened though and theres no explaining such cowardly acts of violence and it wont bring back the victims or take away the emotional scars
566167 but what will long be remembered after the perpetrators name is forgotten is the heroism of the church congregation and particularly that of greg mckendry who by all accounts lived his life as a caring helping hero right up until his final moments
566168 our thoughts are with the families of the victims and everyone affected by this senseless tragedy and especially the children
566169 i try to pretend the killer is someone i love and care about i search myself for pity or compassion and find none the members of the church he attacked will forgive him long before i do that makes me hateful too i dont want this hate inside of me the hate inside of me is my responsibility and not his that doesnt make me any less angry with him
566170 bloggers are pondering whos to blame for the tragedy at a knoxville church sunday when will both the left and right wake up from their partisan stupor and realize that crazy murderers arent exactly the best examples of why the other side is wrong
566171 only on the interweb could you find such a group of people arguing with each other
566172 i told them when you go back to germany youre going to have to explain where volkswagen is going to go in the united states and if you say chattanooga theyre going to know what youre talking about
566173 he told me bob i had no idea that this is the way that chattanooga was
566174 they took us aside and said that is a very difficult site
566175 i guess we would have had to plant a lot of strawberries
566176 i have always said that ultimately it would be based on something intangible something in our gut or maybe better in our hearts
566177 to see the green spaces and to see the recreation and to see the diversity in the economy and what chattanooga did under the local leadership i will tell you impressed them on every visit
566178 manufacturing is the soul of this city but we have also worked to clean up our town as much as any city in america
566179 if i want x i tend to ask for x but i found them to be very straightforward in that way it was a good match of personalities
566180 what we have to do is say we cant do that but we can do the improvements so we need to be talking about the design of the site
566181 if there were any sort of touchy steps along the way i think it was when we got through putting together all the incentive packages
566182 i think it looked to them weak and difficult to understand compared to what the other states were doing we had to do a lot of education
566183 the only way i had to get out was a satellite phone
566184 at least i had a great view of the ocean while i worked
566185 we stayed focused on what we needed to do and tried to remain positive even when reports from automobilwoche newsletter southern business and development magazine and others said vw was going to huntsville
566186 as we look out across those spectacular mountains and that river and enjoy the warm welcome of the people of tennessee the intangibles are suddenly very tangible
566187 i think the volkswagen decision was made 30 years ago when chattanooga decided it was a city of exceptional attributes and decided to celebrate them and emphasize them
566188 now when you come to chattanooga its a totally different looking place its a city with a lot of confidence the volkswagen decision is a tremendous validation of all the work chattanooga has done in the last 30 years
566189 get in the car turn up the music check out your old neighborhood haunts
566190 his suggestion does not fit with any other program other than the one already being used
566191 no person other than the sales manager has dealt with that client
566192 powell caught this fish and honestly neither one of us really knew what it was
566193 i hated to beat his record so i let him file his paperwork so he could get his state record certificate
566194 that way he can always say he had the state record
566195 weve been known to use a boat to get to some areas but we wade the shoals and drift through the deeper holes
566196 all i do now is just fish at every opportunity i get
566197 i just slowed down a little bit and let her play more aggressive it was my mistake to let her back into the match
566198 mmmm impressive but no thanks i already have a sharpie
566199 we wanted to break the format and do something different particularly after how powerful the climax was with the death of two major characters
566200 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
566201 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
566202 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
566203 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
566204 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
566205 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead
566206 its a big show for bbc america and its a show they are really proud of and it works really well i dont exactly know what that means in physical numbers but it gets a lot of airtime and it gets a lot of coverage
566207 i realize that most journalists detest freedom service loyalty and sacrifice characteristics of conservatives far more than of liberals
566208 to include this in the article is nothing but an attempt to tie conservatives particularly popular conservatives to the murders committed by adkisson
566209 youre not special youre not powerful youre not connected youre not clever youre not important
566210 i see a globe of white quivering floating over a sea of wheat
566211 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
566212 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
566213 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
566214 difficult to negotiate an accord when unemployment is on the rise and the economy is weakening
566215 a 40 percent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
566216 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
566217 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
566218 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
566219 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems
566220 its certainly a black eye for the industry but unfortunately altercations on the field are part of the game
566221 it certainly wont deter me from continuing to go to minor league baseball games
566222 i think its just good baseball at its purest form
566223 i dont think the sport of baseball can mandate cultural behavior but i think baseball does a wonderful job of setting a good example by and large day in and day out
566224 i think its important to be very punitive in terms of disciplinary measures if anything happens that takes away from that aspect of minor league baseball
566225 payag ho ako provided na pareho i agree provided that we both undergo the test but it must be a conducted by a reputable or competent foreign agency
566226 ito hong si justice sabio hes supposed to be a learned lawyer as a matter of fact he is a professor of law he knows that a lie detector test is inadmissible ho sa korte that being the case kung hindi admissible sa korte bakit nya ho prino propose
566227 ibig sabihin gusto niya ho in the court of public opinion hindi ho ba yong being a justice nasa husgado ho siya dapat all things should be tried not in the court of public opinion but sa husgado
566228 sadly most websites do not have those primary things right
566229 the idea of community user generated content and more dynamic web pages are not inherently bad in the same way they should be secondary to the primary things sites should get right
566230 the main criticism or problem is that i do not think these things are as useful as the primary things
566231 most people just want to get in get it and get out
566232 for them the web is not a goal in itself it is a tool
566233 its because they are 20 years old that they act differently to 40 year olds

566239 this decision is an insult to all police officers and is nothing more than a green light for those evil thugs who have a complete disregard for life itself and think nothing of killing a police officer
566240 granting an evil calculated killer any kind of dispensation is criminal and leaves the judiciary with blood on its hands
566241 i urge you to do whatever is needed to reverse this travesty of justice
566242 this is shockingly disrespectful to his memory and illustrates the utter travesty of our criminal justice system where the rights of a cop killer outweigh the rights of a fallen officers family friends and colleagues

566260 theres been a history of lots of discourtesy toward folks who bike and lots of impatience
566261 we just have to feel a responsibility for each other and when we cause harm and injury we have to believe its our responsibility to stop and help and not spin off
566262 theres probably a population of folks who believe that bikes dont belong on the streets they belong on the sidewalks
566263 ive had just about everything thrown at me and just about everything yelled at me over the course of 25 years
566264 i had someone one day stop and come over and knock the bike out from under me throwing me on the road
566265 i just got up and said i can see youre very angry

566297 every mystery solved brings us to the threshold of a greater one
566298 your purdue education has helped you become ready for the world of the 21st century a century filled with large global challenges ones that cry out for smart changes not just in technology but in thinking
566299 look to your left look to your right you may be sitting next to a future ceo a future teacher doctor or college president one thing we know for certain you will be the change agents of the 21st century
566300 these should not be goals only on our college campuses but should be standards that we hold ourselves to throughout our lives
566301 while ive talked about change we all know that some things never change like the relationship of hard work to success the importance of friends and family to our well being and the desire and need to share ourselves with others
566302 i welcome you its good to have you back again you were missed while you were gone as for your dearest family theyll be here later on i need you badly youre part of my plan theres so much more that we have to do to help our mortal man

566307 because new hampshire depends on these flows of people in their 30s and 40s to new hampshire if the housing market is bogged down its people like these who wouldnt come
566308 rockingham and hillsborough residents are the highest paid because they are the most competitive with massachusetts businesses they also have the most businesses there
566309 were growing faster than any other state in the region but its a race among turtles
566310 you cant tell me that young adults are not leaving the state
566311 housing is more affordable for young people in other states
566312 i think the state should be quite concerned because i think its losing working age people
566313 the communities shun affordable workforce housing because they think it will increase the school population and increase their taxes
566314 look at what wally tiernan hit with his car approximately 16 miles east of greenwood s c a landowner believes this is the same lion he had seen a week earlier dragging a 320 lb steer out of the pasture this lion weighed 260 lbs
566315 for some reason a lot of people think that if you get it off the internet its got to be true
566316 he cast his 7 foot spinning rod and okuma reel with 25 pound line the chug bug lure a four inch lure with three small hooks snagged the mans shirt near the shoulder
566317 he had a pretty good hook on him and was slowly reeling him in when the officer arrived
566318 track 3 in the album its quite unique you can feel the atmosphere of the desert and has a hope no matter where you are in through this song maybe youll think im insane and crazy on it but for those christians sure agreed what i am saying now its a good try to listen this album
566319 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
566320 advisers simply cannot tell investors they are going to do one thing with their funds and then not follow through on those promises
566321 people are working today because they simply dont have enough income to retire its as simple as that
566322 they are panicking and looking at their savings and not seeing that that would get them through
566323 its really difficult at this time to pinpoint any correlation between the downturn in the economy and whether that affects people to work past retirement there could be a lot of reasons why people do what they do after retirement age
566324 if you can hire a bright eyed bushy tailed recent college graduate versus somebody who is older you know where human nature leads you on that
566325 there was no dissent over whether there should be a stimulus
566326 just over whether it should be 50 billion or a lot bigger theres real consensus that the economy has structural problems ranging from people like reich and me to ceos who look at the markets and say we really need better rules
566327 people need to be confident that the next president will help create jobs that will actually enable families to keep up with rising prices
566328 what do you think this just didnt happen by accident
566329 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
566330 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
566331 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
566332 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
566333 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
566334 im looking forward to the whole olympic experience from the opening ceremonies to the competition ive waited a long time to do this
566335 its not an event you need a ticket for which is really neat
566336 it will probably have a similar feel to the boston marathon
566337 i feel very blessed that my body has held up and that i feel as good as i ever have
566338 its a great reward to have it happen for me in an olympic year
566339 he said the food is great the hotel is great and practice is going good
566340 if i execute at this olympic games the way i can and should and will i dont believe theres anybody in the world that can beat me
566341 give me a couple of minutes and ill probably shoot up out of this chair and yell i made it this is quite an experience for me
566342 to me its common sense its a conflict of interest
566343 were not married were not civil unioned were not in any way legally binded
566344 there would be no direct financial gain to me for voting for wadleigh starr amp peters in any way
566345 i suspect over the years he may have done some research or covered some items for the district
566346 but id have to look back into my records to tell
566347 in which the official or a member of the officials immediate family has a direct personal or financial interest
566348 every opportunity arthur gets to put pressure on wadleigh one way or the other he does hes not objective at all
566349 such a statement is woefully inaccurate and fails to recognize that manchester is a city that has turned the corner and is on the road to recovery and renaissance
566350 given his lack of leadership on fighting crime its interesting to hear mayor guinta criticize a superior court judge for recognizing the problems plaguing manchesters neighborhoods
566351 should immediately be processed through the register with a receipt
566352 no cash should be held on anyones desk for any purpose
566353 drivers have the concern that if this is allowed then we may see an expansion of this activity to the point we are providing adult day care
566354 we cut our driveway out but were over our heads
566355 were hoping to get the best possible deal as a town
566356 theres overwhelming devastation but theres also the amazing resilience of the people
566357 is done in a matter of days and not weeks sen gregg and i will push to see that happen
566358 we are fine and stable for us it is simply the cleanup but the cleanup is very daunting
566359 because you did not feel this road got enough attention
566360 being a canadian kid growing up in canada having my friends and family there you couldnt ask for a better script for my first start
566361 i had to check my nerves at the door you know ive been playing this game for a long time and just tried to keep things simple i wasnt going to worry about who was in the batters box
566362 i gave a little hat tip to the fans because i wanted them to know how much i appreciated that it felt so good id like to rewind that moment and do it every day
566363 im happy for richmond its an opportunity to pitch in the big leagues and hopefully hell stay here and have a super career
566364 the timing from our perspective is really tough he was the front end of our rotation and a guy that were not going to be able to replace
566365 i dont have a choice in the matter id love to pitch in the olympics but its also been my dream to play major league baseball its very hard to get here im just very excited and trying to take advantage of this opportunity and stay as long as i can
566366 i remember thinking if i get hit im going to die
566367 and i thought i cant do this to them i cant die
566368 stationary vehicles displaying blue red or amber emergency or warning lights
566369 theyre just trying to create a wider berth and increase the sensitivity and awareness
566370 all types of emergency type personnel have been getting killed on the side of the road for the past few years and this is an attempt to make people move over so they dont hit the people when theyre doing their job
566371 while they were either on traffic stops or protecting the scene of an accident or incident on the highway
566372 i remember seeing the front end of this dark vehicle coming at my chest
566373 id already been launched through the air and didnt realize it
566374 if he ever hit me direct id either still be in the hospital or id be dead
566375 its about everyone else out there that hopefully this never happens to
566376 if people would just slow down and move over itll make things a whole lot safer for everyone involved
566377 if there are two or more lanes move over a lane to give them a better corridor of safety if its just a two lane road then please just slow down so nothing tragic happens
566378 i wont approach it on the drivers side i always go on the passenger side
566379 gas is killing me right now all the money that the past three summers i would have been saving to buy my books for school at the beginning of the college semester is now going directly into my gas tank
566380 i have pretty much given up any hope of going back to school with any amount of money past what my most recent paycheck has given me not to mention that i also work a part time job in manchester two days a week which is making my gas bill that much more
566381 gas should not be affecting me this much as i drive two of the most fuel efficient vehicles there are a motorcycle and a four cylinder ford focus when is it going to end
566382 i had planned to retire in less than three years
566383 due to the high cost to get to and from my job i am not able to save as originally planned unfortunately public transportation or carpooling are not options that i can take advantage of so i am forced to look at costs ranging close to 700 a month
566384 i have decreased my driving speed from 80 miles per hour to 65 miles per hour which has increased my commute time by 10 minutes each way
566385 i have just started this and am not sure if it has helped with the miles per gallon enough that it outweighs the extra time added to my commute
566386 we have communicated with our business services office so that they are aware of the mefa situation and im certain they will be accommodating
566387 the only families that would have difficulty would be the ones who have poor credit
566388 what im hearing is anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of those students may not have access to some of those loans that they may not qualify
566389 stepping up to the plate with more aggressive financial aid packages
566390 thats really the big piece of this ten years ago if you were trying to sell someone saving the earth youd get a boot in the butt but now weve proved theres viability and payback
566391 we dont have to handle the hot grease it goes right into our holding tank downstairs and right into our boiler
566392 this burner will burn all of these and burn them in the same tank

566401 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
566402 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment
566403 this is an intriguing contribution to efforts aimed at identifying the molecular bases of alcohol tolerance
566404 there is currently no effective medical treatment for children with the most common type of congenital hyperinsulinism this type of congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that encode important potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells
566405 using novel techniques we have identified a key membrane protein thats essential to the defense that m tuberculosis mounts against the acidic environment of immune cells called macrophages
566406 without this protein called rv3671c the bacterium becomes vulnerable to acidification and is killed
566407 m tuberculosis does not depend on rv3671c under standard growth conditions in the test tube so it has been overlooked as a candidate drug target
566408 however when m tuberculosis infects the host then the rv3671c protein becomes essential
566409 this is an example of a new class of potential targets for anti infective agents
566410 those that the pathogen only needs in order to survive in the host environment
566411 threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf region
566412 capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations and its own people
566413 hes caused the death of thousands of dead soldiers because hes mismanaged the war
566414 hes got us involved in a war that shouldnt have involved us because there was no direct threat
566415 osama is a bad man because he didnt like freedom
566416 i think younger workers first of all younger workers have been promised benefits the government promises that have been promised benefits that we cant keep thats just the way it is
566417 our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we they never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we
566418 the relations with uhh europe are important relations and theyve uhh because we do share values and theyre universal values theyre not american values or you know european values theyre universal values and those values uhh being universal ought to be applied everywhere
566419 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
566420 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
566421 i know how hard it is for you to put food on your family
566422 i hear theres rumors on the internets that were going to have a draft
566423 you teach a child to read and he or her will be able to pass a literacy test
566424 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practice their love with women all across this country
566425 theres an old saying in tennessee i know its in texas probably in tennessee that says fool me once shame on shame on you fool me you cant get fooled again
566426 i know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully
566427 the duty of state government is to serve and protect people our first job is making sure we are serving the public and are available to the public the state director of personnel is currently reviewing telecommuting policies with that goal in mind and we would consider any proposals for a four day week in the same vein
566428 telecommuting for some state agencies might work well but supervising such an arrangement would take a special level of skills and development of standards to avoid abuse of such a system
566429 the pluses are that we save fuel costs with people staying either at home or in one location the supervisors will need to provide strong oversight to prevent abuse we must be careful which services we are doing this with and not lose the personal touch for our citizens
566430 as governor i will veto any income or sales tax fees are appropriate for special services but should be kept at a minimum necessary to provide the services
566431 i think we need to have a broad based fair based tax on all new hampshire residents that would be dedicated solely to paying public education costs in our school districts such a tax would likely be an income tax and could have a sunset provision of two or four years
566432 i do not support increasing any taxes or new taxes the people cannot afford it they are already being spent out of their homes i only support administrative fees as far as it goes to cover the costs of the existing program
566433 with the slowdown in the national economy we will continue to make the tough choices necessary to ensure we are balancing the budget providing services to our most vulnerable citizens and making smart choices for the future to create jobs improve education expand access to health care and improve our roads and infrastructure
566434 i oppose cutting back on human services dropout prevention tobacco hazard education and physical access building codes for private and public buildings would be programs i would like to see furthered with a little extra money
566435 my top three priorities in terms of agencies would be safety health and human services and transportation this is not the time for a new program nor is it the time to expand a program we should be concentrating on helping the taxpayer and hoping to maintain what we have
566436 its unfortunate that we have to take these steps particularly when our newspaper circulation is growing
566437 unfortunately revenue has not kept pace and were now facing the same cutbacks that so many other news organizations have already experienced
566438 right now i dont really know that much about all the cars
566439 the british make some really dependable cars and theyll run forever if you take care of them
566440 if you think charging people 391 percent interest is a good thing youre probably working for the payday lending industry theyre the only ones who think its a good idea
566441 its a drain on the economy its bad for consumers ohio doesnt need this especially right now
566442 its providing another opportunity for our customers to have some fun
566443 start punishing and locking up the business owners who hire these people
566444 im not talking about fining em 1 000 im talking about taking assets in millions youd only have to do a few theyd get the message
566445 paramount importance to study the roots of terrorism and other forms of violence
566446 deeply concerned that funding such research through the pentagon may pose a potential conflict of interest
566447 elements of national power beyond the guns and steel of the military
566448 in iraq and afghanistan the heroic efforts and best intentions of our men and women in uniform have at times been undercut by a lack of knowledge of the culture and people they are dealing with every day
566449 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
566450 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
566451 its harder to find a job its harder to sell houses its a scary time

566464 puede que sea un poco tarde y que latinoam rica haya estado algo olvidada en anteriores ocasiones pero por fin ha llegado su momento y estamos muy contentos de que m xico albergue esta gran cita
566465 lo m s llamativo en latinoam rica es que la mayor a de la gente no entiende que el vih es una infecci n viral no moral el estigma y la discriminaci n que existen todav a obstaculizan los esfuerzos para luchar contra la epidemia
566466 las buenas intenciones no son suficientes y se deben crear verdaderas pol ticas p blicas que funcionen y permitan la atenci n y prevenci n del vih
566467 los gobiernos han hecho poco para cumplir con sus reiteradas promesas de terminar con las violaciones de derechos de las personas que viven con vih y de quienes est n expuestos a un alto riesgo de infecci n
566468 la educaci n de m s m dicos en el tratamiento de la enfermedad se ha convertido en un reto fundamental ya que muchos especialistas no quieren atender a las personas infectadas por vih por el estigma que les rodea y el miedo a contagiarse
566469 han olvidado que los cuidados m dicos y la prevenci n son igual de importantes que el acceso al tratamiento
566470 un creciente problema en la regi n es que muchos hombres que tienen sexo con otros varones tambi n mantienen relaciones con mujeres lo que est contribuyendo a la r pida propagaci n del virus entre el sexo femenino

566483 we expect the company will achieve tremendous success from the upcoming metallica expansion pack which will likely attach 20 percent of the installed base implying nearly 5 million units or 250 million in sales
566484 we expect the company will release at least 3 expansion packs for guitar hero iv before the next iteration of the franchise
566485 could be an over engineered product for the mass market
566486 we were receiving a lot of comments and feedback from membership around the country saying they were concerned about violent and sexually explicit video games getting in the hands of kids
566487 we also wanted to verify the report released by the federal trade commission their report showed improvement but we wanted to get an update on this study
566488 when that error occurs we want to follow up and correct it by contacting management at the store level and providing additional training for that store
566489 we are very sorry that employees sold mature video games to minors
566490 we will definitely speak to management at the stores and take appropriate actions i hope this renewed attention to the rating system will remind parents of the importance of monitoring the products their children are purchasing
566491 we hope that this reminds retailers to take the rating system seriously
566492 these results show the need for legislation that makes these voluntary regulations law we want parents to also be aware and we hope these efforts will make parents think about whether or not these games that involve people urinating on others and running over prostitutes in cars are appropriate for a 12 year old
566493 lady do you have any idea how many kids we have in here every day buying games do you think we have the time to look at each and every purchase
566494 any failure rate is problematic but the failure rate were seeing is downright pathetic
566495 similar to age restrictions on alcohol tobacco pornography and other products that are potentially harmful to children parents deserve a reasonable expectation that age restrictions for adult entertainment products will be enforced at the retail level
566496 it is outrageous that retailers are not exercising greater responsibility and even more absurd that there are no meaningful consequences for those retailers who ignore their industrys own age restriction policies
566497 countless independent studies confirm that repeated exposure to graphic sexual violent and profanity laced video games has a harmful and long term effect on children
566498 it is high time for retailers to follow the video game industry guidelines and check ids so that children will not be able to purchase m rated video games
566499 perhaps the retailers felt the pressure was off after the ftcs report was published but frankly either rate of failure is wholly unacceptable
566500 we encourage concerned citizens to contact their congressional representatives to ensure that the video game industry will become more responsible
566501 americas children need to be protected from harmful exposure to these products and parents should be able to rely on the industrys promises
566502 content in the future will come from many sources including digital downloads and from christian and secular outlets
566503 the data provide a distinct image of each faith group
566504 evangelicals are intensely driven by their faith their life is substantially influenced by their beliefs and their lifestyle choices and aspirations reflect the centrality of their spirituality
566505 non evangelical born again adults consider faith to be important but it is not the defining aspect of their existence it is influential but not the determining factor
566506 notional christians treat faith as just one of many dimensions of their life that serves a purpose but it is not a driving force at all
566507 skeptics have replaced faith with a passion for healthy longevity and personal pleasure gained through world travel sexual experiences and obtaining knowledge
566508 they are substantially less focused on relationships and legacy than are other groups they tend to be less concerned about finding or pursuing a purpose in life because a majority of them believe life has no purpose beyond comfort and pleasure
566509 and then there are the 80 percent or so who are at every other conceivable point along the continuum in between those two extremes
566510 america is a nation dramatically affected by the faith views of its people
566511 go away no touch you count to five and give me candy

566515 como el grupo de programas creados por rebeldes comunistas que no tienen suficiente desarrollo o las bellisimas cualidades de el software creado por microsoft y que se encuentran gratuitos por la red porque su numero de usuario es muy bajo los cuales para poder usarlos te obligan a instalar linux porque el software libre no es multiplataforma

566524 paramount importance to study the roots of terrorism and other forms of violence
566525 deeply concerned that funding such research through the pentagon may pose a potential conflict of interest
566526 elements of national power beyond the guns and steel of the military
566527 in iraq and afghanistan the heroic efforts and best intentions of our men and women in uniform have at times been undercut by a lack of knowledge of the culture and people they are dealing with every day
566528 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
566529 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
566530 this is the first significant effort in 30 or 40 years to engage social sciences on a large scale by the department of defense
566531 there was an effort during the vietnam era that ended up being ill conceived and burned bridges on both sides and unfortunately these attitudes have persisted
566532 return to the acceptance of eggheads and ideas if it is to meet the russian challenge
566533 research about a potential conflict with china i feel may be part of a large self fulfilling prophecy
566534 that kind of research could lead up to an increasing escalation of military tensions and military preparations for war
566535 contribute to creating more national and human insecurity by trafficking in the construction of a connection between islam and violence
566536 how theyve damaged our international reputation and how theyve damaged the lives of people around the world
566537 hopefully a project like minerva will provide some historical perspective before rather than after it is needed
566538 because they are concerned i might be some kind of intelligence agent were all going to be seen as potentially serving the state as being the eyes and ears of american foreign policy
566539 he who dwells in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty no evil shall befall you nor shall any plague come near your dwelling
566540 in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world

566543 although men have higher incidence and mortality from all non sex specific forms of cancer than women the public face of cancer in our study was overwhelmingly female
566544 this imbalance in television reportage of cancer may be distorting political and community perceptions about which cancers are most prevalent and tractable and thereby deserving of government and community support research investment and individual vigilance
566545 for example breast cancer attracts unparalleled research funding from individuals and governments while other cancers causing more disability struggle to gain a fraction of such support 50 000 jobs
566546 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
566547 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
566548 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities 50 000 jobs
566549 compare it with the way prime minister kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan are going
566550 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
566551 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december he said
566552 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
566553 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
566554 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
566555 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would 50 000 jobs
566556 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings
566557 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
566558 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them
566559 were flight attendants we have to fly in the aircraft its just a natural request
566560 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere professor mallavarapu said in a statement
566561 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
566562 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work prof mallavarapu said
566563 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different he said
566564 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible
566565 the number of retail outlets selling ethanol blend has increased three fold over the past two years concentrating in queensland and new south wales and to a lesser extent in south australia and victoria
566566 price would be a contributor but i think people are interested in being more environmental about their fuels and also promoting an alternative source of fuel
566567 the goose poop is the most disgusting of all and it cant be healthy for children or adults to walk around out there
566568 cant someone from the city at least occasionally take a giant fire hose and blast the goose poop off the pathway
566569 one of the contributors to the problems we have at this lake and some of the others is park patrons feeding the geese
566570 this encourages them to stay around and get dependent on that source of food we have signs posted but unfortunately they are largely ignored
566571 when christians disagree dealing with and delighting in our differences
566572 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
566573 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
566574 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
566575 either the bible is the inerrant word of god or a bunch of garbage that you can simply throw out
566576 clear the gate area this is not a drill we have a situation
566577 face down yes you and whos that woman with you
566578 we could be dealing with a weapon of mass destruction right theres two of em one male one female
566579 whatever you and her both enemy combatants got no rights if youre lucky youll go to gitmo but if i had my way id render you
566580 no punk rendition means sending you to syria or maybe egypt they dont fool around with terrorists they pass up waterboarding and go straight to the heavy stuff
566581 if 50 000 people in montgomery can stick together and achieve their goal we too can do the same
566582 we had seen little or no movement in the scores for these grade levels in recent years so this is an encouraging sign
566583 the last 12 hours have been a very violent 12 hours for our city
566584 but i thought it would be prudent to take advantage of it buying school supplies is something you have to do so you might as well do it today
566585 whoever wins in november health care is going to be on the front burner in january
566586 he said he didnt think he could take a life and wasnt sure he would come home
566587 after he saw saving private ryan he talked more about the war
566588 hed come home from swift amp co nap shower and shave and have dinner with all of us kiss us goodbye and go to eds until 10 30 11 p m mom always said when he got home he would come to us when we were sleeping and give us a kiss
566589 the look on the customers face when they saw their flowers or corsages it gave him strength
566590 at the funeral my mother pinned a gardenia on his lapel
566591 she wanted to give him back the first flower he gave her
566592 the idea is that kids are really driving the play
566593 were really poised to take off and build something really great for kansas city
566594 the more that we sell here the less we have to move
566595 im all about the dopeness but youre all about the wackness
566596 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
566597 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
566598 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden

566674 no nos gusta a adi que de juana est en la calle nos repugna pero somos mejores porque acatamos escrupulosamente la ley y no toleraremos el menor atisbo de menosprecio a las v ctimas
566675 todos los espa oles de bien nos preguntamos que si las leyes que tenemos permiten que un asesino pueda salir de la c rcel y que nos sintamos como nos sentimos indignados estas leyes habr que cambiarlas
566676 es una decisi n judicial que cumpli estrictamente la legalidad
566677 the book is aimed at kids aged 6 and up although many activities are suitable for younger children with adult supervision and has been written so that older children can read it and find inspiration themselves
566678 most parents will agree that it is a wonderful experience to cuddle up with their child and a good book few people will say that about flash cards or pages of math problems for that reason we have prepared this book to offer some math activities that are meaningful as well as fun
566679 how any small business owner or self employed person can save thousands in taxes
566680 whether you are retired unemployed or working you can use the joy of not working as a practical and reliable guide to create a paradise away from the workplace because all of us need reminders from time to time about the obvious and the notso obvious we can all use a handy guide on how to enjoy life more
566681 posts will not earn any points in fact i may even choose to deduct points
566682 when we eat the good bread we are eating months of sunlight weeks of rain and snow from the sky richness out of the earth we should be great each of us radiant full of music and full of stories able to run the way clouds do able to dance like the snow and the rain but nobody takes time to think that he eats all these things and that sun rain snow are all a part of himself
566683 the life of a carrot and that of a cow are equal
566684 were not talking about offering coupons but about downloadable promotional credits
566685 they have the ability to send free plays to everyone in their database its the most powerful marketing tool out there we have a limited budget and they have an unlimited arsenal
566686 i dont think any of us really anticipated how they have been spending money on free play
566687 i have a hard time understanding what theyre trying to do at some point you reach a saturation point and people wont want to take out their own dollar
566688 we are confident that through interpretive rule we would be able to put free play in under promotions
566689 typically free play is a marketing promotion if we find we are unable to do that we will want to revisit the issue during the next legislative session
566690 the answer to my meditation to die was in the form of a spirit that came to me and started speaking through my mouth that of the real dead john lennon who told me he would take my place and i would have my way out the same ufo that brought him hither would take me out to the other side other spirits that of buddhas also appeared voices in my head that told me this was my way out i would be gone and john would take over my body so i wouldnt have to kill myself to be free of my torment this felt eerie and parapsychologically psychic and spiritual and seemingly buddhist enlightenment this seemed like the solution to my problems so i agreed to it
566691 in the grip of paranoid schizophrenia one mans metamorphosis through psychosis
566692 schizophrenia i have found is an extremely cruel disease it makes you lose your wits sense and sensibility which of course is a most serious thing
566693 beyond that it tricks or hijacks you from self evident reality so that your delusions are and do become reality for you then you react to your delusions and hallucinations as if they are true
566694 i lived in a classic paranoid schizophrenic world where i was on a mission to rally the world against the united states for having and illegally using replicated ufo technology during these years i contacted many foreign governments amp media with my testimonies of supposed classified information and contacted many us government agencies departments and offices with threats of a coming ufo invasion if they did not stop their top secret use of replicated ufo technologies
566695 i began writing then telephoning and faxing the white house and cia often times pulling extensions and inside numbers on the same exchange out of my head and getting my messages through to a variety of people at those places so due to the obvious insanity of my calls their security operations centers were alerted and my contacts were reported to them
566696 risperdal is the medicine that initially made me well and a yet newer generation medicine was added to the risperdal at my request in 2005 and increased in 2007 this add to the risperdal greatly increased my intellectual abilities and faculties even noticeably further
566697 it was after i found the right medicine that i began writing the book some of the writing in the book started about two years later after what the lady katie mahoney in the actual cia told me the last time she called in september of 1996
566698 she told me that i had really caused quite a stir that i had cnn calling them
566699 when the book got published i felt i had for going to be turning 50 years old made a major contribution back to society and to humanity
566700 this book should be required reading for anyone thinking about entering the mental health field its also helpful for family members of people who have the disease
566701 the secretary state transportation secretary paul a mattox jr has made it clear he wants the public to be informed about the tunnel project but he wants the information to be factual
566702 that can only be accomplished through one source the communications office
566703 it has never been our intention to deny access to information
566704 we are excited the work is resuming and access to the site will be provided when deemed appropriate
566705 by centralizing information the public will receive information from one source and it will be accurate
566706 if a reporter wants to visit the site or interview district 6 engineers we will do whatever possible to accomodate the request
566707 obviously we cannot allow reporters or members of the public to walk freely around work zones where safety hazards exist
566708 the presence of high pressure water and air lines moving equipment and other construction activities present the possibility of danger at any given time
566709 we are also considering some form of on site media information day at various time
566710 we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life
566711 we need to speak life to each other and that means change
566712 i dont think it can consist simply in prettifying public life nor is radio in my view an adequate means of bringing back cosiness to the home and making family life bearable again
566713 the process the culture has pushed people into this mindset
566714 i dont believe the problem is the people who are there they were raised in this system
566715 the policeman on duty was telling her she should apply to the police station near the protest zone but he added that it was useless to apply anyway
566716 how could the suzhou officials suddenly show up they had to have been informed
566717 we cannot voice our discontent through legal means it is fake democracy
566718 if they dont approve the application they should accept it and then turn it down these homeowners were not even given a chance to submit their protest application
566719 we are testing to see if the pledge about the protest zone is fake or genuine by filing the application it appears that it is a fake
566720 all seem the same like cookie cutter copies one after the next i am a bigot
566721 and try to take him alive if it is reasonable practical
566722 hmm ah a visitor we have i spleen er see
566723 and try to take him alive if it is reasonable practical
566724 and try to take him alive if it is reasonable practical
566725 why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme
566726 ill never marry you never do you hear me never
566727 we are not at the status of english premier league our league is not matured yet therefore some drastic measures must be taken to improve it
566728 with the presence of foreign players local players have not been given the opportunity to develop
566729 clubs cant cope so it is best that we do away with foreign players until the problems are solved
566730 this victory is bigger than just us so therefore i would have to say that it is my best
566731 ive got some really meaningful innings in my life like the double hundreds here at this ground and at lords in 2003 they have got to go down as some of my greatest achievements
566732 but so many south africa teams have come here since readmission and strived for victories so there are so many people back home who id like to have shared this with tonight
566733 we got off to such a good start at 65 for none and i thought a couple of more partnerships and we are there and all of a sudden after a couple of good deliveries and some sightscreen issues we were 93 for four
566734 then i just started focusing on taking my innings by ten runs at a time
566735 its a real bitter blow because when we had that partnership in the morning between paul collingwood and ryan sidebottom and set them 280 i would have put us to win because i knew the wicket was wearing
566736 weve just witnessed a very special innings by graeme smith under that kind of pressure we had that flurry of wickets in the afternoon when i thought wed blow them away but graeme smith and south africa over the last three matches have been better than us
566737 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire
566738 for people born in the year of the horse it is recommended that they wear a pendant of an ox which will help to attract away the rat so as to minimise the influence of the clash
566739 the traditional belief is that you need an animal to attract away the rat
566740 according to the calendar it is an auspicious day there is nothing wrong with choosing this date it still represents a positive energy
566741 if you pick a good day this indicates a smooth beginning to the marriage
566742 you can see water trouble will be stronger in the second half of the year because of these seasonal elements
566743 if i do play well if i do start playing well like i did today i think i would be an addition to the team
566744 and if i dont play well i would not be i would not expect a pick i just want to play as well as i can and see where it takes me
566745 im a long way out of it at the moment and i need to show excellent form
566746 ive got four tournaments left and i need to play well in those
566747 if i do he may consider me for a pick if i dont ill be watching it on tv like everybody else
566748 all summer long and probably the past three to four months ive pushed and pushed and pushed and tried too hard and practised too hard and worked too hard
566749 ive wanted to play too well too much whereas now im just playing and enjoying it and seeing what that brings
566750 its really good to get back on to pure greens again as good as these are and start rolling in those four or five footers to save par
566751 i havent been making those this year and that puts me on the back foot straightaway like anybody ive gone back to my old method wider stance and slightly higher hands
566752 i think it was the best round so far all year because i played very solid very concentrated
566753 just one more round to go if i win tomorrow its a dream for me but also to win the tournament tomorrow is very important for latin america and argentina
566754 im not sitting where i want but i played great on the front nine
566755 i shot a really good solid four under on the front and got what i deserved on the back
566756 im determined to go out there and have a good time im playing good and im playing good enough to have fun the golf course is playing hard its one of those where you can get yourself in some situations
566757 no one is unbeatable but the way he was playing we all thought hes not going to lose any time soon
566758 i tried not to think of his winning streak and what his new ranking spot will be i tried just to focus on my game
566759 it was my intention to have a fast start and to step in and go for it and in the second set i just tried to stay with him
566760 i wanted to get to 20 under and i did that now ill have to reset my goals
566761 i did a good job of getting the ball in play you can score from the fairway here
566762 i kept going and tried to make some birdies you never know
566763 he hit a lot of good iron shots and made some nice putts hopefully we can do the same tomorrow
566764 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference but i made a few as well so that kind of evens it out
566765 it was fine i was focused on my round i wasnt worried about phil and im sure he wasnt worried about me
566766 i dont know what the other groups had but gosh we had a lot of people
566767 i thought the crowds were great they were funny made some funny comments and it was really fun they were great to both me and vijay it was a great day
566768 we both birdied 15 we both birdied 16 and i thought both of us played okay played pretty good
566769 we could have been better could have been worse tomorrow will be a fun shootout
566770 its going to be a big challenge with four guys being right there and a number of guys right behind us
566771 so im not really thinking about what it would mean
566772 before you were lucky to be in one maybe two olympics as you had to go and earn a living
566773 but now athletes can make a living through marketing and endorsements so they can extend their careers
566774 if you look at top performers in their 40s 50s and 60s the volume of training hours per day is sometimes down but they keep the intensity high they usually also do things to prevent age associated declines in muscle mass
566775 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
566776 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
566777 most home buyers or people refinancing their loans know there are financial booby traps waiting so theyre on the lookout for scams and junk fees
566778 a lot of issues that have long confronted low wage workers are now increasingly facing middle income workers
566779 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
566780 paramount importance to study the roots of terrorism and other forms of violence
566781 deeply concerned that funding such research through the pentagon may pose a potential conflict of interest
566782 in iraq and afghanistan the heroic efforts and best intentions of our men and women in uniform have at times been undercut by a lack of knowledge of the culture and people they are dealing with every day
566783 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
566784 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
566785 lower your expectations and youll have a better chance of having them met
566786 are about as authoritative as it gets when it comes to written judgments concerning national security issues
566787 they are developed to address the most serious of threats
566788 it would be a significant investment of time and resources
566789 for years too many of us have viewed global warming as simply an environmental or economic issue
566790 we now need to consider it as a security concern

566793 for example the child might start hitting their mother for no reason its kind of like alzheimers
566794 can permanently damage the brain kidneys and developing fetus effects on brain functioning may result in irritability shyness tremors changes in vision or hearing and memory problems
566795 it is even more important for children to get vaccines because their immune system is so weak

566797 i want to prove i can get to 200 innings and go from there
566798 i would like to go out there and pitch the ninth inning every time
566799 but thats up to me i have to lower my pitch count i have those innings when i start a guy off 2 0 and still get him out thats not really efficient i need to throw strikes right off the bat i need to get guys out quicker
566800 im young theyre probably thinking they dont want to blow me out for the season
566801 if the outcome is good you say well it worked out just fine now we can do it all the time but theres too much stuff that can go on that would make it swing one way or another you cant beat yourself up over it there are so many things you cant control
566802 its kind of like a bingo game for lottery players its a visual game that is played every four minutes
566803 its inexpensive 1 for 1 you could win up to 100 000
566804 by the end of the year im sure well have 2 000 locations and a lot of people on the outside looking in
566805 drawings will begin at 11 04 a m and run through 1 44 a m
566806 we are hoping that it will help our business by keeping people here a little longer
566807 there arent going to be too many places around doing this if it were like the regular lottery with a site on every corner it wouldnt be worth it
566808 all of the profits go to the ohio lottery profits education fund for ohios schools
566809 we had 7 000 last year we hope to top 10 000 this year
566810 im guessing there will be plenty who havent taken the time to register
566811 it has been a challenge getting war brides so we have broadened it to include war brides and anyone married during the war
566812 we thought it would be a nice opportunity for moms of servicemen past and current to share their experiences their concerns their prayers the entire event is to honor and remember this gives mothers a chance to do it together
566813 im more excited than nervous it should be awesome i want to experience the olympics first hand and see logistically how its ran ive only been to mexico and going somewhere different will be an eye opening experience

566815 het programma is iets waar ik heel enthousiast over ben het was veel leuker om te maken dan ik dacht want ik heb het verder niet zo op de tv wereld met het team klikte het echter allemaal ontzettend goed het waren allemaal mensen die met twee benen in die vpro sc ne zitten wat ik toch wel beschouw als het hoogste in nederland qua documentaires aan de andere kant stonden ze ook vol met realiteitszin als iemand bijvoorbeeld drie dure autos had moest dat toch ook even in beeld genomen worden dat was wel grappig regisseur rob hodselmans is helemaal te gek hij heeft ook de film van ellen ten damme gemaakt naast regisseur is hij ook een cameraman die echt oog voor detail heeft
566816 het idee is eigenlijk ontstaan uit onvrede ik zie nergens meer mooie documentaires of je ziet een heel zware documentaire f een artiestenpraatje wat ik wil laten zien is hoe mooi het leven is en dat er zoveel mooie verhalen zijn omdat alle artiesten bekenden zijn van mij heb ik meer tijd gekregen dan anderen ooit hebben gehad hierdoor is het n g persoonlijker geworden er waren een hoop dingen die ik nog niet wist van de artiesten maar sommige dingen wist ik al wel daarvan wilde ik dat anderen het ook zouden horen als ik dan zie dat mijn ploeg soms naast me zit met betraande ogen dan denk ik dat ik aardig in mijn opzet geslaagd ben
566817 het interview met dave stewart is een mooi voorbeeld van echtheid hij vertelde dat zijn geluk zit in een bord met pasta met zijn kinderen naast hem op de bank dat klinkt misschien suf maar het is puur en mensen kicken pas echt op iets als het oprecht is dat wil ik dan ook laten zien zonder het gebruikelijke cynisme
566818 vanaf 3 september sta ik elke eerste maandag in the sugar factory alleen in oktober neemt hans dulfer red het even over omdat ik dan in het buitenland zit het is vooral prettig dat ik lekker kan blijven spelen en iedereen kan uitnodigen we willen bepaalde themas doen zoals music amp poetry of iets met halloween in ieder geval kan ik aardig experimenteren en dat vind ik ook zo lekker van de sugar factory van dit soort gigs kun je eigenlijk ook het meeste leren het jammen is nu eenmaal anders dan die voorgeprogrammeerde concerten ook al improviseer je nog zoveel het bindmiddel voor de sugar factory optredens is uiteraard funk
566819 funk kan eigenlijk van alles zijn ik treed ook regelmatig op met dj ronald molendijk van zijn muziek krijg ik zon energie kick ik vind house heerlijk voor mij sluit het naadloos aan op funk van put your hands up for detroit krijg ik bijvoorbeeld dezelfde kick als van sex machine volgend jaar willen ronald en ik nog meer samen gaan optreden ook met wat mensen erbij misschien
566820 ik zou spelen met prince en toen ik daar kwam gaf hij aan dat het podium te klein was hij heeft mij toen afgezegd mijn keyboardspeler en ook sheila e heeft hij naar huis gestuurd maar daar hoor je niemand over natuurlijk was ik boos op prince maar hij heeft zijn excuses aangeboden en daarmee was het klaar ik vond het ook geen ramp om naar huis te gaan want ik was doodmoe dus ik kon het goed gebruiken ik vond het vooral naar om de reacties tegemoet te zien vooral omdat het vaak gekleurde berichtgeving is
566821 ik vind het vooral zo jammer dat mensen het blijkbaar leuk vinden om negatief te publiceren zowel op mijn site als telefonisch heb ik het verhaal verteld ga dan geen andere dingen verzinnen soms vertel ik namelijk wel eens de waarheid
566822 de waarheid was ook d t ik zou gaan optreden prince heeft me echt honderd keer gemaild of ik nog naar londen kon komen ik gaf aan dat ik niet kon repeteren maar dat ik wel heel graag wilde komen en hij maar moest zeggen wanneer hij mij wilde hebben toen gaf hij aan dat hij me alle data wilde hebben helaas mocht het toch niet zo zijn gelukkig heb ik al een hoop mooie dingen met prince gedaan en bellen voor sax mag hij nog steeds
566823 de cd kwam kort voor de zomer uit dus het is goed om dat nog even door te trekken er zit een vakantie tussen dus niet iedereen heeft het misschien opgepikt maar het gaat op zich heel goed het is nou niet de hipste plaat die ik ooit gemaakt heb of meest vooruitstrevende momenteel zijn we wel met wat hippere dingen bezig
566824 die is gaaf h dat had chance howard red zelf bedacht en gemaakt zonder het te overleggen die energie is ook gewoon lekker chance kwam er eigenlijk wat later bij omdat we al heel veel geschreven hadden het is zo een leuke man daar gaan we meer mee doen na de tour hij vindt alles leuk zoals mtv en hiphop hij is ergens in de veertig maar in zijn hoofd is het een ventje van veertien die van die stoere hiphop muziek houdt die kant wil ik volgend album ook op gaan en nog wat house achtige dingen erbij

566826 is er iets is wat jij heel graag kwijt wil
566827 ja heel veel waar kan ik beginnen het is natuurlijk heel druk geweest afgelopen jaren met het opnemen van het album er is een hoop gebeurd uiteindelijk is follow me uitgekomen in juni voor mij was het toch eigenlijk ook een hele leuke verrassing dat na twee jaar weinig van mezelf te hebben laten horen het album toch op 8 binnen is gekomen in de albumlijst dat was toch wel redelijk onverwacht de single beautiful thing kwam op dezelfde dag uit het nummer deed het ook beter dan verwacht
566828 het album wilde ik wat tijdlozer houden het is niet experimenteel zoals outkast of justin timberlake maar het is wel echte muziek met live instrumenten daar krijg je niet zo snel genoeg van daar wilde ik heel graag voor zorgen met dit album
566829 momenteel ben ik dus eigenlijk bezig met allemaal leuke dingen albumpromotie werken naar de winterperiode en we zijn nu druk bezig met het voorbereiden van de theatershow alle produktie hebben we in eigen hand gehouden dus dat is ontzettend veel werk ricardo overman managing director red is choreograaf en is zelf ook jarenlang artiest geweest en danser hij heeft alle choreografie n gemaakt en samen met mij het script uitgewerkt veel werk dus maar wel heel leuk het is zo te gek en het wordt zo ontzettend kicken
566830 de theatertour heet follow me omdat ik mensen graag een kijkje wil laten nemen in mijn wereldje ik wil graag laten zien wie do is ik wil laten zien dat het minder een product wordt en meer een persoon waar naar je zit kijken de theatertour loopt heel erg uiteen qua impact in een theater heb je natuurlijk prachtig licht waanzinnige akoestiek en de sfeer is heel intiem dus je kunt ook heel klein gaan enerzijds willen we de liedjes nummers zodanig uitkleden zodat ze zoals artiesten vaak zeggen bijna in hun blote kont staan we willen veel werken met akoestische instrumenten en backing vocals maar anderzijds ook weer juist helemaal spetterend met veel licht en videobeelden en twaalf dansers op het podium helemaal kicken en dat iedereen lekker kan dansen zingen en springen
566831 ik houd zelf van heel veel verschillende soorten muziek en ik denk dat we dat heel goed kunnen terug brengen in de show we hebben bijvoorbeeld hele kleine popliedjes zoals follow me of een jazz stuk van liz wright dreaming wide awake wat echt n van mijn favoriete liedjes is die we gaan coveren aan de andere kant wil ik ook een beetje rockachtige nummers brengen en old skool disco ik wil gewoon wat meerdere kanten van mezelf laten zien
566832 estamos muy felices de poder poner las fotos en people

566840 oh no fake yawn weve had a big weekend already
566841 das ist sicher auch der grund warum der 8 8 2008 als hochzeitstag so begehrt ist
566842 die wahrscheinlichkeit dass man sich dieses datum merkt ist einfach h her als bei gew hnlichen tagen

566848 mein klient wurde von der bank ber die zahlungsunf higkeit des hauptangeklagten nicht informiert h tte man ihm das gesagt h tte er das pfandrecht gar nicht unterschrieben
566849 es ist mir ein r tsel warum der besitzer des hundes nicht reagiert hat
566850 aber das kann nur die bezirkshauptmannschaft ber den amtsarzt verf gen
566851 die besitzer sind total geschockt vom extremen und brutalen verhalten ihres hundes und wollen ihn schweren herzens auch ohne verf gung einschl fern
566852 although men have higher incidence and mortality from all non sex specific forms of cancer than women the public face of cancer in our study was overwhelmingly female
566853 this imbalance in television reportage of cancer may be distorting political and community perceptions about which cancers are most prevalent and tractable and thereby deserving of government and community support research investment and individual vigilance
566854 for example breast cancer attracts unparalleled research funding from individuals and governments while other cancers causing more disability struggle to gain a fraction of such support safety scares
566855 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
566856 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
566857 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities safety scares
566858 compare it with the way prime minister kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan are going
566859 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
566860 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december he said
566861 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
566862 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
566863 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
566864 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would safety scares
566865 the number of retail outlets selling ethanol blend has increased three fold over the past two years concentrating in queensland and new south wales and to a lesser extent in south australia and victoria
566866 price would be a contributor but i think people are interested in being more environmental about their fuels and also promoting an alternative source of fuel
566867 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere professor mallavarapu said in a statement
566868 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
566869 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work prof mallavarapu said
566870 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different he said
566871 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible
566872 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings
566873 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
566874 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them
566875 were flight attendants we have to fly in the aircraft its just a natural request

566877 its nothing bad we just want to make sure it doesnt linger throughout the year
566878 the plan is to train and get it to the point where it doesnt hurt any more
566879 and however long that takes it takes i mean it could be anywhere from two weeks to five weeks
566880 last week i was throwing with max hall and dennis pitta and i could only run about five routes and it started bugging me too much
566881 i think the afterlife will not be anything like anything we can imagine i can imagine people floating around or walking around or being old or young or short or tall or neither since i can imagine it im pretty sure its all wholly inaccurate

566885 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
566886 we are concerned negotiations with drug traffickers means they are given sentences that are practically indulgent they become a mockery
566887 the next stage in extradition we want to examine with us officials is that any negotiation with extradited drug traffickers means they face a minimum severe penalty

566908 temptations to sin are sure to come but woe to the one through whom they come it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin pay attention to yourselves if your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents forgive him and if he sins against you seven times in the day and turns to you seven times saying i repent you must forgive him

566916 this record is about not stopping in every sense of the word and every aspect of life and it was created with determination that reflected that whatever you do in life if you go full bore youre bound to get wet with blood sweat urine semen or girls lubricant this record is about cutting in to the heart of existence and getting wet but its also about having no fear experiencing intense emotions from passionate feelings of love and excitement to the most anger filled hateful rages and everything in between embracing life and other people and coming together as a party in celebration of possibilities potential and opportunity its an explosion of human life

566922 your article about me based on an interview was seriously misleading
566923 yeah bro i do have that crib you said i do in kalivornia where i pay 2 grand in taxes but i got another crib right next door which is worth 2 million so thats like half of my first crib and i paid like 12 grand in taxes so thats like 6 times as much as on the property thats half the value bro

566926 i respectfully disagree with mr buffett the article wasnt misleading his central point to our reporter was the huge disparity in taxes on his home in nebraska vs those on his properties in california
566927 in the tight confines of a newspaper article we always have to choose which of an interviewees many remarks to report
566928 my initial point was the comparison of taxes on the two california homes its not necessary to raise real estate taxes across the board in california simply correcting extreme inequities in the imposition of those taxes would provide much additional revenue for the state this return to fairness could be done in a manner that protects homeowners with limited incomes living in homes whose values have soared several proposals include such protection

566943 we need to conserve that bitter impulse that we have inherited from primitive man it alone permits us the greatest luxury of all the ability to enjoy a vacation from the human condition through an authentic immersion in nature and this in turn can be achieved only by placing himself in relation to another animal but there is no animal pure animal other than a wild one and the relationship with him is the hunt

566985 the nashua riverwalk project has been a key part of the downtown revitalization efforts for the city of nashua
566986 it will undoubtedly provide a boost to the economy of the downtown area as well increased safety in the surrounding areas
566987 we are so fortunate that senator gregg has been a longtime advocate for nashuas riverfront in particular his recognition of the fact that the 1 6 mile riverwalk is a vital component of our economy and quality of life especially in the downtown

566993 a lot of times the u s companies because they were successful in the u s they tend to repeat their current business models
566994 i feel amazed and surprised when the exact question i am trying to ask the proper answer on that is already uploaded
566995 our goal is to plant the flag to be present said maneesh dhir aols india based international chief
566996 i do think local companies have an edge over international companies because local companies start with chinese services whereas international companies have to follow their overarching goal and cant easily adapt to chinese needs
566997 nashua therefore may not raise rates unless there is a cost basis for doing so and the commission approves such an increase
566998 as to ensuring these customers receive the same quality and quantity of water as customers located within nashua we note that being on the core system these customers take service from the same distribution system that supplies inside customers thus core customers residing outside nashua will receive the same quality and quantity of water as customers residing inside nashua
566999 nashua agrees to apply its water ordinance including the main extension policy in the ordinance in a manner that does not discriminate between customers inside and outside of nashua
567000 i dont think the regional water district was part of the ruling
567001 i dont believe necessarily that government should be involved in running a business
567002 to produce our beers anheuser busch needs a high quality and reliable water supply at a predictable price
567003 pennichuck has met that need for more than 35 years the city of nashua stated before the puc that they would continue to provide our brewery with satisfactory water service and we have no reason to believe otherwise
567004 the unfortunate part of it is all the legal fees on both sides which would only add to the trauma of the whole thing
567005 but they bring it in the tenants bring it in
567006 for the longest time i came home and scratched because i was so jiggy
567007 i still see landlords who dont know they have to hand out that lead certificate
567008 you never know if there is some law out there that is going to get you
567009 i wanted to make sure that as a landlord i was properly following the requirements of the city
567010 it was 10 years of wondering if we were going to have to file for bankruptcy
567011 even really good people fall on hard times and you have to evict them
567012 the myth that all landlords are rich and just drive around collecting rents in fancy cars
567013 it seemed like she thought we are different and we always go out to eat
567014 it is usually the last unit that you are making your money on
567015 if any of your tenants are not paying then you are working for free and nobody wants to work for free
567016 they knew if they screwed up they would be out on the street
567017 it saved my life as a police officer so i guess it is saving my money now as a landlord
567018 ive listened to some landlords complain about their tenants and when you listen to them you can figure out why they are having problems because they dont know how to talk to people

567028 if he has property in here he is going to kick this door in the minute we leave
567029 i grew up with a very diverse group of people that i didnt know who were coming into the house from different backgrounds and different challenges
567030 we have pretty much always been a working class blue collar type outfit
567031 it was truly that way if somebody didnt have the money theyd leave they knew you didnt do what we see today
567032 but the bottom line is i am paying for that apartment i have a staff i pay the heat the hot water the gas the electricity and i am providing 24 hour maintenance and they are not paying anything business doesnt work that way you need to get paid
567033 batesville casket beebe rubber places like that where someone could go with very little skill and earn a very good wage with overtime maybe benefits
567034 they could afford an apartment they could afford what they needed to live
567035 one car malfunction one doctor visit one from court and they are under eviction they never get it back they cant make it back
567036 those people immediately dont pay their rent for two weeks

567042 that is just so far from the truth in most cases
567043 they are not from nashua it is truly an investment property bottom line rent it bleed it dont do anything to it get every penny you can out of it
567044 with me these buildings are like family i worked my entire life on them i know every inch of wire it is very personal and i want nothing more than to help these people out it is a great feeling

567155 we had to make sure we had consistent treatment techniques we wanted to make sure we treated the whole watershed correctly
567156 the big success story there was keeping that soil up on the hillside
567157 it is beautiful the ground is healing and the trees some are 6 feet tall
567158 wow un altra testa di cavolo che non aveva un da fare oltre che far la prendendo pasticche a destra e a manca
567159 well i dont think i have that i cant have it
567160 thats what people with the issues say that made me very angry
567161 the thing about lipizzaners is their uncanny ability to put a smile on your face
567162 we want to work within the confines of natural ability
567163 commute wildly back and forth while technically still being everyones boss
567164 unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
567165 that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
567166 nicodemus answered and said to him how can these things be
567167 cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit
567168 but this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days says the lord i will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people jeremiah 31 33
567169 personal factors associated with leadership a survey of the literature
567170 yet when we compere our understanding of leadership in 1980 with what it was thirty years earlier we can agree with t r mitchell 1979 that there seems to be progress in our field theory and research are developing and much of what is being done is being used in practice there is reason far controlled optimism yet the challenger are still there far the years a head
567171 were putting that technology in place to enable us to do that
567172 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
567173 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
567174 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
567175 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
567176 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
567177 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
567178 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
567179 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
567180 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
567181 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
567182 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
567183 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
567184 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
567185 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
567186 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
567187 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
567188 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
567189 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
567190 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
567191 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
567192 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
567193 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
567194 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
567195 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
567196 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
567197 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
567198 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
567199 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
567200 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
567201 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
567202 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
567203 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
567204 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
567205 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
567206 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
567207 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
567208 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
567209 this is a little like saudi arabia announcing its going to conserve oil
567210 because we are such a water rich part of the globe weve never had to conserve water the fact were doing it now not only shows its important to us but a signal to the rest of the world it has to start doing the right thing
567211 we still have to fight a multi front war to bring the great lakes back from a tipping point
567212 my intention is to move this and move this fast
567213 its not the container size its the commodity were worried about it
567214 theres an opportunity for commercialization if you start shipping water out of the basin in bottles the dam has broken and everybody will be after our water
567215 we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life
567216 we need to speak life to each other and that means change
567217 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
567218 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
567219 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
567220 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
567221 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
567222 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
567223 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
567224 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
567225 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
567226 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
567227 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
567228 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
567229 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
567230 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
567231 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
567232 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
567233 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
567234 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
567235 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
567236 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
567237 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
567238 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
567239 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
567240 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
567241 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
567242 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
567243 who are open to doing something on the production side
567244 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
567245 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
567246 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

567289 todos los espa oles de bien nos preguntamos que si las leyes que tenemos permiten que un asesino pueda salir de la c rcel y que nos sintamos como nos sentimos indignados estas leyes habr que cambiarlas

567301 a person or thing that leades directing commanding or guiding head as a group or activity
567302 leadership is a relation of an individual to a group established in the interests of achieving some end
567303 must share the values attitudes and interests of the group this psychological similarity is necessary for the identification of the followers with the leaders
567304 leadership is the process of influencing group activities toward goal setting and goal achievement
567305 leadership is the ability of a superior to influence the behavior of subordinates one of the behavioral in organization
567306 leadership is the relationship in which one person or the leader influences others to work together willingly on related tasks to attain that which the leader desires
567307 we define leadership as interpersonal influence exercise in situation and directed through the communication process toward the attainment of a specific goal or goals
567308 leadership all ways in which one person exert influence over others
567309 leadership is the art of influencing others to direct their will abilities and efforts to the achievement of leaders goals in the context of organization leadership lies in influencing individual and group effort toward the optimum achievement of organizational objectives
567310 leaderships in the art of inducing subordinates to accomplish their assignment with zeal and confidence
567311 an arrangement of interdependen parts each having a special function with respect to the whole
567312 most theoriets agree however that a major base of influence is the possession or control of valued resources provided these can be used to facilitate or kinder the goal attainment of an other agent
567313 all the resources opportunities acts objects etc that he can exploit in order to effect the behavior of another
567314 one should not assume the necessity of any neat constant and direct relationship between power as a potential for determinative action and power as determinative action itself

567319 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
567320 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
567321 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
567322 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
567323 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
567324 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
567325 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
567326 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
567327 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
567328 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
567329 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
567330 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
567331 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
567332 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
567333 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
567334 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
567335 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
567336 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
567337 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

567344 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
567345 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
567346 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
567347 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

567384 of course as a politician and with his term expiring next year he cannot not think about a general election
567385 i am working under the assumption that mr fukuda will of course be the one who will call the election

567387 on the 24th of this month i have the distinct privilege of interviewing sheryl lee ralph phil wilson and gil robertson for a national hiv testing day special whats important about this special is a young man that i met a while ago who is tired of being tested and is seriously contemplating allowing himself to be infect over the years he has confided in me about many things he would never share with anyone else like his desire to to be infected i am not an advocate of telling a person how they should live but at the age of 22 19 when we met i felt like something wasnt right with that picture

567396 the energy from those clouds totally distorts sub space here thats why we cant use the hyper drive
567397 but then you pick up odd transmission like energy signals coming from under the planets clouds
567398 of course but we go out secretly to investigate anyway because you are convinced that whatevers stopping the engines is down there
567399 ive figured out a way to rig the jump shuttle to get through the clouds
567400 the descendants of some of the colonists have been living underground and they have their own society and culture and their own form of communication transmissions
567401 right they want to be left alone but the colonys old guidance and landing systems malfunctioned and stopped our ship by accident and now that weve found their underground city the colonists descendants wont let us leave so that they can keep their existence secret
567402 and theyve heard of you and me by picking up rendothirii transmissions so they know how capable we are and they put us under heavy guard their leader doesnt want to kill us but her advisors tell her that were bound to escape just like we did the last time the rendothirii captured us
567403 the leader gives the order to kill us reluctantly but just before the public execution a cloud storm of deadly energy strikes without warning and the city is in jeopardy it turns out that the advisors knew it was coming but were keeping it a secret in order to kill the leader and take control of the city during the confusion
567404 but i save the leader just in time and you
567405 stop the city from collapsing by reinforcing its molecular structure with my powers
567406 ok so then the advisors are arrested and the leader gives us her thanks
567407 and after we swear not to tell anyone about them
567408 we turn off the system thats been holding our engines and come back to the ship no one even realizes that we were gone because your programs kept the computer misdirecting people about our location on board to cover our tracks so we wouldnt get in trouble for leaving without permission
567409 the release of the engines allows the ship to continue as if nothing happened

567442 indicted polygamist sect leader warren jeffs charges of felony sexual assault of a child
567443 but the case actually involved incest and arranged marriage of a girl with her 19 year old cousin there wasnt anything that had to do with polygamy jeffs wasnt called an incest leader he wasnt called an underage marriage leader he was called a polygamist leader
567444 someone like a hugh hefner will have a successful television show with three live in girlfriends and thats all ok and hes making great money and thats all fine and great entertainment but suddenly if that man was to marry them then suddenly hes a criminal thats insane
567445 its female centered the women are the ones who are benefiting
567446 its not about another notch on your belt or anything like that it really is the women who really promote this idea
567447 because we need marriage for the good of society i think if we were to see this across the range of society the effect would be negative
567448 slavery and polygamy were the twin relics of barbarism those are barbaric societies that weve tried to move beyond
567449 if theyre saying thats immoral theyre calling the greatest heroes in the bible immoral saying that abraham with his three wives was immoral jacob had four wives david had seven known named wives before bathsheba
567450 who is this government thats in somebodys bedroom it was illegal for me to marry a white woman at one time it was illegal for me to vote at one time and if i had accepted somebody elses definition of what was right and wrong i would still be riding in the back of the bus

567455 you called me racist i resent it it was wrong of you i am insulted and angry and serious about that
567456 mike g said he was frightened by a black man running for office
567457 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
567458 when youre a scientologist and you drive by an accident you know you have to do something about it because you know youre the only one who can really help we are the way to happiness we can bring peace and unite cultures
567459 i am so tired of going to church on sunday only to hear my preacher preach about women who wear wigs and have weaves in their hair i have alopecia and have no choice but to wear a wig i think it is insulting to have a minister preach on such things
567460 recession proof your business how to survive and thrive in a changing economy
567461 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of the most iconic brands of the 20th century
567462 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
567463 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
567464 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
567465 that circle has expanded to about a five hour drive from a three hour drive
567466 car dealers and other retailers cannot continue to absorb rising costs at the wholesale level and not pass some of these increases on to consumers
567467 paramount importance to study the roots of terrorism and other forms of violence
567468 deeply concerned that funding such research through the pentagon may pose a potential conflict of interest
567469 elements of national power beyond the guns and steel of the military
567470 in iraq and afghanistan the heroic efforts and best intentions of our men and women in uniform have at times been undercut by a lack of knowledge of the culture and people they are dealing with every day
567471 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
567472 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
567473 this is a little like saudi arabia announcing its going to conserve oil
567474 because we are such a water rich part of the globe weve never had to conserve water the fact were doing it now not only shows its important to us but a signal to the rest of the world it has to start doing the right thing
567475 we still have to fight a multi front war to bring the great lakes back from a tipping point
567476 my intention is to move this and move this fast
567477 its not the container size its the commodity were worried about it
567478 theres an opportunity for commercialization if you start shipping water out of the basin in bottles the dam has broken and everybody will be after our water
567479 they have gotten such control over the residents through fear and intimidation that if you dont keep your mouth shut if youre a whistle blower they want you out of there
567480 ive got 74 in the bank no place to go and three clips and a 45
567481 im just waiting for someone to take a shot at me
567482 theyre never allowed to block a fire hydrant but they do it
567483 i believe hes a big kid or he wouldnt go around intimidating people who are just doing their job
567484 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
567485 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
567486 the potential for something to happen is much greater now than it was in 2001 simply because of developments of technology and education
567487 we may be putting dangerous pathogens in the hands of people who would deliberately cause harm we may also be putting them in the hands of people who may inadvertently or unintentionally take steps to put large numbers of people at risk
567488 if smallpox returned today we could contain it and minimize the danger very quickly i could not have said that in 2001
567489 was a very important event in the world of bioterrorism preparedness
567490 it did finally wake people up to what bioterrorism could do in this country and in the world
567491 choco latte fizzy foamy creamyconnisseurs that you expect to frequent your establishment i get no thrill frombeing seen with your designer cup and when the coffee was gone i summarily tossed
567492 last year was not a fair indication of the player he is
567493 hes healthy hes strong hes ready to go the other night he caught a lob and windmilled it so hes back all the way
567494 well first of all any compliment you get from your peers or your teammates means more than compliments that come from outside
567495 i didnt have time to rest my body so it wore down over the next year and thats when i had two surgeries im healthy again im as healthy as ive been in two years and im excited not only about this opportunity but im excited about the rest of my career because now i know what it takes and that weight room has become my best friend
567496 we know that the public at large is grieving the loss
567497 this is the first homicide now in several months since the roundup up of most of the gang leadership
567498 tragic events like these remind us that simply being a law enforcement officer in los angeles is an act of bravery
567499 juan will be missed by all of us and especially by his colleagues at mens central jail
567500 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
567501 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
567502 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
567503 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
567504 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
567505 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
567506 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
567507 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
567508 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
567509 my goal is clear and simple the gold medal in the womens singles
567510 i thought she might not be able to go on until 2008
567511 it took great courage and motivation for her to make it
567512 he is the kind of person that exerts himself to the utmost after watching him play i have become a bit more aggressive
567513 after the olympics i can finally live the life i really want to with holidays studying and marriage i am really looking forward to it
567514 i just want to be the woman who cooks soup for dan after the games
567515 this is the most physical camp ive ever been associated with
567516 ive never been associated with tackling people to the ground in camp its a long season you have four preseason games and 16 regular season games were definitely going to get enough hitting
567517 when you practice hard and give great tempo and try and simulate game speed you win all the way around
567518 im not going to complain were still getting our work in were practicing at a high tempo
567519 he trusts us to go out here and do the right thing
567520 weve been in full pads less but i think we get a lot of work done
567521 we havent lost a lot of players to injury we have a long ways to go until that opening weekend i dont know if its the right way or wrong way to do it but i do know we feel pretty good
567522 hes sure handed hes a big body you typically have people collapsing on you in the end zone he knows how to hold people off
567523 with a space at the end and without the quotes at the start of every urdu paragraph if you want to write an urdu word s in an english paragraph do it like this
567524 i got several where i was talking to someone and we were thinking of an interview and i said you know i have to go back to school in august and they were like oh never mind
567525 its true all over the state but especially in rural communities where people tend to drive 10 or 20 miles to the closest retail center or big town
567526 if youre going to work a whole day at minimum wage your take home pay may not get you more than a tank of gas
567527 the younger ones the 16 and 17 year olds are much more aggressive
567528 theyll call or their moms call several times a week
567529 it wasnt his first choice and frankly we hadnt thought about it either
567530 but he couldnt find a summer job and this is turning out to be a really good experience for him
567531 theres nothing so sad and ridiculous as a shiny nosed girl trying to be a charmer
567532 your reply to him told him that that is not what you thought
567533 how bout we go to that place you like on saturday say noon
567534 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
567535 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
567536 give all your money to the poor and follow me
567537 if you love me follow my words love god with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself
567538 well apparently these people were here for an iphone but their body temparatures simultaneously escalated to a ridiculously high level i saw them start to smolder and i was considerate enough to hock a loogey on them hoping it would stop any conflagration but no
567539 it really is nothing we can really do now but im next right
567540 you know that once we do this your other phone will be shut off automatically right
567541 then charge it up fully use it again till its dead charge it up fully and youre good to go
567542 theyre terrific for inspiration and encouragement but while the ideas are good the instruction manual is missing when was the last time you heard a guru explain how to set prices or write a web page
567543 why not be a gatherer of all thats out there in your field of interest you can self publish all your tip sheets as the best of whats out there on x
567544 we certainly wont be rushing macdonald back to play till he is ready
567545 we sent him home to be with his family and its like any head injury it will come right eventually
567546 he wasnt that far away but the doc will see him during the week and well make assessments if hes not right he wont be part of it
567547 were all pretty happy with the way richard went on saturday hes versatile enough to play at full back hes played a lot of football there for the highlanders in 2006
567548 he certainly handled the challenges on saturday night well so thats one option with rudi struggling with his knee that might be the option but well wait and see
567549 we will use tony woodcock as the thrower and john afoa as the hooker in the scrum
567550 tonys a very good thrower and has been doing a bit of work on it quietly in the background
567551 with all the injuries weve got in the hooking area we just think thats the best option
567552 you would have to say south africa are best placed to win the trophy in the fact that they have got three home games
567553 but we are in charge of our own destiny if we can win the remaining games then we have got a big show
567554 we struggle to win away too in the tri nations as does south africa
567555 youve got the three sides who are consistently in the top four in the world playing each other at home its bloody tough and you are going to lose games
567556 theres going to be plenty of enthusiasm getting over there and that is one thing thats certainly very important in these big games
567557 when you have a loss like this it just about guarantees that youre going to have pretty good performance when the team next goes onto the field
567558 creo que hicimos un buen partido y sobre el final estuvimos cerca de ganarlo con un remate m o donde el bal n peg en el palo tenemos que ganar el pr ximo partido contra quind o porque dejamos escapar dos puntos esta tarde y ojal m s adelante no nos hagan falta
567559 es muy valioso este empate porque esta neiva es una cancha muy dif cil para cualquier rival me siguen preocupando el tema de las expulsiones porque este deporte es para jugar y terminar con once esa ventaja no podemos darla
567560 wearing the underwear made me aroused i used to love seeing how annoyed people got when they found the panties id discarded in their homes
567561 were asking you to send in your drawings paintings photoshops and any other electronically submitted visual media that depict gary bettman in a moment of true valor and heroism
567562 kate and eric have been holed up at her parents house in muskoka canada she went there immediately after she and lance ended things erics been a great support for her
567563 did it just get hot in here or is it me
567564 thats a good decision for him if it makes him happy but

567566 are making noble attempts to preserve their natural assets create a user friendly infrastructure and build an economy where their citizens share the benefits of tourist revenue by bringing our commerce to such places we encourage their efforts and inspire neighboring countries to support these values as well
567567 i did it because i wanted to do something dirty to her
567568 i was frustrated at work i used the spray a woman had left at my house
567569 with it being proper for her that she spends a considerably long time receiving treatment
567570 it was a case that should as a rule have been returned to prosecutors for trial as an adult but the fathers infidelity had a considerable affect on the girls mental state
567571 we knew when it was introduced but we werent aware that it was the first in japan
567572 its a new realization that overturns the history of uniforms up until now we hadnt really set about marketing our traditions enough
567573 a lot of schools introduced sailor outfits based on our schools uniform we dont intend to change the entry in our pamphlets
567574 i wanted to get the kids interested in water so decided to make my classes as much fun as possible but i went too far
567575 every single member of staff here wants to work hard to restore faith in us
567576 he had adult dvds and a note with another womans name on it that made me mad
567577 i suppose ive got to think about her feelings too and im thinking about marriage
567578 i have no recollection of such an incident at all im considering legal action to prove that im innocent
567579 on the internet it said that you could freely grope people on the saikyo line so i did it
567580 shes very quiet but when i think about it she can have a bit of a one track mind
567581 they say to themselves im gonna be on espn2 and that plays with their heads
567582 its because its a family beach and miniature golf is a wholesome family activity
567583 you could argue that it all started at an amusement park in the 40s
567584 sometimes the kids get it in their heads to use the clubs to break them
567585 this carpet costs 14 a yard but it plays better than the carpet they wanna sell everybody
567586 the only time ill get mad is when you disrespect me
567587 there was this one guy who came in here and told me i had a chicken expletive little job
567588 there are lots of areas where you can bring your kids
567589 youre seeing a lot less of the real exotic types of itineraries that require more sea time because its so expensive
567590 with the caribbean one of the biggest advantages is theres simply more choice and its a much more flexible option
567591 during times of the year when theres more variety pricing will be more competitive as well
567592 we dont know if this is due to 9 11 but the growth is not surprising
567593 cruising is a perfect vacation for families because it offers activities for every age traveler supervised childrens programs and the opportunity for families to share quality time
567594 you can have as much as you want to eat
567595 you can have your children with you and yet everyone has their own activity
567596 dad i am not chattel or cattle please just present me and as far as officiating i just want you to be dad that day
567597 if you avoid expensive neighborhoods like this one youll do all right but the key is to plan ahead
567598 she says she is going to be an author when she grows up
567599 our government and our coalition will transfer full sovereignty complete and full sovereignty to a iraqi government
567600 the first china visit by a iraqi president since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1958
567601 has virtualized 22 of their servers in a effort to upgrade internal systems
567602 when i got the dvd from bob creator takashi okazaki i was totally blown away that he sent it to me no 1 and totally blown away that someone had made something that appealed to my sensibilities in that particular way so it was easy for me to attach my name to it
567603 it was even more amazing for me to go to japan
567604 to sit in a room where all these guys from anime studio gdh were trying to figure out what the story line was and that they would allow me to engage in it and actually be the story editor a lot of the ideas for the story line how it plays out how it all works were ideas that they let me throw out and flesh out and work with the writers on
567605 a lot of people ask the question is afro samurai more western than eastern and i think its culturally japanese no 1 so to inject my ideas in a western storytelling sort of way in a culturally different sort of way in a different sort of style i thought was incredibly generous of them
567606 i had spent a lot of time watching japanese cinema and chinese and korean and thai but specifically for this japanese cinema including a lot of kurosawa and just other samurai films
567607 i discovered asian cinema in that particular way in new york in the 70s because i used to do plays all over the city and if i wasnt rehearsing and i was just doing plays and my call time was 7 30 i would go to times square and watch movies all day they had three kung fu cinema houses and you could watch three films for a dollar so i spent all day watching kung fu films and sword play films
567608 twenty years earlier maybe of course ill be his father and i could still play ninja ninja
567609 i almost wish 12 year old kids could watch it but its a little too violent
567610 i think somewhere between 14 and 16 would be a great age to begin
567611 this was his first solo flight jumping off the cliff thing
567612 im probably going to have a bigger part in iron man 2 in captain america when that finally happens probably something to do with thor
567613 how do you take the second step of showing that even though 90 of the time you hear tell of free markets
567614 vote obama because its good to hurt when you pee
567615 these matters are always complex and take some amount of time in dealing with unknown offenders
567616 we started this association because we thought this discipline of music needed a common platform to represent issues pertaining to artists we want to hold constructive events that will bring together the music fraternity for common causes
567617 while 20 of indians suffer from diabetes and high bp
567618 incidence of homocysteinemia increased levels of homocysteine an amino acid caused by vitamin b12 deficiency is 70 this is seen more among vegetarians as this vitamin is mainly found in meat and milk if its neither boiled nor pasteurised
567619 vitamin b12 is also there in soyabean legumes dairy products cottage cheese etc
567620 i always envisioned myself talking to my staff in spring training and starting at the beginning but sometimes its not what you think its going to be
567621 especially with two guys i have so much respect for
567622 mark and dom are not the scapegoats for what happened but when its not getting done its usually the coaches that feel it
567623 our pitching hasnt been very good i accept the responsibility hopefully they can get some things straightened out
567624 i really believe im a better pitching coach now than i was in arizona when we had teams that led the league in era
567625 zawahri has been killed by them several times but once again this claim is wrong this is baseless
567626 the retreat at the parliament building will give the leaders the opportunity to have unstructured talks in an informal atmosphere
567627 saarc declarations are divine but the devil is in the detail
567628 we need collective action to wipe out terrorism in the region
567629 the robberies coupled with the kidnappings of hindus in the northern districts of sindh have created panic and insecurity amongst the minorities
567630 there are no calories so you can eat all you want
567631 we both love sauerkraut and we decided we ought to come up here and be with other people that love sauerkraut
567632 and she has eaten it right out of the can
567633 weve been here since noon and weve been eating our way from one end to the other
567634 it tastes good and i can eat it while im decorating you can turn it into sauerkraut you can have cabbage soup im actually eating cabbage ice cream right now
567635 youd be surprised how many people come back to visit their friends you might call it phelps old home weekend
567636 it really brings family and friends together its a perfect event for a small town like phelps
567637 i think what would be beneficial in the future is to have an additional off site lot within a mile or so
567638 theres only so much parking at cmac the key to less traffic jams is to get people to park at the off site lots
567639 here you have free reign to make an awesome high def cgi movie with enough fantastic action for everyone and enough story to satisfy every big time fan
567640 i see a red dog and i want it painted black
567641 there are no other international markets that need to be addressed in this manner
567642 i think what weve seen is that australia has a very sophisticated coffee culture
567643 people come in our cafe because they know us and they know theyll get good coffee were part of the local community
567644 starbucks is a mcdonalds coffee experience its not about the quality of the coffee its about convenience and location
567645 a few years ago there werent that many of them and they seemed to be going ok but then all of a sudden they were everywhere
567646 some city blocks had three starbucks on them its crazy
567647 what we do isnt rocket science im the first to admit that but youve got to have a passion for coffee that involves everything from grinding the beans to operating the machine
567648 you go into starbucks and its full of teenagers behind the counter id question whether they have that passion
567649 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
567650 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
567651 you can go to sleep grandpa ill just keep talking
567652 i would just like to take the chance to say that everyone is welcome to show their appreciation and come down to the lake with candles etc
567653 it is simply to celebrate the wonderful boy my brother was and the life he has had
567654 we will all be there to get through it and will share the memories doujon would like us to share
567655 on behalf of myself and the zammit family i would like to say thanks for everything use use have done and all the support that has been showed this truly is amazing
567656 doujon is in all of our hearts and will be forever
567657 to keep doujons memory alive i would like to use this facebook page as an online petition to rename the park next to the lake where doujon grew up and where i met doujon for the first time many years ago
567658 i think there are many things that can be done to avoid that circumstance
567659 part of that exercise was the pressure the dynamic if you like that was driving most of us not all of us but most of us to try and conclude an outcome in doha
567660 if we can get trade flows going again we can inject that much needed economic impetus
567661 this is why the round in itself was so important
567662 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere
567663 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
567664 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work
567665 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different
567666 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible
567667 pregnancy is a very natural part of life but for many women it can also be a very daunting and vulnerable time
567668 during a visit to charleville shortly after i became premier i heard first hand from mothers whod had to travel a long way from home to access pre and post birth support services
567669 i have also spoken to mothers who were treated by 16 different medical and midwifery staff during their pregnancy i recognise we need to do better for regional mums
567670 this is about delivering personal professional and local support to regional queensland mums and mums to be from the moment they conceive right through to the early weeks of motherhood
567671 they will have access to the same midwife or small team of midwives for every stage of pregnancy someone familiar to answer their questions and support them through this very emotional time
567672 they can stay close to home near family and loved ones
567673 it will also mean a much more personal touch in maternity care which can only deliver better outcomes for queensland mums and their babies
567674 we expect up to 600 mothers a year will benefit from the program across ipswich logan and charleville
567675 it is clouded by terms like regression which implies that loss of skills is growing backwards functioning level which implies that all functioning is affected at the same level and that this can be measured in a linear fashion and more autistic which implies similar things to functioning level

567690 duquesne coach ron everhart was giving me all the opportunities i could ask for even with all the talented players we had he gave me a chance it was frustrating not to take advantage of the opportunity
567691 at this point my mind set is not to worry about last year but to look forward to what i can do this year
567692 for me it was just great to play with a bunch of good players at the division i level and players well play against this season
567693 its a good time to work out and get back in shape and its a good place to work on things and to keep up with the pace of the game
567694 everything just happened so fast becoming a part of the team and everything
567695 i have two years left and ive been given a great opportunity and i just want to take advantage of it im just going to try to contribute and become an even bigger part of this team
567696 will be fun up front to watch going to be better than people think
567697 i really didnt enjoy real estate all that much and i realized swimming and coaching was where i wanted to be
567698 i have been doing some coaching this summer with the peters township aqua club and i thought i would give coaching a shot
567699 i didnt want to do high school coaching when you get to college it seems the athletes are more committed to the sport in high school a lot of swimmers are there because their parents make them go i thought i would enjoy college coaching more because of the commitment of the athletes
567700 by the time the u s nationals rolled around in march this year i was kind of burned out on swimming
567701 i wanted to get into something else but now after watching the trials on television i think i might want to do it again
567702 its kind of up in the air as to whether she would continue to swim competitively but im thinking about it after seeing it on tv i got kind of mad at myself that i didnt try
567703 olympic team member dara torres is 41 and shes still great theres no reason i couldnt do it

567705 there were a whole lot of great coaches there and i really learned a lot kenyon has had a lot of great teams theyre a real dynasty
567706 but i kind of knew dickinsons coach his team has competed against my dads for a long time and i know they have a great program im really looking forward to the opportunity
567707 they have a solid program and i think i can help
567708 for one thing since im so young i can relate to what the swimmers are going through with trying to juggle swimming and schoolwork and all that goes with it
567709 i know i will have to earn the dickinson swimmers respect they might respect me for what i have done but i still will have to earn their respect as a coach
567710 im looking forward to it i think its a great opportunity to get started in my career

567751 we are sounding the alert now that the commissions must if they are going to have any validity in the years to come must really undergo a major significant change in the way they operate to ensure there isnt the kind of abuse that is too easily brought about today
567752 we cannot have several human rights commissions investigating the same charges
567753 otherwise the system is going to become clogged by individuals or organizations who seek to undermine the real purpose of the human rights commissions and create political forums
567754 whose aim it is to harass and thats where educated investigators become very important
567755 it was a different debate that was raging several months ago it was very specific and very narrow and we quite frankly didnt want to muddy the waters on that debate

567757 having you as a daughter was the best part of my life
567758 i dont think ive missed one since i was born
567759 i can remember when i was a little boy all the farm tractors that used to be there when i was 3 or 4 years old i had to sit on every tractor that was there and i remember my dad picking me up on those tractors
567760 the same people are still there but now were there with our kids and our kids are showing cattle and showing pigs and doing things at the farm show
567761 fifty years ago a lot of the people who live in the city had a grandfather or uncle that lived on the farm
567762 maybe they got to go there on sunday but they still had that touch
567763 but now were a generation away from that its neat to educate them where the food comes from and how safe it is
567764 i like the community atmosphere the emphasis on tradition the livestock shows the dairy shows i just think its a nice event
567765 for the most part kids are raising these animals to fund their college education
567766 its important for the agricultural community its an opportunity for them to come together its friendly competition but its also a means of evaluating what youre doing compared to what your neighbor might be doing as far as production
567767 i think its as important now as its ever been maybe more so that the general public understands what agriculture is all about what it takes to produce food that we understand that milk comes from a dairy cow

567804 there is some good physics writing in both of these books which gives them a feeling of credibility unfortunately the authors jump from solid proven concepts in science to concepts that are outside of physics and to which the logical bridge is extremely shaky or nonexistent
567805 i have to say before i went to the seminar i didnt really care about recycling
567806 now i see how important it is that we recycle and i want to make sure people are recycling
567807 genocide interests me because its an issue that we as a civilization can really change people shouldnt have to suffer because of the ethnic group that they belong to
567808 top scholars and policy practitioners together to speak with a select generation of future leaders interested in americas role in the world
567809 she was highly recommended by one of her teachers and she submitted an impressive essay that highlighted the importance of raising awareness of genocide as a worldwide issue
567810 most of us at the seminar didnt really know the issues facing the world today
567811 it was really eye opening everybody there had a deep concern for world issues and everybody there took back the idea that they wanted to change to world
567812 some of the most interesting and funniest people i know are teachers particularly social studies teachers
567813 i would say that teammates are your best friends in life
567814 reid was a very strong supporter of the township building and there were some people who were extremely against it
567815 he had the vision at the time and he stood up for it
567816 i knew what he was capable of doing and we worked well together
567817 i can still hear him say if we dont have the money were not doing any expansions
567818 he loved to laugh and he could joke and still be a banker that was the amazing part
567819 he used to drive them to and from that hospital in the same day
567820 not too many people would want to do that but dad loved it
567821 he would run a concession stand for them at the detroit tigers training camp
567822 he was married there he joined there and he remained as a member there ever since
567823 i could bounce ideas off him and get a lot of good feedback he was dependable and you could count on him
567824 i only talk about reptiles and amphibians that are native to pennsylvania
567825 my hope is if you get kids to touch a snake or a salamander now they will be less likely to be afraid of them or kill them later
567826 the nicest snake in pennsylvania because youd have to open its mouth and stick your finger in it to get it to bite you
567827 if you find a toad you wouldnt want to pick it up and lick it because it would taste really bad
567828 and it will also release a liquid all over you
567829 and i think its important for kids to experience the world outside them i dont think they get enough of that these days
567830 i like how they eat how they feel what they eat
567831 and i like the way they look i guess i like everything about them
567832 i hope all kids learn about the fauna in western pennsylvania and that they want to be outside looking for bugs or snakes or whatever

567836 people think because they dont see people living on the streets in cardboard boxes that it doesnt exist here theyre wrong
567837 until it opens weve been putting people up for a few nights in a hotel because its all we can do
567838 sometimes we also send them to the shelter in new castle
567839 youre only supposed to stay for 30 days there but they ended up keeping us for six months because we had nowhere else to go
567840 i was obeying the rules and doing what i was supposed to be doing so they kept working with me until i could find a more permanent place to live
567841 they need to let people know about the resources that are out there because most people dont know these agencies exist
567842 theres no homeless shelter here so people have no way of finding out this information
567843 i was like that but now im not shy about asking when i need something
567844 but god lined up all these people to do this for me i didnt do this by myself thats for sure
567845 were hoping for as many as 5 000 attendees and have booked hotel rooms from washington to uniontown
567846 last year the hcea convention in colchester conn drew about 7 000 visitors
567847 nowadays theres a lot more interest in this equipment and a lot of shows around the country
567848 this will be the third time weve hosted the hcea convention
567849 they liked our site so much in 1993 and 99 they asked us to host them again this year like dummies we said yes its a heck of a lot of work but its also a good way to meet up with old friends you usually see only once a year
567850 a lady said she had drops of water on her windshield and several people said they had water on their cars we checked
567851 one of the cars was covered with dust because it was parked near a construction zone and there were clean spots amidst the dust maybe it did sprinkle but it wasnt enough the official word is it did not rain
567852 this is my fifth rain day as mayor and it only rained for two of those years
567853 this year i would like to promote my platform which is internet safety keeping children safe
567854 i already had a breakfast meeting today with attorney general tom corbett who spoke about this at my school
567855 im pleasantly surprised we can barely keep up with orders and we dont even have an internet web site yet
567856 though if someone wants to buy it wed be delighted to sell it to them
567857 these kids are able to ride a two wheel bike they just dont know it yet
567858 its a rite of passage for young people to be able to do this
567859 by being able to ride a regular two wheel bicycle that looks just like their neighbors bike it helps them become more integrated and involved in the community with their peers
567860 its a really interesting process because its so intuitive instead of teaching the student discovers the balance
567861 when they make that transition to two wheels their world explodes
567862 they have opportunities to work with and be part of a peer group they have for so long been excluded from it gives the family an opportunity to do something together
567863 you get them on those two wheels and it just amazes you youll see this huge change and just seeing the smiles on their faces thats what i get out of it
567864 his parents ended up locking up the bike at night
567865 because it kind of reminds me of races like speed racer
567866 it was emotional it was nice to see him having so much fun doing really well and having some optimism that hes going to get this and have success
567867 its something that he can carry on for the rest of his life not only is it exercise its transportation its the social element hes able to ride with the typical peers in his neighborhood
567868 weve tried to get him to ride a bike with his brother and sister and he just wont do it
567869 you name it and he does it except for riding a bike
567870 it was wonderful he was having a good time speeding right along
567871 every time the ground becomes uneven she becomes very frightened weve always had an issue with the balance
567872 do you think youll be riding a two wheel bike by friday
567873 if they feel im good i can do things if they can come out with that wow we have given them a real gift
567874 we buy 10 school buses which are painted in the colors of the high school bands
567875 it keeps getting better but whats also happening is costs are going up faster than budgets
567876 there are enormous resources to do good things and pennsylvania in general is a state that does good things or tries to that being said the system for kids who need special education is an entitlement the system for adults is not
567877 largest community based organization of and for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities
567878 the waiting list has been for the last 10 years and continues to be the no 1 issue facing families of children and adults with disabilities
567879 tina and my mom pat houpt sat in her living room talking about something like this four maybe five years ago
567880 you only have one chance to try and enjoy life i dont care who you are or what you do
567881 im going to take a chance and let them do my makeover
567882 cant have you getting your hair done then having hat hair
567883 the dance was supposed to end at 8 but the last guest stayed until 9 15 we were having too much fun
567884 the autopsy showed that he didnt have a heart attack no aneurysm no stroke basically there were no triggers
567885 its not 100 percent clear from the report how he died we want to get with dr wecht for a clarification
567886 the question is whether the tomei children can show abandonment which is a difficult burden
567887 i asked my classmates who helps you build things and make things and helps you bake cupcakes and who walks you to the library
567888 there are some group homes and programs that are excellent but there are some that are not ideal that leave a lot to be desired
567889 my aunt peg celebrated every day of her life she loved the sunshine and she loved the rainbows and every little budding flower
567890 there has to be a way to provide more people with these kinds of simple pleasures
567891 we would be serving 30 individuals each in three hour shifts initially we would need a transition period and a training period time for the clients to get accustomed just knowing their schedules
567892 we want everyone to have a part in it one family who might have a plumbing business could of course do the plumbing another might work on the hvac the fixtures the kitchen fixtures the ceiling tiles
567893 were accepting small and large donations we can even name a row of plants within the greenhouse in honor of someone
567894 were such a small community now some of our sisters cant go out into the community anymore
567895 in this country we have a lot of early retirees or the elderly home alone
567896 these people are leading lonely lives and they could be spending one or two days a week side by side with an individual who could benefit from their help and experience
567897 think of the thousand people you know who are retired some of those people dont have those connections any more with work or the family that were their lives
567898 i love the game and its good to see my friends
567899 san francisco real estate ktvu interview with real estate consultant pete sabine and ross mcgowan 2 in a series
567900 that type of weapon there is no reason for that to be sold we have to push more efforts for gun control
567901 your family cant come visit you your children cant play outside due to violence in your community
567902 black people are more cooperative with police than any people on earth
567903 when you call police they do harm to you and harm to people in your community
567904 can open their doors all day long nothing will come in except flies if you dont engage the youth and keep them there
567905 im sick and tired of the same issues and not being able to solve any of them
567906 when we come back for the sixth picnic i want somebody to say we solved that issue
567907 reid was a very strong supporter of the township building and there were some people who were extremely against it
567908 he had the vision at the time and he stood up for it
567909 i knew what he was capable of doing and we worked well together
567910 i can still hear him say if we dont have the money were not doing any expansions
567911 he loved to laugh and he could joke and still be a banker that was the amazing part
567912 he used to drive them to and from that hospital in the same day
567913 not too many people would want to do that but dad loved it
567914 he would run a concession stand for them at the detroit tigers training camp
567915 he was married there he joined there and he remained as a member there ever since
567916 i could bounce ideas off him and get a lot of good feedback he was dependable and you could count on him
567917 when the other hospitals in pittsburgh heard about it they adopted it
567918 the more i work on this the more i find out about the challenges they faced the roads they pioneered and the sacrifices they made
567919 the sisters of the holy family told me that on their time off they grew vegetables in the back of the hospital to feed the patients during the great depression
567920 despite what this looks like they told me they could get dressed in 15 minutes
567921 prior to that it was common for sisters to be burned out of their convents by people who thought they were trying to help the pope take over the country
567922 when their superiors came from greensburg and wanted to take them back to the motherhouse they elected to stay in johnstown and help out at the temporary hospital that had been set up
567923 the sister who gave them to me remembered giving them to patients
567924 we dont turn people away because they have money and we dont turn people away because they dont have money
567925 if its at all possible there would be sisters or staff or other residents to be with them and pray with them that still goes on
567926 the students were blown away they didnt realize that sisters were still around or that they were doing that kind of work
567927 they are still the pioneers they realize the need to do things that are not being taken care of
567928 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
567929 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
567930 but obviously if parker is 20 under john rollins has to shoot 10 under if parker is even par so it does put a stretch on everyone including me
567931 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
567932 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
567933 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
567934 i thought it was going to be the worst birthday ever after the first three holes
567935 competition brings out the best in products and the worst in people
567936 no youre not your stephanie parker the woman of my dreams the love of my life and just because you may not be perfect i will not throw you to the side for someone else because you are perfect for me i love you
567937 thank you thank you so much this means so much to me
567938 jonas this is ridiculous im dead you have to let me go
567939 no youre not your stephanie parker the woman of my dreams the love of my life and just because you may not be perfect i will not throw you to the side for someone else because you are perfect for me i love you
567940 thank you thank you so much this means so much to me
567941 jonas this is ridiculous im dead you have to let me go
567942 well she died several years ago so im not exactly sure what her perfume was called but you smell exactly like her
567943 we may be the top seed but in the playoffs every team starts with a clean slate
567944 i really feel like we are going to get a great football game we are happy that they have to come here but they have proven that they can win on the road they won a big game a couple of weeks ago at lubbock to put them into this spot we expect a great match up
567945 something had to be done fast and i was lucky enough to help no big thing
567946 i am a reporter for the new york times i want to tell
567947 there isnt to much to tell i own my business started from scratch after i left the army my wife and i attend church reguarly strongly support our goverment beleive in god and support the second ammendment the right to bear arms and ride an american made harley and vote republican in elections
567948 investment property is your investment property keeping you from doing the things you love
567949 try to be original in your play and as clever as possible but dont be afraid to show yourself foolish we must have freedom of thinking and only he is an emancipated thinker who is not afraid to write foolish things dont round things out dont polish but be awkward and imprudent brevity is the sister of talent remember by the way that declarations of love the infidelity of husbands and wives widows orphans and all other tears have long since been written up
567950 just when the caterpillar thought the world was over it became a butterfly
567951 woody allen was an auteur he did his thing and that particular thing was completely his own thats what i decided to do with music i want to create a directors role within music have to be in control of the project im doing i can create different kinds of musical worlds but the artist needs the desire to go into that world musically there is no one who has the career i want thats why i have to use film directors as a model
567952 roscoe is a one year old chesnut amp rust wire haired pointing griffon mix he is a very sweet dog and loves people roscoe loves kids amp is housebroken also he would like a chance at a better life amp a family that would make him feel secure stop by to meet with roscoe
567953 it like appeared out of nowhere like a week ago or something
567954 robin what did the five fingers say to the face
567955 an individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of individualistic concern to the broader concerns of all humanity
567956 i handle the notes no better than many others but the pauses that is where the art resides
567957 luckily my baby girl is as healthy as could be
567958 this is a pretty tremendous difference from the policy of old
567959 this is really an issue where highmark has to ask itself does this decision fall in line with the kind of community character that highmark has always had
567960 dear ms kownacki we are sorry to inform you that your application does not meet our underwriting criteria for approval
567961 of our patients id say 10 percent of kids have it
567962 it is unfortunate shes a very healthy child who has a very routine illness
567963 it really is an anathema to us to have to get state assistance we really feel uncomfortable about that
567964 he who observes the wind will not sow and he who regards the clouds will not reap
567965 those who are mature are those who by reason of use have exercised their senses to discern between good and evil
567966 to be spiritually minded is life and peace but to be carnally minded is death
567967 if you dont do what i want i wont play
567968 something should be done to those greedy b st rds
567969 a deep anxiety because people do want to know moral rules to live by
567970 the ability to act on the basis of own considered will
567971 few people who survived auschwitz continued to believe in the all powerful all good heavenly father or the scriptures
567972 therefore clive hamilton seems to pick up this challenge ignore the illusions of secular prosperity and lead us to something different who would not see some value in it
567973 i think the environmental urgency he responds to forces us to new thinking about the mysteries of existence
567974 its not very fashionable to espouse religious views so hes espousing a non spiritual spirituality which leaves everyone feeling somewhat confused he didnt know the solution it seems to be to charge up with some communal force but he doesnt say what it is or what it means
567975 its the idea of the classic philosophers life where you set yourself up as critical of modern life
567976 the big issue for me is this is all about morals and has political implications that are not spelled out
567977 i dont want someone deciding political implications on the basis of their own morals which would impinge on my freedom
567978 what i would endorse is that clive hamilton is resonating with a very ancient religious and philosophical tradition
567979 the betawi people in daily social life referred to themselves in terms of the location where they lived like kemayoran people senen people or rawabelong people
567980 sabeni became a famous name after sabeni was able to face another jago from kemayoran who was nicknamed
567981 the battle of princen park an area in jakarta which is now called lokasari
567982 many pendekars from sunda west java collaborated and exchanged information with those in the betawi region
567983 were trying to find americaplatz but we cant its so big
567984 were enjoying the party the atmosphere a lot of people being out here its really cool
567985 personally i like the polka tent because it has the good food and it fun to sit there and talk
567986 im trying to learn the chords but its not the same i think usually it goes the other way but this is pretty fun it works
567987 probably the vastness the amount of area it takes to put on such a display and its very organized

568009 as powerful as the u s military quote this comment
568010 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
568011 o lord have mercy upon me a sinner thank you lord god almighty for you are my salvation
568012 come we must take our journey do not be afraid first you must eat of all the fruit from the trees in this place they will strengthen and nourish you for the journey that lies ahead eat your fill while you are here

568014 youve known me and know me and will know me greater still
568015 come and see there is much more to learn and many things to see
568016 the lord has surely looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me because the lord has heard that i am unloved he has therefore given me this son now this time my husband will become attached to me because i have born him three sons so now i will praise the lord because the lord has judged my case and he has also heard my voice and given me a son with great wrestlings i have wrestled with my sister and indeed i have prevailed now a troop comes and i am happy for the daughters will call me blessed god has given me my wages because i have given my maid to my husband god has endowed me with a good endowment now my husband will dwell with me because i have borne him six sons god has taken away my reproach so the lord shall add to me another son and his name shall be called son of the right hand
568017 what time what day what hour can you be sure and yet my brother as you toe the line between two eternities both past and present this brightness shall light the dark of night and in the heat of the day i shall adore thee your own troubles will become small by the noble cause which was mine alone to bear whose feet impress the sands of time and whose voice shall whisper to you in each new day and yet if you should stumble or even fall i gave you this time to remember
568018 the rich man who wants to be seen as god whose passion is for others to see him as such in order to lord over the poor man can only help the poor man to see that in him self is christ the king and there he shall keep him safe and secure it will be the one thing that the rich man will be unable to take from him ensuring that he will always be free it will be the one thing he shall possess that the rich man will refuse because to find him he has to first become poor
568019 you must take your own journey now but i am with you always and wherever you go do not leave the way in which i showed you turning neither to the left nor the right keep your thoughts fixed straight ahead loving all and judging none i will be here whenever you need me i pray that you will one day you too will be planted like a tree beside the rivers of water that brings forth its fruit in its season whose leaf shall not whither and whatever you do shall prosper go now in peace with god
568020 if i go down i want company because i am afraid to go down alone so this will go down before me
568021 it was doing so 24 7 regardless of the amount of congestion on the network or how small the file might be today the commission tells comcast to stop and to disclose to its subscribers how it is going to manage traffic on a going forward basis we therefore take another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
568022 this is my mountain i will conquer it only i can sit at its top it wasnt their love down there that mattered i would never be worthy of it unless i succeeded to the top i had to sit on top of this mountain in order that all could see what i was willing to do to earn their love this way i could look down on them from the heights to be far away from their love because unless i made this climb i would never be worthy to receive it and so to me once again their love would be worthless
568023 but what what i say have you ever done for me
568024 cant you see what you rejected you were all that mattered to us but you thought your love was all that mattered you thought you could love but you wouldnt accept the love we had to give to you you pretended as if ours never counted for anything as if it didnt fit your way and now there you lay atop your heap of ravaged souls all pitiful and filthy on your mountain of pride and were supposed to care and we do but you still refuse to
568025 what then was our love to you not good enough for you or do you know something that we dont that youre not good enough for our love we never thought that way we tried always to love you but for some reason you refused what we tried to give so what makes you think that your love towards us is any better than what we try to offer what makes you think yours is so grand if you think its so great then you can just keep it for yourself we need someone to give our love to and obviously youre not it you dont want ours you only want to feel like youre giving yours its not that great anyway gods is more weve been hurt over and over by yours and thats not what real true love ever does it never hurts so you can just keep what you have and are trying to give because you wanted the mountain more than you wanted us you thought you had something to prove but in the end you made us worthless to what that was come down off of your mountain it only separates you from all that really should matter
568026 get down out of this mountain son of man and daughter of iniquity
568027 god look down upon me and see what foolishness ive become
568028 our father who art in heaven now i lay me down to sleep yeah though i walk through the valley
568029 this is the wilderness of sin it lies between humbleness and desolation in it belong your own sins that unless you look upon them confess them and forsake them they will never be cast into the sea of forgetting
568030 she was very dear to my heart but did things that made me angry filling me with ferocious pride i made her a promise one day but was not able to keep it it broke my heart
568031 and now o father glorify me together with yourself with the glory which i had with yourself with the glory which i had with you before the world was
568032 why do you reason these things in your mind if you have faith as a mustard seed you will be able to say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and it shall be removed from before thee
568033 it is the new city the great babylon be careful here
568034 they have reduced me to a stale crust of bread selling the blessings and keeping the mysteries that i had revealed to them long ago a secret in order that the multitude should have to pass through here in order that they might receive the blessings of my father they have created an idol an image to the beast outside giving it a voice that it might speak week after week they celebrate their solemn feast confessing their sins yet forsaking none of them they offer up their prayers and yet do none of what i ask and for this reason i will hear none of them these buildings that they worship in have become the whitewashed tombs of their saints and they have become like them
568035 she is the one that i gave to the master of the house and the innkeepers to care for until my return the one i lifted up from the road and ministered to healing her wounds
568036 never again father once and for all it has been finished you gave them my life and they have rejected me it is time now that all shall be finished
568037 come we must leave this place it will all be over soon and all this will be gone
568038 sin has become so powerful in the world that men are no longer aware of it they have become blind to themselves and because of this they believe they have no need of the father without whom in the world love no longer exists at least not the love of the father unless all men see their sins and are able to confess them their can be no forgiveness in the world and it is condemned to destruction unless they open their eyes and see their sins they will never know me or what i was sent into the world to do if they never see me they will never see the father who gives them life all shall die never knowing eternal life
568039 it is because of that that men have become blinded to themselves and only clamor to be heard it is also what will condemn them in the end
568040 but i knew their end from the beginning such wasted effort and vanity to build what could never sustain itself
568041 where ever your faith that i have given you will lead i will be with you always
568042 this way belongs to god he creates it and rules over it you will never find your way along this path only he knows its end
568043 how could i gain the wisdom to go forward by looking back
568044 be removed from before me and be cast into the sea
568045 mountain please be removed dont you see that you are standing in my way
568046 jesus my lord and savior you are able to do all things i pray to you please remove this pride of mine that stands in your way and cast it far from you and me and into the sea with your humbleness humble me my king let it be done lord according to thy will thank you lord that you have done this thing
568047 therefore if you will worship before me all will be yours
568048 get behind me satan for it is written you shall worship the lord your god and him only shall you serve

568052 what no one seemed to notice was the ever widening gap between the government and the people and it became always wider the whole process of its coming into being was above all diverting it provided an excuse not to think for people who did not want to think anyway it gave us some dreadful fundamental things to think about and kept us so busy with continuous changes and crises and so fascinated by the machinations of the national enemies without and within that we had no time to think about these dreadful things that were growing little by little all around us each step was so small so inconsequential so well explained or on occasion regretted that unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle what all these little measures must some day lead to one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing each act is worse than the last but only a little worse you wait for the next and the next you wait for one great shocking occasion thinking that others when such a shock comes will join you in resisting somehow you dont want to act or even talk alone you dont want to go out of your way to make trouble but the one great shocking occasion when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you never comes thats the difficulty the forms are all there all untouched all reassuring the houses the shops the jobs the mealtimes the visits the concerts the cinema the holidays but the spirit which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms is changed now you live in a world of hate and fear and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves when everyone is transformed no one is transformed you have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago a year ago things your father could never have imagined

568054 see i have given you every herb that yeilds seed which is on the face of the earth and every tree whose fruit yeilds seed to you it shall be for food genesis 1 29
568055 has god indeed said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden
568056 we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
568057 you shall not eat it nor shall you touch it lest you die
568058 you will not surely die for god knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil
568059 i will guard my ways lest i sin with my tongue i will restrain my mouth with a muzzle while the wicked are before me
568060 do not put your trust in princes rulers nor in a son of man in whom there is no help salvation his spirit departs he returns to the earth in that very day his plans perish
568061 where is it written in the constitution in what article or section is it contained that you may take children from their parents and parents from their children and compel them to fight the battles of any war in which the folly and wickedness of the government may engage itself under what concealment has this power lain hidden which now for the first time comes forth with a tremendous and baleful aspect to trample down and destroy the dearest right of personal liberty who will show me any constitutional injunction which makes it the duty of the american people to surrender everything valuable in life and even life itself whenever the purposes of an ambitious and mischievous government may require it a free government with an uncontrolled power of military conscription is the most ridiculous and abominable contradiction and nonsense that ever entered into the heads of men
568062 why is this man in the white house the majority of americans did not vote for him why is he there and i tell you this morning that hes in the white house because god put him there for a time such as this
568063 the coming of the lawless one is according to the workings of satan with all power signs and lying wonders and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved
568064 search for the truth is the noblest occupation of man its publication is a duty
568065 the modern susceptibility to conformity and obedience to authority indicates that the truth endorsed by authority is likely to be accepted as such by a majority of the people
568066 there are some whose only reason for inciting war is to use it as a means to exercise their tyranny over their subjects more easily for in times of peace the authority of the assembly the dignity of the magistrates the force of the laws stand in the way to some extent of the ruler doing what he likes but once war is declared then the whole business of state is subject to the will of a few they demand as much money as they like why say more
568067 has not god made foolish the wisdom of this world
568068 i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent
568069 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that
568070 if anyone sees his brother sinning a sin which does not lead to death he will ask and he will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death there is sin leading to death i do not say that he should pray about that all unrighteousness is sin and there is sin that does not lead to death
568071 actions are held to be good or bad not on their own merits but according to who does them there is almost no kind of outrage torture imprisonment without trial assassination the bombing of civilians which does not change its moral color when it is committed by our side the nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them
568072 if any man sheds mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god he made man
568073 for what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul or what will a man give in exchange for his soul
568074 and there are diversities of activities but it is the same god who works all in all
568075 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into apostles of christ and no wonder for satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light
568076 that you may be justified in your words and may overcome when you are judged
568077 one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all
568078 therefore thus says the lord concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name whom i did not send and who say sword and famine shall not be in this land by sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed
568079 dissent in america if you dont love this country then get the f out
568080 why didnt the british and american people stop their leaders from doing this
568081 mungkin dalam hidup lu lu emang mesti lewatin hal itu kalo ga hidup lu bakal lurus2 aja dan itu ga seru
568082 creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes art is knowing which ones to keep
568083 enough already i want to learn how to ink my stamp
568084 have a purpose in life and having it throw into your work such strength of mind and muscle as god has given you
568085 live purposefully and worthily and accurately not as the unwise and witless but as wise sensible intelligent people making the very most of the time buying up each opportunity
568086 mrs feinstein did not send her kids to public schools
568087 worse john pile even touches himself at night is that who you want repairing city roads vote for tommy fling because he washes his hands before
568088 i think after a few months of legislation we will wonder what all the fuss is about same as when we moved to mandatory recycling
568089 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
568090 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

568093 hillary hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralysed yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped
568094 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
568095 general petraeus and ambassador to iraq ryan crocker caution that the progress is still reversible but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
568096 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
568097 and in the months ahead the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
568098 it is im sorry to say that it is theres no place in this campaign for that
568099 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
568100 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
568101 so far all we have heard is paris hilton and britney spears
568102 i have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
568103 hillary hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed yeah i said it cos bush is mentally handicapped
568104 as barack obama has said rap lyrics too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
568105 which one of these things is not like the others which one of these things just doesnt belong
568106 politische blogs sind in deutschland so gut wie nicht vorhanden
568107 this is steep nasty country it takes awhile to get crews in and to build lines
568108 suffered terrible corrosion because of the battery that was left in the pedal
568109 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
568110 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
568111 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
568112 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
568113 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
568114 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
568115 you do have a stigma associated with the extended warranty
568116 who needs manny sox destroy as with bay leading the way
568117 two games a m and all is well in red sox nation
568118 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
568119 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
568120 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
568121 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
568122 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out
568123 and an interest in the natural world doesnt grow as it should nobody is going protect the natural world unless they understand it
568124 reinforce the idea that many children dont spend enough time playing in the green outdoors and enjoying wildlife something older generations might have taken for granted
568125 play is the primary mechanism through which children engage and connect with the world and natural environments are particularly attractive inspiring and satisfying for kids something magical occurs when children and wild spaces mix
568126 honey be very careful when you drive the ball do not knock out any windows it will cost us a fortune to fix

568136 para pemain tampil jelek sekali pada babak pertama ada lima peluang tapi hanya satu yang jadi gol
568137 tiga bulan setelah piala asia tim kita sepertinya belum siap untuk bertanding
568138 mereka sepertinya lupa apa itu sepak bola modern bermain cepat dan bertahan dengan kuat
568139 kini sangat sulit untuk bisa lolos tetapi saya tekankan semua pemain tetap harus berusaha keras pada pertandingan kedua nanti
568140 bila lebih baik saya dapat menunggu setahun lagi bila tidak tidak ada lagi yang harus diperbuat

568143 beberapa melodi dari lagu pelangi saya comot dari lagu instrumental genesis after the ordeal
568144 saya hanya mendengarkan melodinya tanpa menyimak aransemen yang orisinal ini membantu saya keluar dari bayang bayang versi aslinya
568145 it just goes to show what can be done when the boating public the marine industry and its representatives in congress row together in a bipartisan way
568146 that type of weapon there is no reason for that to be sold we have to push more efforts for gun control
568147 your family cant come visit you your children cant play outside due to violence in your community
568148 black people are more cooperative with police than any people on earth
568149 when you call police they do harm to you and harm to people in your community
568150 can open their doors all day long nothing will come in except flies if you dont engage the youth and keep them there
568151 im sick and tired of the same issues and not being able to solve any of them
568152 when we come back for the sixth picnic i want somebody to say we solved that issue
568153 the autopsy showed that he didnt have a heart attack no aneurysm no stroke basically there were no triggers
568154 its not 100 percent clear from the report how he died we want to get with dr wecht for a clarification
568155 the question is whether the tomei children can show abandonment which is a difficult burden
568156 i think its a great idea you travel all over the southeast and you see so many markers and theyre not always kept up
568157 i think this is just one of those things that is perfect for people to remember their loved one to cherish that memory in a respectful way i would love to be the first one
568158 but we are starting to see more and more of them there are a lot of them on the interstates i really discourage them because when youre driving down the road at 70 mph and most people are probably going 80 and you start looking for little names on a memorial your hand is going to go in the direction of your eyes well encourage them to use our signs
568159 the division had received complaints from citizens about these homemade memorials and some citizens do see them as a distraction
568160 some of these homemade memorials interfere with maintenance operations some are just placed in inconvenient places
568161 i worked with doh on a way to make them available it was just to give families an alternative some people have a very strong tie to the last place where their loved one was it was to be a nice complement to what the state already offers
568162 its a moment of remembrance my mother was the type who was involved in the community so for us it kind of carries on her message not only to her family but to the community
568163 its a reminder you never know whats going to happen
568164 i love the game and its good to see my friends
568165 i asked my classmates who helps you build things and make things and helps you bake cupcakes and who walks you to the library
568166 there are some group homes and programs that are excellent but there are some that are not ideal that leave a lot to be desired
568167 my aunt peg celebrated every day of her life she loved the sunshine and she loved the rainbows and every little budding flower
568168 there has to be a way to provide more people with these kinds of simple pleasures
568169 we would be serving 30 individuals each in three hour shifts initially we would need a transition period and a training period time for the clients to get accustomed just knowing their schedules
568170 we want everyone to have a part in it one family who might have a plumbing business could of course do the plumbing another might work on the hvac the fixtures the kitchen fixtures the ceiling tiles
568171 were accepting small and large donations we can even name a row of plants within the greenhouse in honor of someone
568172 were such a small community now some of our sisters cant go out into the community anymore
568173 in this country we have a lot of early retirees or the elderly home alone
568174 these people are leading lonely lives and they could be spending one or two days a week side by side with an individual who could benefit from their help and experience
568175 think of the thousand people you know who are retired some of those people dont have those connections any more with work or the family that were their lives
568176 i have to say before i went to the seminar i didnt really care about recycling
568177 now i see how important it is that we recycle and i want to make sure people are recycling
568178 genocide interests me because its an issue that we as a civilization can really change people shouldnt have to suffer because of the ethnic group that they belong to
568179 top scholars and policy practitioners together to speak with a select generation of future leaders interested in americas role in the world
568180 she was highly recommended by one of her teachers and she submitted an impressive essay that highlighted the importance of raising awareness of genocide as a worldwide issue
568181 most of us at the seminar didnt really know the issues facing the world today
568182 it was really eye opening everybody there had a deep concern for world issues and everybody there took back the idea that they wanted to change to world
568183 some of the most interesting and funniest people i know are teachers particularly social studies teachers
568184 i would say that teammates are your best friends in life
568185 it keeps getting better but whats also happening is costs are going up faster than budgets
568186 there are enormous resources to do good things and pennsylvania in general is a state that does good things or tries to that being said the system for kids who need special education is an entitlement the system for adults is not
568187 largest community based organization of and for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities
568188 the waiting list has been for the last 10 years and continues to be the no 1 issue facing families of children and adults with disabilities
568189 i dont think ive missed one since i was born
568190 i can remember when i was a little boy all the farm tractors that used to be there when i was 3 or 4 years old i had to sit on every tractor that was there and i remember my dad picking me up on those tractors
568191 the same people are still there but now were there with our kids and our kids are showing cattle and showing pigs and doing things at the farm show
568192 fifty years ago a lot of the people who live in the city had a grandfather or uncle that lived on the farm
568193 maybe they got to go there on sunday but they still had that touch
568194 but now were a generation away from that its neat to educate them where the food comes from and how safe it is
568195 i like the community atmosphere the emphasis on tradition the livestock shows the dairy shows i just think its a nice event
568196 for the most part kids are raising these animals to fund their college education
568197 its important for the agricultural community its an opportunity for them to come together its friendly competition but its also a means of evaluating what youre doing compared to what your neighbor might be doing as far as production
568198 i think its as important now as its ever been maybe more so that the general public understands what agriculture is all about what it takes to produce food that we understand that milk comes from a dairy cow
568199 were hoping for as many as 5 000 attendees and have booked hotel rooms from washington to uniontown
568200 last year the hcea convention in colchester conn drew about 7 000 visitors
568201 nowadays theres a lot more interest in this equipment and a lot of shows around the country
568202 this will be the third time weve hosted the hcea convention
568203 they liked our site so much in 1993 and 99 they asked us to host them again this year like dummies we said yes its a heck of a lot of work but its also a good way to meet up with old friends you usually see only once a year
568204 reid was a very strong supporter of the township building and there were some people who were extremely against it
568205 he had the vision at the time and he stood up for it
568206 i knew what he was capable of doing and we worked well together
568207 i can still hear him say if we dont have the money were not doing any expansions
568208 he loved to laugh and he could joke and still be a banker that was the amazing part
568209 he used to drive them to and from that hospital in the same day
568210 not too many people would want to do that but dad loved it
568211 he would run a concession stand for them at the detroit tigers training camp
568212 he was married there he joined there and he remained as a member there ever since
568213 i could bounce ideas off him and get a lot of good feedback he was dependable and you could count on him
568214 we are asking the spirits to guide to bless and to create an example for those who have been trusted with this place
568215 it is a unique opportunity for a land trust to be at a groundbreaking
568216 the challenge for local government is to encourage smart responsible government
568217 a lady said she had drops of water on her windshield and several people said they had water on their cars we checked
568218 one of the cars was covered with dust because it was parked near a construction zone and there were clean spots amidst the dust maybe it did sprinkle but it wasnt enough the official word is it did not rain
568219 this is my fifth rain day as mayor and it only rained for two of those years
568220 this year i would like to promote my platform which is internet safety keeping children safe
568221 i already had a breakfast meeting today with attorney general tom corbett who spoke about this at my school
568222 im pleasantly surprised we can barely keep up with orders and we dont even have an internet web site yet
568223 though if someone wants to buy it wed be delighted to sell it to them
568224 people think because they dont see people living on the streets in cardboard boxes that it doesnt exist here theyre wrong
568225 until it opens weve been putting people up for a few nights in a hotel because its all we can do
568226 sometimes we also send them to the shelter in new castle
568227 youre only supposed to stay for 30 days there but they ended up keeping us for six months because we had nowhere else to go
568228 i was obeying the rules and doing what i was supposed to be doing so they kept working with me until i could find a more permanent place to live
568229 they need to let people know about the resources that are out there because most people dont know these agencies exist
568230 theres no homeless shelter here so people have no way of finding out this information
568231 i was like that but now im not shy about asking when i need something
568232 but god lined up all these people to do this for me i didnt do this by myself thats for sure
568233 i only talk about reptiles and amphibians that are native to pennsylvania
568234 my hope is if you get kids to touch a snake or a salamander now they will be less likely to be afraid of them or kill them later
568235 the nicest snake in pennsylvania because youd have to open its mouth and stick your finger in it to get it to bite you
568236 if you find a toad you wouldnt want to pick it up and lick it because it would taste really bad
568237 and it will also release a liquid all over you
568238 and i think its important for kids to experience the world outside them i dont think they get enough of that these days
568239 i like how they eat how they feel what they eat
568240 and i like the way they look i guess i like everything about them
568241 i hope all kids learn about the fauna in western pennsylvania and that they want to be outside looking for bugs or snakes or whatever
568242 we buy 10 school buses which are painted in the colors of the high school bands
568243 these kids are able to ride a two wheel bike they just dont know it yet
568244 its a rite of passage for young people to be able to do this
568245 by being able to ride a regular two wheel bicycle that looks just like their neighbors bike it helps them become more integrated and involved in the community with their peers
568246 its a really interesting process because its so intuitive instead of teaching the student discovers the balance
568247 when they make that transition to two wheels their world explodes
568248 they have opportunities to work with and be part of a peer group they have for so long been excluded from it gives the family an opportunity to do something together
568249 you get them on those two wheels and it just amazes you youll see this huge change and just seeing the smiles on their faces thats what i get out of it
568250 his parents ended up locking up the bike at night
568251 because it kind of reminds me of races like speed racer
568252 it was emotional it was nice to see him having so much fun doing really well and having some optimism that hes going to get this and have success
568253 its something that he can carry on for the rest of his life not only is it exercise its transportation its the social element hes able to ride with the typical peers in his neighborhood
568254 weve tried to get him to ride a bike with his brother and sister and he just wont do it
568255 you name it and he does it except for riding a bike
568256 it was wonderful he was having a good time speeding right along
568257 every time the ground becomes uneven she becomes very frightened weve always had an issue with the balance
568258 do you think youll be riding a two wheel bike by friday
568259 if they feel im good i can do things if they can come out with that wow we have given them a real gift
568260 tina and my mom pat houpt sat in her living room talking about something like this four maybe five years ago
568261 you only have one chance to try and enjoy life i dont care who you are or what you do
568262 im going to take a chance and let them do my makeover
568263 cant have you getting your hair done then having hat hair
568264 the dance was supposed to end at 8 but the last guest stayed until 9 15 we were having too much fun
568265 luckily my baby girl is as healthy as could be
568266 this is a pretty tremendous difference from the policy of old
568267 this is really an issue where highmark has to ask itself does this decision fall in line with the kind of community character that highmark has always had
568268 dear ms kownacki we are sorry to inform you that your application does not meet our underwriting criteria for approval
568269 of our patients id say 10 percent of kids have it
568270 it is unfortunate shes a very healthy child who has a very routine illness
568271 it really is an anathema to us to have to get state assistance we really feel uncomfortable about that
568272 when the other hospitals in pittsburgh heard about it they adopted it
568273 the more i work on this the more i find out about the challenges they faced the roads they pioneered and the sacrifices they made
568274 the sisters of the holy family told me that on their time off they grew vegetables in the back of the hospital to feed the patients during the great depression
568275 despite what this looks like they told me they could get dressed in 15 minutes
568276 prior to that it was common for sisters to be burned out of their convents by people who thought they were trying to help the pope take over the country
568277 when their superiors came from greensburg and wanted to take them back to the motherhouse they elected to stay in johnstown and help out at the temporary hospital that had been set up
568278 the sister who gave them to me remembered giving them to patients
568279 we dont turn people away because they have money and we dont turn people away because they dont have money
568280 if its at all possible there would be sisters or staff or other residents to be with them and pray with them that still goes on
568281 the students were blown away they didnt realize that sisters were still around or that they were doing that kind of work
568282 they are still the pioneers they realize the need to do things that are not being taken care of
568283 according to my calendar it is now early august when will this reopen
568284 when are they going to open the new northbound entrance ramp to i 79 at bridgeville
568285 the clinton supporters told me theyre going to vote for obama but theyre not going to work for him
568286 theyd say ok ok i know hes the nominee just dont expect me to have a house party for him
568287 the women in rural areas the farm wives are not necessarily going to be that accepting of a candidate like sen obama its not so much about his color or at least thats not what theyre saying they just dont feel they know him he does have some more work to do to win them over
568288 this was the longest primary campaign in the history of the democratic party
568289 given the closeness of the outcome the length of the race and the loyalty supporters felt to their candidates when you have that level of investment yes youre going to have disappointment when youre on the losing side
568290 women as a voting bloc hold this election in their hands we know that a healthy gender gap produces a democratic president
568291 she has suspended her campaign and that is a distinction with a difference
568292 is not over she didnt end it i have not heard from her or the campaign that it is over and you could interpret that in a lot of different ways you never know
568293 ive been in politics a long time and its a good old boys club no doubt about that but she was an inspiration ms
568294 this has been the most personal of any of the campaigns ive ever been in and it was a big disappointment when she lost
568295 i saw the handwriting on the wall as soon as the media started to beat the hell out of her
568296 but for a lot of people im talking to its up in the air
568297 when the talk drifted to the campaign and the women i sat with professional college educated women were saying the one chance in their lifetime to see a woman president had passed
568298 our internal polls show he has the most difficulty with women over 65 and white men
568299 and frankly it confuses me that some people are still debating whether a woman should be the nominee its over i say and obama is their best choice
568300 my hunch is that in the fall it wont be women per se but blue collar workers who will be more of a problem for obama for a variety of reasons
568301 its her time a womans time than it was about some of the themes raised by clinton during the primary
568302 for the voters who fell into the category of the bitter gate comment overall thats a bigger problem than winning back college educated women
568303 i usually say something pretty trite like oh disagreement is the democratic way but you cant cut through that kind of anger very easily and have a rational conversation with someone in that mode so i just say call us down at obama headquarters if you have any questions
568304 but seriously are these people going to really jump ship and vote for john mccain i really doubt it
568305 he told the us we had 10 days to get over it well women arent over it
568306 i will tell you that women are far angrier than i expected it actually surprises me that women have resisted moving on for as long as they have but i think they just feel that in their lifetime they will never see this kind of momentum for this kind of candidate again
568307 we knew he was going to be little sore coming out and we wanted to give it a go and see if he could get it warm
568308 its always a quality opportunity to give reps to young guys like rookie quarterbacks
568309 i think the first time we played miami pro bowl tackle
568310 thats always a crowd favorite our team looks forward to it
568311 just because you were good last year doesnt mean youll be good this year
568312 as a defense we cant control that anyway the thing is weve faced all the best quarterbacks before if we stick to our assignments weve shown we can play with anybody
568313 youve got to approach it like you respect every opposing quarterback
568314 i remember when cleveland came in a few years ago i think it was a thursday night or something and tim couch just lit it up on us
568315 he still did some technical things im not happy with and were going to get those corrected but the great thing about him is hes willing to be corrected willing to be coached and if hes that hell get better
568316 the coaches havent addressed it to me in that manner i just perceive that and i just knew that soon as they put him behind me
568317 one good thing the way i look at it they didnt draft him originally to play behind me so it wasnt like they werent trying to replace me they thought the best place for him is inside in our defense
568318 were just trying to work hard to get ready to have a winning season and get ready for these preseason games
568319 im more comfortable because of the reps and coach has coached me to do what i need to do so i feel real comfortable
568320 theres been a leap in terms of knowledge of the defense
568321 and there are some things you just cant coach of course we see that but he has a long way to go
568322 having the offseason to work at inside linebacker made a difference totally my rookie season was about learning more than anything you have to show them in shoulder pads
568323 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax

568328 just be sure i dont die in here i dont like all these white walls they give me the creeps
568329 its not every day you can get great art at that price
568330 do you know how many people die in their sleep just up and go just like that
568331 but they were sure i wouldnt make it through the night
568332 we shouldnt wait until definitive information comes out by then we might have a virtual epidemic on our hands
568333 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
568334 a fter that initial rush of fame a new thermodynamic reaction must be set off under the famous thing or person most likely by a publicist if they are to remain in the public eye
568335 half a century ago it was the move from prints exclusively into the new media of television of course radio had come along some time before that
568336 now were at another point of great transformation it seems from television and different types of television including pay tv as well as whats happening with the new media and the digital revolution
568337 was an overreaction we think this is a strong institution
568338 its completely unprecedented to put a college on probation where there was no previous indication the college was in trouble
568339 were still completely perplexed why the college was singled out
568340 hes done a very good job as far as moving ahead on lot of different fronts
568341 but weve put a lot of time money and effort into strengthening it
568342 we felt the college was making serious progress but its being faulted
568343 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
568344 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild

568348 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
568349 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
568350 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him
568351 i came to the conclusion that this is a winnable race
568352 its like a family reunion in rwanda everything is about family and community
568353 before now so many of us were just struggling to get our lives going in this country
568354 were starting to get to the point that we can think about more than just surviving
568355 thats good but we have a culture of our own and we dont want to lose it
568356 ini tahanan benar benar istimewa semua permintaan dia kita penuhi
568357 should mean just that irish as usual the white countries are expected to ignore race and allow
568358 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
568359 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
568360 because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain
568361 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
568362 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
568363 we have identified around 3 500 of these temporary consents but we operate on a risk basis and because most of these have not been identified as unsatisfactory and are low risk to water quality they are not a priority of ours
568364 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own
568365 this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future

568379 resistant to insect infestation such as termites because the feathers are inedible
568380 they are also not as flammable or combustible as conventional cement and wood fibre composite boards
568381 conventional waste disposal methods when applied to chicken feathers are problematic
568382 incineration releases greenhouse gases and the feathers take up a lot of space in landfills and take a long time to decay because of the keratin protein that make up the feathers
568383 there is also the fear of bird flu which makes converting chicken feathers into animal feeds undesirable
568384 if the study results are good then we will apply for a patent and publish the study
568385 the next step would be to form a partnership with a company that can maximise this technology perhaps local food giant san miguel corp which has purefoods as a subsidiary company and through purefoods operates large poultry farms nationwide

568390 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
568391 what matters is that the wind industry around the world recognizes that the u s is the largest market
568392 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
568393 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
568394 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
568395 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
568396 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
568397 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
568398 this deal is like swapping your home for somebodys car
568399 sure the car is nice but is it worth your house
568400 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
568401 i dont think its accurate to say my comments have nothing to do with race
568402 heres what i was saying and i think it should be undisputed i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
568403 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist
568404 theyre cynical i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
568405 the world faces a global climate emergency it is now clear that only action by both developed and developing countries can prevent the climate crisis from deepening
568406 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
568407 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven national climate change mitigation and adaptation response
568408 the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
568409 our emissions per capita are higher than many other developing countries south africas emissions per capita are also high due to our coal based energy system
568410 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
568411 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
568412 you have to start with the recognition that most wells drilled in the rockies are not oil wells they are gas wells
568413 there would never be an expectation of huge returns on the oil side
568414 weve turned our western lands into a pincushion and gasoline is 4 a gallon and the price of natural gas has gone through the roof
568415 what these data show is that conservation and renewable energy are likely to be the solution to our energy woes
568416 on the oil side the data show that theres just not that much oil out there in the west
568417 youll go from a situation where were growing one billion cubic feet in production a day to a situation where youre flat or declining in two years
568418 its heavier lifting to build the infrastructure to ship energy from where its produced to where its needed
568419 it takes an increasing number of wells to be drilled each year to replace lost production the industry is running very hard just to stay in place
568420 opening protected areas of the coasts or public lands to new leasing is not going to lower the price of gasoline
568421 they seized equipment essential to the health and safety of the site
568422 they took away water pipes for the provision of fresh water and materials essential for sanitation and they even took away childrens crayons and a board game
568423 its political policing its not the role of the police to disrupt and delay a peaceful protest that is designed to tackle the most important issue we face today
568424 its hard to conceive some of the equipment being used for anything other than unlawful use
568425 were continuing to speak to the protesters and weve offered solutions for returning items confiscated and well return any items that we believe are genuinely to be used for the building of the camp
568426 we have to make a just transition to a more ecological society
568427 the crux is that e on should not be allowed to do this to make profits
568428 it really helped me that it started to rain because i went to the locker room and i talked to my coach vladimir platinek it wasnt easy to talk to him because he was really mad you know then i realized that if i start to play my game you know to put more pressure on her to step in the court then i have a chance to play against her and to win this match in the second set in the beginning i start to play like this
568429 this isnt some 5 000 itf tournament when you start a match on one court you should finish it on that court why didnt they send the other match to the banque nationale court
568430 i guess i was not the no 1 priority on centre court
568431 thats good because when the year started my goal was to stay in the top 50
568432 i mean it was not like somebody was commanding more and somebody was backing off it was just very tight and then i just started playing a little bit more defensive let her play her game thats how she got back into the rhythm
568433 we are conscious of what the amazon represents for the world
568434 its better for the countrys image to do things right so we can walk in international forums with our heads high
568435 the fund is a vehicle by which foreign governments can help support our initiatives without exerting any influence over our national policy
568436 the kipunji is hanging on by the thinnest of threads
568437 we must do all we can to safeguard this extremely rare and little understood species while there is still time
568438 our project is sort of unique because instead of having a construction company build 40 towers in a farm field each member city will have a turbine in town
568439 these wont be as big as some of the ones you see on wind farms
568440 its showing a commitment on the part of mmpa and the community that they really do want to build a green power solution
568441 its a visual symbol of conservation efforts and green power
568442 this brings it close to home as opposed to a theoretical windmill farm that may be several hundred miles away

568481 an industrial revolution thats what we call it down here
568482 theres a great opportunity there for a new industry to partner with the chemical plants
568483 theres about 250 clean acres a prime location for some industrial plant
568484 were open to just about anything anything that brings new jobs and increases the tax base
568485 there are byproducts from those chemical plants that other companies could tap into
568486 with the improvements the mines capacity is expected to increase from 4 to 6 million tons annually it is anticipated that shoemaker will return to full production by 2010
568487 we believe there will be opportunities to hire a significant number of new employees at both mining operations in the near term these are well paying jobs with good benefit packages an extensive recruiting effort has been under way in the ohio valley to identify future highly skilled employees to enhance this effort consol has established a new training facility in marshall county to provide extensive safety and technical training for employees at mcelroy and shoemaker
568488 the proximity to american electric powers plant and to the key ingredient of our gypsum board was a driving force behind certainteed gypsums decision to locate in west virginia said peter dachowski certainteed corp
568489 coupled with the support weve received from gov joe manchin and the state of west virginia we knew that moundsville was destined to be the home of certainteed gypsums new facility
568490 theyre willing to drive 45 minutes for a good job more and more people may want to move here with gas as high as it is
568491 we have an insatiable desire to grow the business its likely well have an expansion were looking at that possibility right now
568492 god has wisely kept us in the dark concerning future events and reserved for himself the knowledge of them that he may train us up in a dependence upon himself and a continued readiness for every event
568493 were not talking about offering coupons but about downloadable promotional credits
568494 they have the ability to send free plays to everyone in their database its the most powerful marketing tool out there we have a limited budget and they have an unlimited arsenal
568495 i dont think any of us really anticipated how they have been spending money on free play
568496 i have a hard time understanding what theyre trying to do at some point you reach a saturation point and people wont want to take out their own dollar
568497 we are confident that through interpretive rule we would be able to put free play in under promotions
568498 typically free play is a marketing promotion if we find we are unable to do that we will want to revisit the issue during the next legislative session

568532 the ballroom was all golden smoothed on cornices stippled on door frames damascened pale almost silvery over darker gold on door panels and on the shutters which covered and annulled the windows conferring on the room the look of some superb jewel case shut off from an unworthy world it was not the flashy gilding which decorators slap on nowadays but a faded gold pale as the hair of certain nordic children determinedly hiding its value under a muted use of precious material intended to let beauty be seen and cost forgotten here and there on the panels were knots of rococo flowers in a color so faint as to seem just an ephemeral pink reflected from the chandeliers

568591 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
568592 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
568593 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
568594 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
568595 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
568596 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
568597 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
568598 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
568599 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
568600 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
568601 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
568602 vi ska g ra det h r i r tt ordning
568603 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
568604 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
568605 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
568606 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
568607 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
568608 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
568609 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
568610 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
568611 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
568612 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
568613 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
568614 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
568615 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
568616 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
568617 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
568618 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
568619 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
568620 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
568621 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
568622 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
568623 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
568624 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
568625 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
568626 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
568627 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
568628 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
568629 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
568630 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
568631 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
568632 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
568633 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
568634 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
568635 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
568636 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
568637 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
568638 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
568639 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
568640 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
568641 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
568642 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
568643 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
568644 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

568667 nunca se vio desde la democracia tanto nivel de virulencia de lock out patronal de corte de rutas eso no fue por parte del gobierno no vi a ning n funcionario cortando rutas el gobierno tom una resoluci n en las facultades que le competen constitucionalmente se puede no estar de acuerdo de hecho as sucedi pero para eso se recurre al parlamento o a la justicia el gobierno jam s tom una acci n que pudiera desencadenar hechos de violencia
568668 mi autocr tica es la ingenuidad que tuve frente a la reacci n de los sectores chicos num ricamente pero muy poderosos econ micamente tuvimos la posibilidad de debatir un proyecto de distribuci n de la riqueza en serio y cuando uno ve la pel cula completa ve que los que se beneficiaron con el resultado fueron los sectores exportadores no los peque os y medianos productores
568669 es muy dif cil que los resultados de una encuesta no coincidan con la l nea editorial de un diario nosotros tenemos encuestas diferentes a las de el diario la naci n perm tanme relativizar las encuestas porque si uno recuerda las elecciones las encuestas dec an que hab a segunda vuelta y ganamos por m s de 23 puntos la diferencia m s importante en la historia de la democracia
568670 no deber a pronunciarme acerca de esas cosas pero que hoy sea candidato un hombre de color como el senador barack obama revela por parte del pueblo una vitalidad sorprendente y admirable revela una cabeza muy abierta m s all de los resultados es admirable que est compitiendo por uno de los dos partidos m s importantes del pa s un hombre de color

568673 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
568674 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
568675 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
568676 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
568677 i waned to be working with athletics but not necessarily as a coach

568702 we wanted to make sure the story we were putting out was really speaking to who we are
568703 were into building things like trust for instance and relationships
568704 the problem is that people buy a fund after the manager has proven that they are a high performer but they sell the first time theres a problem
568705 they wind up chasing performance buying high and selling low instead of sticking with a manager who has proven that they can deliver if you give them enough time
568706 proven that they can dig out of a hole because you have to believe they can create return fast enough to help you catch up from any down period you want them to be able to live up to the expectation you had for the fund when you first bought it which means you have to believe they can get performance back to what you expected over time
568707 when a manager loses conviction in what they are doing thats a problem
568708 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him

568773 i think were really at the tip of the iceberg
568774 despite the efforts of microsoft intel and others it was tiny innovative thinking different apple that forced the peripheral industry to move into usb country
568775 computers were designed to make our lives easier right so why do they make our lives harder
568776 none of this would have been possible if apple hadnt purchased next lock stock and barrel

568788 i also think you can tell a great deal about your new mate by the way he treats his mother and how she treats her father observing how a person regards that parent is key in establishing how he or she will treat you
568789 pam knew what was up but she refused to see it
568790 as a grandmother she failed very very badly i feel if pam would have opened her mouth and said something to codis father brian aston maybe codi would be here
568791 its still hard to try to heal knowing that the justice system wasnt really fair we are trying to get some closure but its hard

568794 and when he did throw strikes they werent in the right location
568795 really really good even when they were hitting me around thats the best ive thrown the baseball in a month and a half and to have that outcome is pretty frustrating
568796 the only thing i thought about was that when there were runners on second base they were giving locations maybe they had an idea what i was doing guys were leaning at pitches away but even without runners at second it felt like they knew where theyd be
568797 what ive got to do the only thing i could have done more was back them off the plate
568798 i really felt i should have got under their chins a little bit show them its my plate and i didnt do that

568802 when low income people do enroll in bare bones plans they face a significant risk of experiencing high out of pocket costs
568803 bare bones plans provide limited or no coverage for important benefits such as inpatient care and they often have high deductibles or other cost sharing charges
568804 we have a real diverse and neat collection of cars youve never seen the cars coming encompass about 90 years of history
568805 weve got everything from a world war i era rolls royce to some new ferraris and mercedes and lotus and all kinds of stuff in between
568806 tonia hoffert is bringing the tiffin economy car the adriatic steam powered horse drawn brass fire engine from the middle 1800s thats in the museum is going to be at the show it hasnt been out of the museum for years
568807 the week before theyre taking it down to the fire station and cleaning it all up
568808 a good number of people have signed up for the driving tour
568809 my due date was the 28th so we knew we were right around the move we were hoping to be the first one at the new hospital but the last one works too
568810 my wife was in labor for about 36 hours or so when we got to the old hospital there were two babies that had just been born and another one getting ready to be born
568811 through our girl someone else can live life to the fullest
568812 ive never seen a guy as long as ive coached who could lay flat on his back and can come up into a standing position in one move
568813 people usually have to put their hand down to come up but he can spring up in one movement its impressive
568814 each time after surgery ive been blessed to come back stronger faster and better than what i was
568815 i still dont have any soreness or stiffness in my knees i dont hesitate to cut on them it feels good
568816 with our quarterback senior brian hoyer we have two guys who can make plays for us on offense right out of the gate
568817 obviously ringer is going to touch the ball a lot
568818 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
568819 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
568820 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
568821 we have had so much sadness buried deep within us
568822 the torch relay will help it all burst from within us and dissipate
568823 we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life
568824 we need to speak life to each other and that means change
568825 how much is enough how much government do we need theres not a smoker in america that doesnt understand that smoking isnt good for you
568826 the minority leader said when is enough enough well cigarettes one of the most dangerous products on sale today are not regulated at all
568827 in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
568828 simply to defend the natural rights of man to protect person and property to prevent the aggressions of the powerful upon the weak in a word to administer justice this is the natural the original office of a government it was not intended to do less it ought not to be allowed to do more

568831 we must have a dialogue and cooperation and mutual efforts together to provide for every child in america to fulfill their expectations
568832 frankly if youve got 50 percent of african american or latino kids dropping out of high school
568833 it doesnt really matter what you do in terms of affirmative action those kids are not getting into college
568834 a shortcut to solving some of these broader long term structural problems
568835 some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
568836 should be a source of pride and when properly structured affirmative action i think can be a part of that
568837 if youre talking about assuring equal and fair opportunity for all americans and making sure that the practices of the u s military are emulated the greatest equal opportunity employer in america then i am all for it
568838 if you are talking about quotas i am not for it
568839 but all of us are for affirmative action to try to give assistance to those who need it whether it be african american or other groups of americans that need it
568840 es de toda evidencia que la importaci n de italia de demetilclortetraciclina efectuada por la demandada constituye la importaci n de un producto obtenido de acuerdo al proceso patentado por mi mandante tambi n se desprende de lo expuesto que cualquiera que use demetilclortetraciclina en este momento est usando el producto obtenido mediante el proceso patentado por mi representada cualquiera sea el lugar donde se lleva a cabo y que el uso de dicho producto constituye una defraudaci n de los derechos otorgados a mi representada por su patente
568841 por el momento no conocemos un procedimiento que siendo diferente a la fermentaci n aerobia de una variedad de streptomyces utilizada por american cyanamid pueda ser utilizada con fines industriales
568842 y que al parecer por la bibliograf a consultada tampoco en la bibliograf a consultada hemos hallado otros procedimientos distintos
568843 no se estiman viables en el momento actual otros procedimientos distintos de preparaci n en una revisi n exhaustiva de la bibliograf a cient fica no se ha podido hallar menci n alguna de utilizaci n de organismos distintos
568844 en el momento actual no se pueden considerar como viables los otros procedimientos diferentes de la preparaci n de demetiltetraciclina l gicamente concebibles que ser an la desmetilaci n selectiva de las tetraciclinas y su s ntesis total
568845 se verifica por la bibliograf a que ninguna tentativa fue realizada hasta hoy con xito hasta prueba en contrario se debe considerar imposible
568846 habi ndome entregado a una revisi n exhaustiva de la bibliograf a cient fica no encontr referencia o a procedimiento de preparaci n
568847 no existir en el mundo otro procedimiento posible de producir la demetilclortetraciclina
568848 que es imposible obtener ese producto por v a distinta de la patentada
568849 si es correcta la conclusi n a que llegan los trabajos mencionados en la pregunta anterior informes cient ficos acompa ados por la actora en el sentido de que no existen procedimientos conocidos para la producci n industrial de la demetilclortetraciclina con excepci n del que constituye el objeto de la patente argentina 111774 fs
568850 por el momento no conocemos un procedimiento que siendo diferente a la fermentaci n aerobia de una variedad de streptomyces utilizada por american cyanamid pueda ser utilizada con fines industriales
568851 siempre se ver con desagrado el rehusar esclarecimientos a la justicia y adem s raramente ocurrir que sea sin peligro el abstenerse de responder a los argumentos del adversario
568852 se pregunta si dicho principio ser a aplicable en el caso de que un procedimiento patentado que permitiera obtener un nuevo producto farmac utico fuera el nico capaz de producir ese resultado la raz n para dudar deriva en este caso de que el monopolio el procedimiento importar a por la fuerza de las cosas y contrariamente al prop sito de la ley el monopolio del producto
568853 ser a una consecuencia de hecho independiente del derecho el producto pertenece al dominio p blico y siendo cada uno libre para fabricarlo es tambi n libre para buscar e imaginar otros procedimientos distintos al patentado
568854 que es un producto no alcanza tambi n al procedimiento industrial por medio del cual se realiza o facilita su preparaci n esto sirve tambi n cuando el procedimiento se refiere a un nuevo producto medicamentoso que era l solo capaz de producir tal resultado pues el monopolio del procedimiento envuelve el del producto pero esto depende de meras razones de hecho no de derecho quedando siempre el producto en dominio del p blico y libre todo el mundo para fabricarlo antes o despu s por el descubrimiento y empleo de procedimientos diferentes al privilegiado
568855 puede al respecto ser m s eficaz la acci n criminal pero no est obligado el damnificado a plantearla limit ndose a la acci n civil
568856 l gicamente debe inferirse que la venta de productos medicinales fabricados mediante un procedimiento falsificado no es delictuosa puesto que la venta del producto en s es libre por disposici n expresa de la ley de admitirse lo contrario se llegar a al absurdo jur dico que implicar a no permitir que el inventor de un nuevo producto medicinal lo patente permitiendo en cambio la protecci n indirecta del producto por v a de una patente que proteja el procedimiento por otra parte se llegar a al absurdo de que el inventor de un nuevo procedimiento para fabricar un producto medicinal conocido adquiriese en el hecho un monopolio sobre el producto conocido en efecto con frecuencia ocurre que un nuevo procedimiento que permite fabricar m s econ micamente asegura a su titular un monopolio de hecho sobre toda una categor a de productos del dominio p blico
568857 tambi n es de se alar que la importaci n de productos medicinales fabricados por procedimientos patentados no puede jam s ser il cita porque la ley de patentes proh be los monopolios sobre esos productos si la ley proh be su protecci n por la v a directa de una patente ser a absurdo admitir que lo permitiera por v a indirecta
568858 el principio com n en las leyes de otras naciones
568859 en caso de alg n descubrimiento de composiciones farmac uticas o de remedios tiles para la salud
568860 desde el momento que el producto deba servir de remedio concluye no es susceptible de ser patentado
568861 we have to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in
568862 it really helped me that it started raining because i was able to go in the locker room and talk to my coach
568863 it wasnt easy to talk to my coach because he was really mad
568864 and he can run he looks great he looks like hes in the best shape by far as ive ever seen
568865 hes carrying it well and hes moving extremely fast for his size hes strong
568866 also im not that wide so a single number fits on my jersey better
568867 but people arent really going to see that when you throw more interceptions than touchdowns
568868 i felt like i tried to do too much at the beginning of the season and it just hurt me i felt like as the season progressed i started to realize that i needed to do the same thing as from the year before and not try to win the game on your own
568869 i think thats going to be the biggest thing this year not turning the ball over
568870 weve got some guys who need to see the barber right now
568871 some of them need a trim and some of them we need to get a hedgehog to cut their hair
568872 its funny we used to be so strict on hair and earrings and all that stuff i mean really strict now with all our kids here i like the kids so well you almost dont notice it
568873 what we try to do is just be a team
568874 he came in with his heart set on being a tight end and as our offensive has evolved weve really gone more to tight ends who are receivers first and blockers second ted kind of got caught in that deal
568875 the move to defensive tackle has been a long hard road because he didnt want to do it last year he stayed at tight end and consequently didnt play much this spring he came to me and said coach i just want to play which is a sign of maturity
568876 and not only did he just switch over to defensive tackle he really played well last spring he makes things a lot more comfortable in there
568877 but what kind of leadership weve got thats the paramount thing right now
568878 whos going to step up and be the leaders on this football team because the bottom line is i dont care if youre an nfl team or if youre watauga high school leadership ultimately becomes the difference thats huge for us finding leaders during camp
568879 i was back in the office the next morning and i heard a guy pecking on the door
568880 it was blake elder treys little brother he said coach nic told me im to read 2 samuel 22
568881 i thought that was an awesome thing nick had been doing that for three years and now its blakes turn in two more years blakes going to pass that on to somebody else i think thats what makes us a little bit different i think a thing like that is one of the driving forces for our football team
568882 we start off with playing one of the best football teams in the country if not the best
568883 very few teams play any harder than lsu very few conferences play any harder than the southeastern conference so weve obviously got our hands full but i dont think were going to lack for confidence
568884 beating michigan is something you dont forget and people remind you of it all the time but at the same time we know how to focus on whats ahead the coaches always do a great job of keeping us focused and working us hard that wont change
568885 our kids were extremely focused those four weeks leading up to michigan last year
568886 im fixing to get after them today before we ever start practice about being disciplined and being sharp and being focused
568887 against michigan we were the only ones who gave us a shot i dont know if that will be any different this year but i do know lsu will be ready we better be ready too
568888 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
568889 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
568890 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
568891 ive been making sure i get ice on it after every match it hurts sometimes after matches
568892 do people want to see drivers going into the turn at indy at 210 mph or 180 mph
568893 when we were all discussing the engine of the future a few years ago we were looking at 600 horsepower engines with fewer cubic inches
568894 they wound up putting it on the shelf saying we have it if we ever need it
568895 we have been developing an e 85 nascar cup racing engine which we plan to share with nascar weve been racing that in our corvette this year
568896 there is an issue of materials compatibility rubber seals and aluminum parts in the carburetor because ethanol is somewhat corrosive but we make e 85 engines of every variety for the street so our guys know how to make it work
568897 there would be issues to study like we did when we went to unleaded fuel looking at valve seats and lower end bearings
568898 but we think we can put a package together that would be as durable as the current nascar engine
568899 were confident its something we could do in fairly short order maybe not in four to six weeks but probably 12 weeks or half a year turnaround time
568900 when you have more horsepower you can make those tradeoffs
568901 if you can go through the turns better because youve got more horsepower then you can afford to give up speed on the straightaways
568902 fundamentally we knew we were behind with our sb2 engine against their stuff that we would be down on horsepower not that we were behind but that the rules that made us run the sb2 kept us behind
568903 and we suffered the same last year too but the difference this year is now toyota has some great teams and drivers
568904 so weve been lobbying nascar for the better part of a year to let us run our r07 engine in nationwide so that architecturally we would be on the same playing ground as toyota
568905 looking at those dyno tests and look at the average horsepower under the rpm increase over time curve rather that peaks because you race average not peak the best was david reutimanns he finished fifth in the 300 the second best was winner kyle busch
568906 and when kyle did his victory burnout well we know that burnouts are a good way to kill horsepower so the number he ran on the dyno well he was probably really better than reutimann
568907 but based on the tests themselves chevrolet was third best we were 20 horsepower off the toyotas across the power band
568908 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
568909 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
568910 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
568911 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
568912 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
568913 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
568914 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
568915 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
568916 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
568917 we take it very seriously its been dealt with and will continue to be it wont be tolerated
568918 you had to expect something like that was going to happen
568919 thats a pretty big incident on our team and at least now we know what to expect and we can prepare to go into the first two games with him out of the lineup im not going to say it wont have an impact but if this would have happened wednesday before we went to san diego it would have a bigger impact than it will now
568920 steve understands he made a mistake and im confident he is going to react well to this
568921 i know hes going to work toward not making that mistake again there are no certainties in life and especially in this business but hes a good person and he cares about the team and hes going to work at what he needs to work at
568922 we doubled the suspension from 02 and it was equal to the suspension for jeremy bridges theres no exact science to this thing you have to determine whats fair because if you go beyond fair you dont know what holds up the intention here is to be fair and do whats right for the team and we felt like two games is that number
568923 im sure there will be some people upset and rightfully so and i assure you steve knows it
568924 but he will be accepted i dont think theres any doubt i have a couple of kids you get mad at your kid and you just cant understand why they would do something but you dont love them any less and thats how we feel about steve it was an unfortunate incident had it been the other way around and another player done it we would feel the same way but hes ours and im glad hes ours
568925 this is when youve got to have the right guys in the locker room being a leader im embracing that fact and i know muhsin muhammads embracing that fact and i know jon beason and chris harris are embracing that fact too and we are spreading it amongst ourselves
568926 this will not divide this football team theres going to be pitfalls throughout the season its a roller coaster ride youd like for it to be a kiddy roller coaster ride but how you react to adversity thats the biggest thing
568927 hes in great mental spirits mentally and physically it could have been worse not that a broken nose isnt bad enough but well treat it as we go
568928 i think we have a chance to be a real good defensive football team
568929 we do have the potential to be good which doesnt mean nothing
568930 were just trying to get better every day so that at the end of the season when they look back on it they can say well that was the best defense wake forest has ever had
568931 i dont want to hear it right now i want to hear it come jan 8
568932 i always feel good when weve got more veteran guys back on the defensive side of the ball
568933 i really dont think weve got a lazy group sometimes guys that have been around a long time take too much for granted they kind of assume theyre going to be good and they dont do the work necessary to be good
568934 but i feel like just in talking to the guys that weve got a pretty mature group of guys on defense
568935 the whole mood of the off season when we were working out was weve got to get better weve got to get better
568936 last year was not good enough theres always room for improvement there was a missed tackle or a fumble on the ground that we didnt get or a third down conversion that they got
568937 theres a lot we need to work on as a team and the players to a man we all know we have our faults
568938 coach lambert and coach hood were on the same page with a lot of things as far as the game plan goes
568939 so i dont think you should see anything different in our defensive schemes and stuff like that
568940 as you know all of our stuff is in house its not like we brought an outside guy in so weve got all the tools in place
568941 weve got the same tool box and weve got even better tools now
568942 we had an awesome dodge charger back in june here at pocono
568943 i hope that we can run well again this weekend its going to be a real battle to make it in the chase these next six races so its real important to run consistent and stay up front
568944 thats the main goal thats what all the teams want to do for their sponsors and owners and the employees that work on these cars
568945 out of the 14 drivers going for the chase i think that we have as good a shot as anyone from sixth on back
568946 we have some different people in place at gillett evernham motorsports and we have a better starting point this year
568947 i think we have a great test team that does a lot for our team now i feel that everything that they work on is much better than last year
568948 the patch in turn three doesnt have as much grip as it did when we were here before
568949 its easy to slip off the top of it and get too high now which it looks like a lot of people figured out because there are a lot of marks above the patch
568950 its the same racetrack just a little bit slower and a little bit later in the year those are the things that you have to get right again on sunday to win the race
568951 last week was unfortunate but thats what it was and im sure that it wont happen again
568952 i think that we had a really good tire that goodyear brought here for the first race its the same one that we have again this weekend
568953 i look forward to being able to have some green flag stops its a good strong durable racy tire and im looking forward to that
568954 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
568955 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
568956 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
568957 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
568958 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
568959 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
568960 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
568961 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
568962 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
568963 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
568964 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
568965 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
568966 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
568967 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries
568968 there are tiny shiny moments almost too small to be seen
568969 mystery the house that george built with a little help from irving cole and a crew of about fifty paperback newly tagged
568970 prime minister gilani said that he would conduct an independent investigation
568971 he said he would look into the matter and try and get to the root of it
568972 so the two prime ministers naturally reviewed where we are in the process of normalising an improving india pak relations
568973 the indian prime minister was relatively frank in expressing his concerns about recent events which have had an impact on the relationship and on the prospects of the dialogue
568974 both sides expressed the determination that we need to overcome these events and to move back on to the track of improving relations
568975 it was a candid and open conversation between two people who both wanted to see a way forward in this situation
568976 you do have a stigma associated with the extended guarantee
568977 whatever time they miss is valuable because theyre rookies as you know
568978 but the good part is that the other guys are going to have to play and they have to be evaluated
568979 when you get older you start to wonder have i just lost my mojo
568980 i dont know too many other ways i can change
568981 i dont want to get him in trouble but its a broadcaster who should be in the hall of fame but hes not
568982 the pressure is on them to keep winning and stay in first in 2006 i dont think we were in first until the last day of the season
568983 it helps just to be comfortable knowing that if you have a bad night you have a chance to go back out there the next day and improve on the mistakes you made the previous night
568984 he comes to the game knowing what hes going to do and he does it he has a plan
568985 you watch him now and he trusts what hes doing
568986 he trusts that he can cut the ball lose get extension and finish pitches and its not going to hurt
568987 i just slowed down a little bit and let her play more aggressive it was my mistake to let her back into the match
568988 i wanted to get to 20 under and i did that now ill have to reset my goals
568989 i did a good job of getting the ball in play you can score from the fairway here
568990 i kept going and tried to make some birdies you never know
568991 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
568992 when comparing the most advanced mortals in mind and soul condition they are not equal to us in development this makes me wonder what improvement could be made in our condition in order for us to progress should we enter into another mortal body yet strangely we cling to our old belief in reincarnation and congregate together waiting for something that must happen in order for reincarnation to become the destiny of our souls
568993 i dont know anything about french but i do know that i am bothered to death by spirits
568994 when i reached the spirit world i found such glory and happiness and beauty that i now realize this little earth is a grammar school not a university or even a high school it is only the first lesson of life
568995 you can learn in one day here what takes years to learn on earth forget reincarnation because it is a sandbag around your neck you will have it so centered on your mind that you will think of nothing else and you will stay just where you are you cannot progress because your mind will always revert to the earth again you cannot live on the earth more than once life is progression not retrogression
568996 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
568997 if reincarnation were true there must have been millions of spiritualists who upon entering the other world have sought in vain their kindred children and friends has one whisper of such a woe ever reached us from the thousands of communicating spirits never
568998 take the chair in front of us and try not to be nervous

569026 kenapa kita menganggap semua bisa menjadi simple dan selalu ada jalan keluar pernahkan kita mikir kalo kata2 itu salah dan harusnya diganti dengan jalan masuk gimana kita bisa nyelesaiin sesuatu kalo cuma nyari yang keluar tapi gak ada yang masuk kecil memang keliatannya tapi sebenarnya ada banyak hal yang kurang dr 1 bisa mempengaruhi hidup kita tapi kalo kita gak nganggap yang kurang dari 1 itu gak penting buat apa kita hidup krn hidup kita juga merupakan gabungan hal2 yang kurang dr 1 yang kita anggap gak penting masih mau dikeluarin kenapa gak dimasukin krn gak ada hal sekecil apapun diciptakan tanpa kesan yg luar biasa krn dengan melakukan hal kurang dr 1 kita udah melakukan hal yang luar biasa dari hal yang lebih luar biasa

569031 i am still trying to find my own blogging language
569032 casey has the key to this casey was the last person to be seen with the child and we still believe that casey knows more than what shes telling us and shes the only one who can tell us something that can turn this around
569033 i said whatever i needed to do to get the authorities to come help me
569034 i worked on whatever i could to get them out there so im not a liar i just stretched the truth a little bit the car wasnt where it was supposed to be so i said it was stolen because i didnt have any reason to come to my house that doesnt make me a liar or a murderer and that doesnt make my daughter either just because she had some mistruths
569035 we truly believe she has info that could help us find her little daughter
569036 i honestly can say weve had other cases that made the national media but i dont recall anything more than this its something thats been phenomenal unbelievable
569037 keep in mind we have a whole unit and also have civilian personnel taking down tips and turning them over to police
569038 nothing much to buy so i merely asked for a treat from the boyfriend
569039 we have been in this building for 30 years and in business in berkeley for 37 years but the building is being sold and we are in a kind of a strange situation we are not in a lease right now and we are also pushing the boundaries for the building the owner is selling the building and doesnt want a long term lease in place
569040 this is a great old building we started out as a tiny bookstore in a 500 square foot space and have grown to 20 000 square foot
569041 at first we felt a little pressure to move but we found there was not much action on buying the property so we are taking things at a leisurely pace
569042 we have only seen a couple of buildings in oakland and we havent seen one in berkeley that made sense we are looking for a facility that is big enough and affordable and there doesnt seem to be too many of those available in the city we really like being in berkeley and want to stay here but chances are less than half that we will be in berkeley
569043 of course we could be forced out someone could buy it and give us a a 30 day notice but we are in a good relationship with the current landlords and hopefully that wont happen
569044 possibly thats why the owner wants to sell it or maybe they were at that point in their life when they just decided to sell
569045 you are on the computer more than anyone i know
569046 you read about the brain about marketing about ethics about creativity but you dont ever read any great literature
569047 what he did was the greatest olympic performance of all time
569048 im looking to do something different that the sport has never seen
569049 ive been swimming well ive been feeling good in the water
569050 she accepts the fact that the testing was properly done and the results properly reported
569051 i decided i should try the next level to see how i could do i went to the lpga q school a few times and kept missing out i try to play in some open events just to keep competitive
569052 i havent played in a tournament since 2004 ive been around the game im teaching at the arizona biltmore but i havent played any competition i do pro ams and corporate clinics
569053 part of it was i got sick i decided to just take a break the biggest thing is my daughters sarah and heidi are both in college now i think i feel i have the time and i feel relaxed enough that i can go out there and play i havent practiced at all
569054 but my partner is playing really good i hit some good shots too i made a couple of birdie putts but val is playing great cw2
569055 you feel like its a true olympic event everybody is supporting you and they want you to succeed
569056 if you put yourself in a rolling desk chair and try to play it takes a lot of maneuvering of the body and stretching along with eye hand coordination
569057 its amazing what the games can do for your psyche especially for newly injured individuals
569058 the games were an opportunity to travel and do something that ive never done before in my life even when i was able bodied
569059 having been in the military there is a camaraderie of veterans and military personnel that i have yet to find anyway else it turned into one of the best experineces ive had in my life
569060 ive been paralyzed for 11 and a half years but have been to 12 games
569061 thats how i felt when i came in as a rookie i wanted to prove and show that i was a no 1 guy and thats how i feel now
569062 i dont know we dont use numbers it was a great deal of pain
569063 the reason why you dont complain is because thats what the games about theres going to be nicks and bruises youre not the only one going out there with an injury theres no sense in discussing it
569064 its not hard to keep it to yourself when you put everything into perspective
569065 at the end of the day whether things are going good or bad you know inside you know whats going on it would have been wasted time wasted thinking on my part to sit there and tell people i had to put so much focus into getting myself to whatever percent to be healthy enough to play each game i didnt have time to think about who was criticizing me
569066 but youve got to do what youve got to do to make sure you put a good performance out there on the field i feel 100 percent and ready to go if i wasnt 100 percent i wouldnt be out there i was out there doing my job and trying to get everything together and make sure i was executing the right play
569067 the first thing is to get into shape and getting used to those balls being thrown and put them away
569068 everything i could be there for i was there for i was just working as hard as i could to get better mentally and physically
569069 the only time people do water sports is usually when theyre skating on it
569070 a lot of my friends from bc high played hockey so its frozen water but i have enormous pride in coming from boston as a lot of people do its huge a lot of people from boston talk a lot about the city and thats how i feel im going to the olympics but i still have close ties to the area that im representing
569071 i decided to come back and give it one more try it was my ultimate goal although im a little surprised at what event im competing in my goal is to walk away from the olympics with a gold and the u s are huge favorites so to have that opportunity to go for it is pretty amazing as it is to go back to the olympics for a third time
569072 i can look back and say i just have to chalk it up to it not being my day it just wasnt there
569073 the way im looking at it now is that i may have missed in my favorite event but i still made it im in san francisco boarding a plane for singapore and ultimately beijing and most people would kill to be in my position
569074 ive never been more confident i swam my best time in the 200 in the trials and that put me on team
569075 i found out about three weeks ago that i was elected team captain and the responsibility is unbelievable
569076 i think we arguably have one of the great teams in u s history and its something special
569077 the special thing is how close the team has bonded i think were really destined for good things its a great opportunity to go down in history as one of the best teams on the relay you realize theres a team in the pool you dont want to let down and a country back home you dont want to let down
569078 the training has been going great although its a little different focusing on 4 x 200 relay but every time i look at the architecture of the water cube beijings olympic acquatics venue i get so excited
569079 more often than not its going to be my last olympics and ive been trying to soak up every olympic moment
569080 as i stand here today i feel like a man standing on the north pole
569081 the only way to go from here is south i shall cherish this moment for the rest of my life
569082 of all the players i watched and rooted for during that time i can say without a doubt that andre tippett was the most dominant defender at his position the patriots ever had and one of the greatest ever to play the game
569083 andre possessed the perfect combination of size strength speed and athleticism in his prime andre was probably the most intimidating player in the game i cant think of a higher compliment for a linebacker
569084 he taught us to honor and be proud of our names
569085 he always used to say rob me of my money and you have nothing but rob me of my name and you take my most prized possession
569086 i was lucky to marry into a warm loving and accepting family
569087 the popularity of the patriots began when they started winning super bowls
569088 lets face it everyone loves a winner and one of the biggest reasons for that was when bob kraft became owner of the team if ever theres an owner who should be elected into the hall of fame its him he turned that organization around hes a great manager not only at hiring coaches but he kept the best players on the team if you look back at previous owners when they had a player who was great to the point of demanding a higher salary they would trade them
569089 leon grays trade to houston was devastating to our offensive line
569090 i thought leon was such a great offensive tackle and one of those guys who has been overlooked for the hall of fame he was unquestionably one of the best ever when leon got traded to houston i used to love going to the pro bowl so i could see him
569091 owners have a lot to do with building a winning team
569092 they can keep the players they need to keep keep quality players on the team rather than making money by cutting the budget they find ways to make money by producing a champion thats what bob kraft has been able to do very very well
569093 the success of the current patriots has put the spotlight back on us bob kraft has orchestrated that a little bit he tries to build a tradition around the current team he has built the new museum which houses a hall of fame for the
569094 what he has done is he has an understanding of how that team was built and the great players that built the fan base that allowed him to come in and build off of that hes been great in that regard helping the retired players hats off to him for what he has done
569095 this is a win for the patient who has been brushed aside by the doctors and the system
569096 this corrects the law for a whole population of people who never had a day in court
569097 its going to make it more difficult to defend these cases
569098 its clearly going to take a lot longer for jurors to reach a decision than it did before if they decide there is a loss of chance the formula is relatively detailed and it will cause a great deal of time and consternation among jurors trying to figure it out
569099 in case you were wondering my guitar is acoustic but plugged in
569100 its football season im trying to put everything behind me and concentrate on the season its a good thing i was supported by a great organization
569101 my teammates were all behind me my family my wife but its time to focus on the season now and put everything behind me
569102 all i can say is that they were really supportive of me
569103 thats reflective of what kind of organization they are they really help their teammates out thats nice
569104 im just trying to move on and get past that
569105 it felt good to get back with the team and help out
569106 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
569107 you bet your life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
569108 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
569109 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
569110 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
569111 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
569112 im a long way from being troy brown you cant even make that comparison at this point
569113 i have a lot to learn still on both sides of the ball
569114 im grateful for the opportunity to work both sides of the ball and the coaches are giving me the chance to show what i can do
569115 im trying to learn from the experienced veterans and the great players around me on both sides of the ball
569116 they always preach about doing more and the more you can do the better
569117 im grateful for the opportunity to be able to work both sides but i have a lot of learning to do
569118 then coach jags grabbed me again and this time i knew what he was going to tell me he told me that i was ineligible
569119 he told me that in the recent history it wasnt necessarily my fault but he told me the most honest thing he could have he told me that if i dont take care of my business dont expect anybody else to take care of it for me i understood exactly what he meant then i just went down to the locker room and just started crying it was crazy i saw matt ryan and i saw gosder cherilus and those guys and they just told me to keep my head up but it was a real rough time
569120 in a situation like that im mature enough to say yeah i messed up in the past
569121 but if you look at the situation in its entirety i messed up the fall of my junior year when they put me on track i did everything they asked me to do get to where i needed to get to a year from that all i could do was what they asked me to do and it still wasnt good enough but overall it was my fault because i put myself in that predicament
569122 since hed been a teenager id never seen him cry we were up there that day for the game and we were walking him to the car so we could go to our hotel so we could sit down and talk and he just fell over on me and started crying his father and i did our best to comfort him and after we went to the hotel and talked and we encouraged him and told him that things would work out for him
569123 b j did and we did too we still love boston college were just hoping that all will go well for him
569124 unmark as the weekly source code 31 single instance winforms and microsoft
569125 its the first time ive heard of having to rescue an animal from a roof
569126 it would have been a difficult situation because you cant know how the sheep is going to behave in those circumstances and obviously it took the wrong course of action
569127 back in 04 the olympic teams performance in athens left a great deal to be desired
569128 i had no idea at that moment that i would be asked if i would consider taking over the program but i did have a prerequisite full autonomy
569129 i was aware of how things were structured in the past and i felt we needed to change the culture
569130 with this program weve asked them to be committed to playing for their country and not just to play
569131 these guys have done that over the last two years weve seen this program develop to where whether it be lebron james kobe bryant or jason kidd they feel like theyre part of a team part of a movement and theyre very proud to represent the united states
569132 i think in some respects over the years weve been pretty arrogant saying its our game its not our game its the worlds game and the respect weve shown to international basketball over the last two years will pay dividends
569133 when were with our teams we complain i wish i had chris paul in the backcourt or i wish i had dwight howard
569134 i want this guy i want that guy because we all want to win
569135 well everyone is in the room everyone is here theres no excuses now we have to get the job done
569136 obviously the most talented team without a question in the world
569137 ive learned a lot about these individuals getting to talk with them and look them in the eye
569138 as far as garnett is concerned we never got any positive feedback
569139 it was more about ive been there ive done that its time for someone else to do it
569140 i think we have a unique opportunity right now in representing our country and not just by going for the gold medal in beijing
569141 we can set a standard for how the game should be played right now in our own country with teamwork with camaraderie with enthusiasm with an attention to detail that makes basketball such a great team game
569142 this team is showing all of that hopefully well show it at an even higher level and that will serve as an example for the kids growing up where basketball wont be all about a sound bite or a highlight dunk
569143 trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight
569144 im an underdog probably because im kind of a small guy im shorter than most of the guys out there
569145 even on the ultimate fighter show i was the shortest one i was the lightest one i was the smallest one but nobody will underestimate me because i fight hard and i train hard thats the main plan you want to beat me then you have got to train harder than me i train really hard every day three sometimes five times i put hours into it and i dont care about my weight i just worry about my skills i want to get my boxing going my kickboxing going my jiu jitsu my throwing you know im a complete mma fighter now
569146 for me judo is still the best sport in the world i dont put anything down but thats the way i started and i love judo to death it helped me a lot my base my throws my conditioning my strength my arm strength you know a little bit of everything to be an mma fighter you cant be just one dimensional just be a wrestler or a judo guy and go out there and win some fights you might win a couple of fights but you wont go far so thats why i always make sure i always wrestle with the wrestling team with my good buddies that are olympians but when it comes down to it the spirit of fighting i love it its not only business i love fighting its just a hobby how could you not like fighting its fun to go out there beat somebody up and get paid laughs
569147 when i found out about the ufc i was a big huge fan of it i loved it so this is a dream come true because i wanted to fight in that cage i always loved mma i love the art and its the hardest sport in the world no doubt you cant just be a boxer and do your thing you cant just be a wrestler and just go do your thing you know you have to be a mixed martial arts fighter its a lot of hard training and motivation and you go through a lot im very very very motivated in the sport because i want to be a champion one day and my goal is to win fights and win the whole thing and be a champion in the ufc
569148 rob is a good kick boxer he has a good takedown defense he has good striking he had decent jiu jitsu but well see wherever the fight goes im comfortable with it my training is going good ive got a lot of good wrestling partners to kickboxers to good jiu jitsu guys ive been training with and eddie bravo sometimes too im learning some good stuff from him

569159 home builders are facing an overall economy that is decelerating
569160 lenders suffering from their past sins so to speak are committed to committing fewer sins in the future
569161 we would consider a downgrade if we do not see a near term improvement in home building margins
569162 our financial strength rating for bzh is low the bottom of our five point scale
569163 i dont see how you can try to get rid of someone in a tough environment like this
569164 elevated levels of inventory significant competition in both new and resale markets pricing and concession pressures and consumer confidence levels hindered by economic uncertainty
569165 they got started late in terms of entering the growth phase and buying land

569167 beazer has maintained for months that it has sufficient assets to satisfy the banks but so far that hasnt happened

569169 baby boomers the most affluent generation in history continue to drive demand as they seek second homes and active lifestyle communities

569172 i definitely made a mistake its football season now im trying to put everything behind me and concentrate on the season now
569173 its a good thing i have the support of a great organization and my teammates were all behind me and my family and my wife its just time to focus on the season now and put everything behind me
569174 definitely how could you not be im definitely very thankful for that
569175 thats kind of between me and the team what happened in there is kind of between us
569176 all i can say is that theyre really supportive of me and its a great reflection on what kind of organization were in here they really help their teammates out it was nice
569177 im not going to comment on that im just trying to move on past that and put everything behind me
569178 faucet washers sure right here in this drawer you know we dont get a lot of call for them anymore the way they make kitchen faucets now they last a long time and you cant fix them anyway
569179 my grandfather george when he opened this store everyone thought he was crazy there were no houses brosler said
569180 he started offering paint because he knew how to mix it in those days you had to mix your own paint he found out that he was able to eke out a living
569181 the kid says to me arent you afraid of my gun
569182 were heavy into the service area and we do a huge trade with professionals roy said
569183 a lot of people when they want paint mixed they really dont know what they want they really need someone to walk them through the sale and when they get home and the color doesnt match were here for them if you go to a big box store and you come back with a problem theres another person working and you have to explain the whole situation all over again
569184 when they open up theyve done their homework they already know the top 20 or so of your skus the abbreviation for stock keeping unit the number and bar code assigned to each item the store sells theyll cut the price on those 20 items thats how theyll pound you out
569185 the biggest thing in this business is really the next generation thing
569186 the hours are very long you really have to be willing to work 70 75 hour weeks its very hard to attract the next generation because you hear pop i dont want to work like this thats what a lot of hardware stores suffer from people think were suffering from a lack of business theres plenty of business out there for us but you cant get the next generation to sign up
569187 im 48 i used to think i was the young guy in the business but the truth of the matter is i have a son whos getting ready to go to college and a daughter in high school and if theyre not coming into the business well you can almost set the clock to it
569188 he thought that nobody understood what the show was about on the surface that seems to be a story the old story about the idealist getting corrupted but thats not what its about thats not what oscar meant it to be oscar was talking about the conflict between your responsibility to your community and your responsibility to yourself because of course what happened to oscar is he found he had less time for writing the more he made these public appearances and speeches and traveled around the world
569189 immediate conspiracy to destroy one mans usefulness a conspiracy in which he is usually a willing collaborator
569190 an equivalent story could be told about a lawyer an artist a businessman an engineer anyone who is good at his job
569191 a story like this must of its very nature be built of familiar material there is no novelty in allegro except its style of presentation
569192 most long lasting experimental influence of allegro was scenic oscar had decided to do away with the traditional ways of musical scenery
569193 if men are continuing to squander their time and usefulness for the wrong things it would seem important to point this out to them this is the simple reason why
569194 he would be meek and mild like joe and i are and wear glasses like we do
569195 no one would guess that such a hero was also someone like them
569196 i made steps to do the book when jerry siegel was still alive but i was told jerry doesnt want to be reached
569197 nobleman recalled in a recent phone interview from his home in the cos cob section of greenwich
569198 i dont chase subjects for their themes or potential lessons
569199 if the book does have a lesson its the importance of persistence this is a nice dovetailing with a subject i happen to be passionate about
569200 thats always been a classic contrast with superman being a bit of a goody goody
569201 i was a faithful comic book guy until middle school
569202 then i gave it up because of that stigma that comic books were for losers which doesnt exist anymore
569203 in college i drifted back i only read d c comics now two or three titles a month
569204 i want t bring his story to a larger public
569205 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
569206 on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
569207 for the last six to nine months the economys been teetering on the cusp of a recession
569208 last november december it wouldnt have taken much to blow the economy over the edge now here it is july and nothing much has changed were sort of stuck in a traffic jam and everyone wonders how long are we going to be here
569209 whether its a recession or not its the feeling people have about the economy
569210 ive been on wall street for 21 years i went through the crash of 1987 and the recession of the early 1990s and ive never seen the situation were experiencing now
569211 ask me to make a choice between a soft economic landing and a depression and i may be tending toward a depression
569212 banks were making mortgages that they probably shouldnt have made and people took out mortgages that they shouldnt have taken
569213 now with housing prices falling theres nowhere to fund consumption
569214 the ripple effects of high crude oil have put a squeeze on manufacturers who are forced to increase prices to consumers at a time when consumers have less money to spend because of the costs of gasoline and everything made from petroleum
569215 its difficult for the fed to know what to do
569216 does it raise interest rates and stem inflation or does it again lower rates to try to stimulate the economy i think we may be looking at stagflation
569217 the fed has few options its wrapped up right now trying to save the financial system
569218 the fed in effect has nationalized the american financial system
569219 if gasoline dropped that would break part of the psychology that we talked ourselves into this situation
569220 it sounds unbelievable but its true im still in a daze myself
569221 i thought i would be famous for about a week to 10 days but im getting more attention now than i did then
569222 i gave that all to my mother that was like a fortune to her in the depression to take care of the rent
569223 it looks like the person that shot the victim was on foot
569224 we dont have a good description of the vehicle or anything more
569225 not many people expect someone from the townships to be on the olympic team
569226 the opportunity of being in the olympics is it doesnt get any bigger than this
569227 it is an overwhelming feeling something i have to take with both hands and make the most of
569228 especially root for athletes from countries where just showing up in beijing is a miracle like the zimbabweans and hopefully the iraqis
569229 the olympics tend to mint a different hero in the one you least expect
569230 the magic of the games is that there is a rulon gardner a mary lou retton or a billy mills waiting in the wings
569231 i dont think its right i really dont think its right
569232 this isnt a religious accommodation this is a contractual agreement the majority asked for it
569233 i think its fine i dont have any problem with it theres a whole bunch of them here so theyve got to do something for them
569234 it shouldnt happen i mean i think were in america youre in america i think that they should go with our holidays
569235 if we want to go pray we dont have one for christians
569236 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realised when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimetre piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
569237 i didnt really want that kind of attention but ill always be associated with a lamborghini crash
569238 im an example to people of what not to do especially when youre in a 400 000 car
569239 for one thing it was early in the morning im an adult and i can make my own decisions but one of the things that coach lovie smith preaches is that when youre out that late not too many good things can happen
569240 a lot of people get into car accidents and come out of it in a wheelchair
569241 when i lost control i left it in the hands of god
569242 it didnt take long before i got out i didnt feel any pain at that moment my life was in pause
569243 instead of people wondering if i was ok or not the main question was was he drinking regardless of whether i was drinking or not ive been in a car and ive sped before
569244 ive done so in the daytime its a poor decision no matter what time of the day it is
569245 the way i answered myself to the media it was me being me
569246 i showed i was no different than anybody else im human i make mistakes i got scared i panicked
569247 i thought my career could be over i put pressure on the organization to have to deal with answering questions they werent sure of it put a lot of people in a bind
569248 one of the things that was mentioned in tank johnsons and cedric bensons cases was that they were in situations where they could not mess up again
569249 it is time to sleep i am not going to tell a story enough is enough
569250 i cant go to sleep my mind is still racing
569251 my dad with his son and me with my son
569252 thats my dad i cant be mad at him or try to disown him or anything like that
569253 i dont think thats fair to him he made a bad decision paid the price for it i dont think he needs to come home and face that from me
569254 everything for him was just eye popping it was so good to interact with him we spent the whole day together
569255 thats where every team wants to run the ball right up the middle
569256 he is a live wire a great personality to have around and eats up blockers he does a good job of staying in his gap
569257 we were very pleased with anthony last year and ive noticed he is in a lot better shape at the beginning of this camp too
569258 i think all the different role models i had my mom larry johnson sr an assistant coach at penn state a friend who is a single dad made me respect and honor being a solid guy
569259 i dont want to be that guy who cheats on his wife or has all this drama going on ive seen enough what not to do
569260 i know thatll be very exciting for him and for me
569261 you can add to life whatever you want to add
569262 its about capturing coney islands essence and heritage coney island is one of the most diverse places on earth a place where all socioeconomic groups have been able to meet mingle and have fun
569263 they tell us that they want us to have these things because theyre afraid that their children will throw them away when they die and they want their memories to be preserved
569264 there are a lot of misconceptions about why coney island went downhill in the 1960s 70s and 80s it was not the gangs
569265 to me all the problems were caused by a failed urban renewal project that did not serve the neighborhood but only served developers
569266 i believe the city abandoned coney island in the 60s and 70s allowing it to become a high crime area
569267 the biggest security issue right now as it relates to virtualization is that people dont understand what theyre doing
569268 the virtualization administrator is not a security administrator they cant be because theres too much to learn nor is the virtualization administrator a storage manager and they have to know that as well
569269 some administrators are putting all four of those networks smack tab in their dmz the exposed portion of a corporate network which might contain web and other networked servers when only one should go there
569270 to avoid mixing security policies and preventing things like escalation of privileges some it departments wont allow vm sessions in their dmz to reside on hosts behind the dmz for example
569271 you could have machines that are hived off from other machines and given varying levels of security
569272 s an improvement no need to typical nextel designed phone
569273 what they found was that over half of the women in these fields eventually left their jobs most of them in their mid 30s
569274 what surprised us is theres no lack of love for their careers and theyre not leaving because they dont like their work
569275 theyre leaving because theyre finding the work incompatible with the environment in which they have to work
569276 theyre trained theyre skilled so losing them comes at a huge cost
569277 the way that technology is marketed to them frankly is completely unappealing
569278 computer science has been taught the same way for almost 30 years
569279 we need to stop trying to change the women and realize that it might actually be beneficial if we change the way its taught
569280 the entertainment tv program have singers on stage as well
569281 if you were a nose id pick you to be mine
569282 i was at a club with my girlfriends last week to dance and have a few drinks and the furthest thing from my mind was going home with someone
569283 but then bob came over he was kind of cute but what really got me was his opening line there was enough of a twist to it to amuse me so i let him buy me a drink he turned out to be a pretty funny guy and then one thing led to another
569284 excuse me my friend over there is a little embarrassed shed like your phone number she wants to know where she can get a hold of me in the morning
569285 when i met gary he was the quiet one in a pack of friends trying to impress me and my girlfriends
569286 and they were coming up with the lamest lines you could think of we were all rolling our eyes hoping these losers would find some other victims to pick on
569287 but then gary tapped me on the shoulder and said what has 142 teeth and holds back the incredible hulk my zipper
569288 it was so unexpected and cartoonish that i nearly shot kahl a out of my nose
569289 as we talked further he kept me laughing and i began noticing some attractive things about him like his baby blue eyes before i knew it i was heading back to his place
569290 i have a headache lets go back to your place
569291 tom walked up to me and rather brazenly said hey beautiful if i have your name tattooed on my arm could i take you home and have my way with you
569292 i agreed never thinking id see the name mila on his arm and i didnt he rolled up his sleeve and revealed the words your name on his arm
569293 i just realized this but you look a lot like my next girlfriend boyfriend
569294 if i could rearrange the alphabet id put u and i together
569295 youve been a bad girl boy go to my room
569296 that outfit would look great in a crumpled heap next to my bed
569297 how about breakfast tomorrow should i call you or should i nudge you
569298 hi im mr right someone said you were looking for me
569299 im the one responsible for all those crop circles in england
569300 our faith is present in all our thinking and decisions and the voices of the church is obeyed as the voice of supreme authority
569301 since i was 8 years old ive hoped and dreamed that one day id be able to get one
569302 according to a report microsoft isnt just looking at the next version of windows no not mojave for future os possibilities but is looking beyond the windows architecture altogether with a project known as midori
569303 the midori documents foresee applications running across a multitude of topologies ranging from client server and multi tier deployments to peer to peer at the edge and in the cloud data center

569309 its nothing bad we just want to make sure it doesnt linger throughout the year
569310 the plan is to train and get it to the point where it doesnt hurt any more
569311 and however long that takes it takes i mean it could be anywhere from two weeks to five weeks
569312 last week i was throwing with max hall and dennis pitta and i could only run about five routes and it started bugging me too much
569313 its slowing down im starting to grasp the whole concept of the defense things have started going a little bit better
569314 its been a big jump youre playing with all pro guys guys that have been to the pro bowl super bowls experienced guys so its definitely a learning experience
569315 you have to respect guys like that guys with that level of talent who play like that and play at that high level all the time
569316 you have to respect it and learn from it thats what im trying to do
569317 we knew he had good ability he has a lot of toughness you wouldnt think that a guy from a small school like that would have and he enjoys playing the game and hell mix it up
569318 so thats the surprising thing that you know about him and we like about him i think hes a good young prospect and hes going to do pretty good
569319 you want the truth no im not surprised because he can play
569320 with his size and his speed we knew that he would be somewhere he was determined to get on a roster and get into a camp hes going to be missed i need him this year
569321 at this point in time his experience his consistency the way he goes about his business when rafael furcal went down hes meant so much to the club he brings another dimension his basestealing ability he gives a professional at bat on a regular basis hes done it leading off longer than matt hes willing to take pitches
569322 it was a difficult day but i started poorly and was three over par after five and it was always going to be a struggle to shoot a really good round from there
569323 overall i am reasonably happy because at least i didnt shoot myself out of it and i am only going to be three shots behind going into the last day after the start i had i have to say that i am pleased enough
569324 i had a problem with my neck for two years and then i decided to get my fitness in order
569325 its been an up and down sort of a year now for the first time i feel like i am swinging well peter hanson in the spanish open and then sergio garcia chipped in in so hopefully i can chip in here it would be nice to get a win to get up the rankings and be a bit more comfortable
569326 but they bring it in the tenants bring it in
569327 for the longest time i came home and scratched because i was so jiggy
569328 i still see landlords who dont know they have to hand out that lead certificate
569329 you never know if there is some law out there that is going to get you
569330 i wanted to make sure that as a landlord i was properly following the requirements of the city
569331 it was 10 years of wondering if we were going to have to file for bankruptcy
569332 even really good people fall on hard times and you have to evict them
569333 the myth that all landlords are rich and just drive around collecting rents in fancy cars
569334 it seemed like she thought we are different and we always go out to eat
569335 it is usually the last unit that you are making your money on
569336 if any of your tenants are not paying then you are working for free and nobody wants to work for free
569337 they knew if they screwed up they would be out on the street
569338 it saved my life as a police officer so i guess it is saving my money now as a landlord
569339 ive listened to some landlords complain about their tenants and when you listen to them you can figure out why they are having problems because they dont know how to talk to people
569340 eventually he will get disability you just bite the bullet for a while
569341 there are always those who when it is time for them to pay the back rent they disappear
569342 id say well probably look back in 12 months time and see what a rollercoaster it was
569343 we all fell apart when dad died and i decided that id stay home with mum for a few months
569344 i hadnt been out for months under the circumstances but i went out this particular night to the puck fair with friends my sister jaz had mentioned that there was an italian guy working in nicks restaurant and we were sitting chatting by the river when daniele came along and he joined us as he knew some of the people in the group
569345 l was attracted to antoinette because her smile was so nice and her eyes of course
569346 she is very independent and i loved that about her so it wasnt the case of the classic stereotype of the bold italian man and his prey
569347 i would usually run a mile but i found myself saying that i would like to go out that night which was kind of strange for me but i liked him because he was cheeky but in a funny way i was in a very bad place when we first met but then everything turned around
569348 and i dont know who said what as there wasnt any proposal as such but the next morning we were ringing people telling them we were getting married
569349 we both lead very fast independent lives but were very much together
569350 i was never the type of person that wanted to cook and clean for someone else but our relationship is very even and i love it im not there thinking that id better check that danieles shirts are ironed he does most of the cooking and we bring each other breakfast in bed and hes brilliant with lucia he speaks to her in italian the whole time it was funny that dad always thought id marry a foreigner
569351 so i suppose a nice way of looking at it is that he left and then daniele came
569352 built out of a slinger wing pringles can spare parts yep this is a frankenmig crash sk
569353 so what he called you a n if you cant handle it resign
569354 who would you rather see elected as the next president of the united states
569355 it really upsets me when silly girls get as drunk and aggressive as boys
569356 i think stop this isnt what we meant by feminism its gone completely wrong

569358 to love is to risk not being loved in return to hope is to risk pain to try is to risk failure but risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing
569359 experience is the name every one gives to their mistakes
569360 if you wait to do everything until youre sure its right youll probably never do much of anything
569361 the difference between school and life in school youre taught a lesson and then given a test in life youre given a test that teaches you a lesson
569362 in love it is better to know and be disappointed than to not know and always wonder
569363 the doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live
569364 i put all my genius into my life i put only my talent into my works
569365 to become a spectator of ones own life is to escape the suffering of life
569366 take up one idea make that one idea your life think of it dream of it live on that idea let the brain muscles nerves every part of your body be full of that idea and just leave every other idea alone this is the way to success that is way great spiritual giants are produced
569367 i dont want to live i want to love first and live incidentally
569368 only a life lived for others is a life worth while
569369 sometimes its the smallest decisions that can change your life forever
569370 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away
569371 to laugh often and much to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children to leave the world a better place to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded
569372 the greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do
569373 just talk to him just talk to him about it
569374 over engineered by the new degree for men absolute protection
569375 i cant give you a tab til you order something
569376 kid if you want a pepsi youre gonna pay for it
569377 thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou renewest the face of the earth
569378 for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain tohu he formed it to be inhabited
569379 and darkness was upon the face of the deep the ocean or fluid surface of the earth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness
569380 i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me
569381 well what took you so long come on in and rest a while put up your feet and have a drink by the fire
569382 its a dangerous business frodo going out your door you step onto the road and if you dont keep your feet theres no knowing where you might be swept off to
569383 the invisible remains of a collapsed star with an intense gravitational field from which neither light nor matter can escape
569384 for black folks in a town with jim crow laws
569385 when he was young and had a little more velocity he still had great command with all his pitches thats why he was a perennial cy young award candidate
569386 right now hes adapted and learned what he needs to do with not quite as much fuzz but he still has that uncanny command and is able to change speeds and make pitches we didnt see many pitches over the heart of the plate
569387 hes not trying to attack you in the zone he wants to see how far youll go
569388 he showed that in my first at bat he threw four straight balls all real close he wanted to see where the strike zone was and if i was going to chase he lives on the corners
569389 if you sit back and let him dictate the count and use all his pitches youre going to be down 0 2 and 1 2 a lot
569390 a couple of them were on good pitches and they put good swings on them
569391 the one to betemit wasnt a bad pitch fastball on the outside corner and the one to a rod was right where i wanted it a heater away you have to tip your hat
569392 you try to put someone away you get ahead and they foul a bunch of pitches off
569393 hes trying to get early count outs and sometimes he does but a lot of times he has to work hard for outs i dont think it affects him inning to inning but i think it affects him as the game gets longer
569394 hes thrown a lot of pitches to each hitter not only might he tire a little earlier but these guys have seen a lot of pitches and there are only so many things you can do the third and fourth time around
569395 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
569396 if you have a green party i want to join
569397 the man in the long black coat knocks on your door
569398 a lot of issues that have long confronted low wage workers are now increasingly facing middle income workers
569399 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
569400 i chose oregon because it was the only college that would accept me as a middle linebacker
569401 while dressing for the first practice i thought how strange it was that i was no 75
569402 remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck
569403 the night before the game you get little or no sleep
569404 knowing that if you screw up you will forever be known as the guy who lost the franchise
569405 when gary first asked me to be a presenter my first concern was i was going to have a difficult time explaining how good he really was
569406 offensive linemen get very little attention gary wanted very little of it there was no doubt in my mind he was the mainstay of our offensive line and a major reason why we were able to go and win our first super bowl in 1997
569407 there should be a stage full of guys standing up here receiving this honor with me
569408 i was a huge fan of his because he was the absolute best at what he did and he was quiet about it
569409 too many players in the nfl are too busy running their mouths zimmerman kept his mouth shut and did what he was supposed to i loved that about him
569410 i was wired from the adrenaline i was trying to self evaluate i reviewed so many conversations with other gms i had during the day how could i have handled something differently or said something differently so many elements running through my mind
569411 and then i woke up saturday morning and realized that we werent done
569412 were open to conversation about any player the reality is we cant have any untouchables but it would have to be a huge package in return
569413 at 3 55 p m we had come to the conclusion we were holding on to jason bay because we did not feel the return we were getting was appropriate
569414 then life was breathed into the dodgers red sox deal and because wed put things in place we were able to make a quick decision
569415 it came together in a minute one question two questions and the deal was finalized
569416 nobody wanted to give up the player who has a chance to come back and haunt them
569417 once we felt we had exhausted the ability to get the elite prospect we felt we needed to get more in terms of quantity but still searching for quality
569418 and combined with no rcas adjusting the plan will be difficult
569419 our laws make illegal drug abuse a priority but not legal prescription drug abuse
569420 we dont take it seriously because these drugs are legal
569421 i think i had a reputation for not being a difficult doctor in prescribing medicine
569422 if somebody comes complaining about chronic pain and they need medicine to work are you going to control it to the point where they still have a lot of pain and the ability to work is limited a lot of doctors do that and i have a more flexible view
569423 theres a definite need for doctors to treat chronic pain
569424 if we went away people would be more dependent on buying drugs off the street and illicit activity would probably get worse the problem is that people dont know they can go to legitimate doctors and have pain treated instead of buying medication off the street
569425 she was a patient for four years she had all the records and she was obviously in pain
569426 i had no idea she was selling and it typifies what we have to go through to identify what patients are legitimate
569427 if you take an entire bottle of methadone do five to six lines of cocaine take 80 milligrams of oxycontins drink two quarts of tequila and start doing amphetamines and crystal meth you might overdose
569428 when you take methadone the way doctors prescribe it its so safe its used on pregnant women
569429 he could go around and get any prescription he wanted and no matter how much money he earned he used it for prescription drugs
569430 they have pain clinics right next to probation offices why is that allowed
569431 you dont have to spend a lot of time with each patient youre not doing surgery and youre talking about a very specific group of systems is the pain in your back shoulder etc and then you write a prescription for some pain pills or muscle relaxers
569432 people that lose a loved one are always looking for a reason other than the real reason why the person overdosed
569433 its usually because of personality disorders conflicts unresolved issues arguments
569434 we have to be able to trust the system sometimes within the system people fall down parents dont keep on eye on kids they havent raised their kids right they let them run rampant they dont take them to church or teach them morals they put coca cola in their bottles they enable kids to hang out and not do homework and then the kid turns out to be a drug addict and its the doctors fault
569435 you have to be able to demonstrate that they did this with intent to break a law and thats not an easy thing to do
569436 really its so rare that you would get a kind of tangible evidence
569437 the best doctors can be fooled because people are very savvy and can give you history that is very close to textbook
569438 when you become a pain management doctor youre treating pain and you have to believe the patient theres no other choice
569439 i know it is going to take a lot to get this organized but we have got to open this park on aug 9 the kids are chopping at the bit
569440 we are going to go out and bang on doors and ask people to sign their name with a yes or no vote like a petition
569441 we first need the consensus of the town people from there we come back and go to the next step of talking with the postmaster
569442 yesterday was a good day and the kids learned first aid and were certified in it i think it is great because it doesnt matter what their age is they can still help someone with first aid just because they are little kids doesnt mean they cannot help someone in need
569443 this is a small community town a lot of the officers live in town i think the comfort zone of people growing up with each other helps to foster trust a lot of these officers grew up here or they went to school in union beach these people here have such a strong tie to their community
569444 some very involved and dedicated officers a group of really wonderful parents and some really great kids
569445 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
569446 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
569447 well see if i even want to pursue any type of dialogue with the courier
569448 i think he was more geared toward the kids arts and crafts
569449 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
569450 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
569451 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
569452 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
569453 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
569454 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
569455 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
569456 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
569457 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
569458 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
569459 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
569460 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
569461 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
569462 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
569463 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
569464 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
569465 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
569466 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
569467 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
569468 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
569469 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
569470 not because he is a newcomer and not because he exaggerated his r sum
569471 explain to us the public what he was thinking when he thought that he could pass these falsehoods off as facts
569472 come down with a case of family and career obligations
569473 truthfully im not going to respond to a personal blog
569474 i have no intention of resigning any position my background is solid anybody who would like to see personally can reach out to me
569475 i call this the perfect storm because there are lower revenues from the tax base higher costs to run government losses in state aid and less opportunities to raise revenue
569476 i feel we have been making strides to do shared services for years
569477 there seems to be a consensus that there should be some serious consideration on this method to reduce expenses of the municipality but only small steps first
569478 we are looking at common needs and looking at the high ticket expenses on our budgets to brainstorm on ideas to bring them down
569479 we have got to do this nobody can afford the taxes this year
569480 this is not figured into the budget this year but it if can keep things cheaper in future years it will work
569481 i would like to be the leading county in new jersey in terms of shared services
569482 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
569483 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
569484 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
569485 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
569486 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
569487 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
569488 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
569489 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
569490 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
569491 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
569492 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
569493 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
569494 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
569495 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
569496 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
569497 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
569498 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
569499 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
569500 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
569501 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
569502 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
569503 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
569504 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
569505 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
569506 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
569507 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
569508 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
569509 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
569510 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
569511 o dave theres not much new here other than possibly the catalyst
569512 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
569513 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
569514 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
569515 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
569516 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
569517 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
569518 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
569519 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
569520 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
569521 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
569522 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
569523 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
569524 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
569525 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
569526 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
569527 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
569528 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
569529 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
569530 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
569531 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
569532 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
569533 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
569534 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
569535 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
569536 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
569537 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
569538 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
569539 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
569540 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
569541 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
569542 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
569543 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
569544 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
569545 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
569546 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
569547 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
569548 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
569549 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
569550 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
569551 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
569552 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
569553 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
569554 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
569555 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
569556 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
569557 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
569558 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
569559 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
569560 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
569561 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
569562 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
569563 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
569564 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
569565 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
569566 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
569567 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
569568 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
569569 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
569570 i consider the lack of enthusiasm in seeking comments to be minor compared to the total lack of commitment to actually doing anything useful to mitigate climate change
569571 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
569572 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
569573 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
569574 were not going to do it with the democrats saying well get around to it someday
569575 if none of us have breaking points none of us have a moral compass
569576 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
569577 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
569578 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
569579 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
569580 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
569581 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
569582 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
569583 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
569584 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
569585 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
569586 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
569587 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
569588 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
569589 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
569590 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
569591 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
569592 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
569593 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
569594 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
569595 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
569596 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
569597 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
569598 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
569599 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
569600 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
569601 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
569602 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
569603 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
569604 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
569605 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
569606 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
569607 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
569608 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
569609 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
569610 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
569611 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
569612 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
569613 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
569614 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
569615 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
569616 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
569617 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
569618 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
569619 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
569620 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
569621 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
569622 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
569623 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
569624 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
569625 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
569626 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
569627 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
569628 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
569629 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
569630 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
569631 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
569632 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
569633 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
569634 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
569635 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
569636 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
569637 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
569638 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
569639 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
569640 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
569641 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
569642 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
569643 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
569644 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
569645 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
569646 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
569647 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
569648 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
569649 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
569650 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
569651 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
569652 both penn and bergesen are pitching tonight and they both will be pulled early because we havent decided which one of those guys if any are going to be here so we have to do our homework before that i cant let them both throw 100 pitches and then expect to call them up tuesday to pitch
569653 whats going to go a long way toward determining who pitches tuesday is getting through this series
569654 we need to get through this series in seattle and also be set up with some type of reserve pitching ability out of that bullpen going into anaheim both penn and bergesen are pitching today and were going to make that decision after sundays game
569655 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
569656 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
569657 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
569658 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
569659 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
569660 if the vice president says its do able i believe
569661 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
569662 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
569663 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
569664 nos repugna que de juana est en la calle pero creemos en la ley
569665 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
569666 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
569667 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
569668 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
569669 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
569670 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
569671 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
569672 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
569673 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
569674 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
569675 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
569676 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
569677 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
569678 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
569679 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
569680 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
569681 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
569682 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
569683 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
569684 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
569685 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
569686 i shall never forget walking into cheekwood one of the most beautiful houses in the united states certainly it was nashvilles finest i was mesmerized by the bright yellow taffeta curtains hanging in the clients beautiful drawing room i thought they were magnificent
569687 aubussons tasseled silk curtains and walls painted pale yellow and a ubiquitous murky sage green
569688 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
569689 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
569690 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
569691 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
569692 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
569693 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
569694 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
569695 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
569696 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
569697 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
569698 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
569699 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
569700 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
569701 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
569702 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
569703 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
569704 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
569705 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
569706 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
569707 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
569708 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
569709 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
569710 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
569711 compared to that only 0 01 to 0 5 percent of identities stolen in external data breaches was misused
569712 theyre not interested in setting up a false account under your name they want the hardware so they can make a quick buck
569713 are one of the main tools to pull out data because theyre quick and theyre easy to conceal and use
569714 theres always the fact that theres a human being is at the center of data security and thats going to be a challenge because its not something you can replace with automation or software or hardware
569715 a revolutionary is elected president an alien civilization comes to earth to rescue man from imminent destruction
569716 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
569717 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
569718 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
569719 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
569720 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
569721 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
569722 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
569723 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
569724 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
569725 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
569726 beijing it ought to be welcome news that the international olympic committee has revoked a ban on iraqs participation in the 2008 summer games and allowed some few iraqi athletes to compete in beijing
569727 this is their moment as athletes and not as representatives of political regimes
569728 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
569729 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
569730 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
569731 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
569732 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
569733 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
569734 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
569735 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
569736 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
569737 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
569738 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
569739 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
569740 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
569741 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
569742 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
569743 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
569744 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
569745 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
569746 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
569747 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
569748 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
569749 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
569750 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
569751 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
569752 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
569753 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
569754 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
569755 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
569756 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
569757 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
569758 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
569759 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
569760 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
569761 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
569762 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
569763 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
569764 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
569765 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
569766 we believe that space should be open to anyone and everyone especially those people who want to go
569767 the government has accomplished amazing things but we think that we can do it less expensively
569768 many of us here are interested in space as a hobby or we came from space backgrounds
569769 what i think this prize is really about is inspiring young minds and inspiring the global population to compete for a dream
569770 i liken our teams to the garage bands of the space exploration world
569771 these are the people who have a dream who have a passion who have the knowledge and ability and the drive and they think they can do this so were giving them the opportunity
569772 the craft has to alight on the moon a little like youd expect an insect or a bird to land here on earth and it means that you cant impact or crash into the surface at high speed
569773 i think whats important to keep in mind is that this is an incentive prize and is not meant to cover the costs of development
569774 instead it is meant to be a catalyst to shake up industry and inspire breakthrough
569775 were excited about anyone whos excited about space we dont claim to have a monopoly on exploration
569776 we are absolutely committed to an enduring presence on the moon
569777 if we dont win the prize we will certainly cheer those who do and we will continue with our efforts to provide a permanent established mechanism for humanity to reach the moon in a very frequent and cost effective way
569778 the artificial sweetners that we use today such as apertaine and saccrine have been studied extensively and have not been shown to increase a persons risk of cancer
569779 if consumers come in contact with a pesticide its at a very low concentration add it cannot put that person at increased risk of getting cancer
569780 however farmers in our community who are in contact with high concentrations of pesticides for long period of time should take extra precaution
569781 now many people up to 50 of those diagnosed of cancer are cured
569782 and those who cant be cured surrvive for many years good qualtity of life and again mainly because of very good treatment options we have right here in bismarck
569783 on monday after 200 years the public will again be able to buy whiskey at george washingtons distillery
569784 these commemorative vatted american whiskey sets are a totally unique product available only at mount vernon it represents a union of the great american whiskeys united in the spirit of george washington and i think he would have approved
569785 its wonderful to see so many southern californians enjoying their saturday night in the great park
569786 we look forward to an amazing summer of free music and dance performances and encourage everyone to experience all the great park has to offer
569787 and when the mood is right a burlesque hoola hooping fire performer
569788 alienated classicists and romantic bohemians gypsy music opera klezmer and cabaret come ons mingle like emigres trading aliases at an after hours club its highly cultured with a guttersnipes knowing sneer
569789 ivers presentation was music with the kind of life and spirit that come together when talented artists from different backgrounds find the linkages that connect all forms of music no wonder the audience loved every minute
569790 when we serve others by heightening awareness the result is priceless
569791 ill bet that rap must be really profound when youre high on pot

569798 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
569799 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
569800 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
569801 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

569831 the search for nurin is over and now we will focus on catching the killer and see if the parents had been negligent in looking after her safety
569832 there is an urgent need to come up with more doable steps rather than just talk to impress we have been talking about this for the last 25 years and we are still talking today
569833 but with the increasing cases of neglect it is time to make an example of these people
569834 the anguish of the parent of the missing child will only be compounded by the public scrutiny humiliation and in some cases vilification through trial by media
569835 we must remember that the parents are already victims here

569848 this is aimed at developers looking to deploy across multiple screens looking to leverage the java ubiquity
569849 we are architecting it to the idea of cross device content where developers can build applications to a common api and if you write to that your app is deployable to any device capable of running javafx
569850 we initially thought flash flex would be easier to start with but in the end it was harder to do certain functions
569851 javafx gives us the advantage of tying into those tried and true java apis that are vital to our app so while the tools are lacking they are going to be there
