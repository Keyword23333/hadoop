2080005 italy eased past honduras 3 0 in their olympic opener courtesy of two penalties and a goal from a sensational sebastian giovinco there had been fears over the fitness of villarreal star giuseppe rossi but he was fit to start while overage hitman tommaso rocchi pulled out with a calf problem cagliari striker robert acquafresca stepped in to partner rossi with juventus ace sebastian giovinco playing just behind the front two after just two minutes italy had a glorious chance to make the perfect start to the competition the honduran offside trap failed and giovincos angled ball reached acquafresca who went through on goal but he could only drill his effort straight at goalkeeper kevin hernandez brescia goalkeeper emiliano viviano did well to stop a vicious drive from luis rodas and moments later salvatore bocchetti had to be alert to stop carlos pavon giovinco was on typically inspirational form and his cross found rossi via acquafresca but the ex parma mans header flew over the bar just after the half hour mark giovinco fed acquafresca and the 20 year old surprised everyone by hitting a shot first time from 20 yards forcing hernandez to divert the ball around the post and it was giovinco who broke the deadlock with a beautiful strike from 25 metres that flew in under the bar to set italys campaign alight honduras looked rattled and almost immediately from the restart quiarol arzu used his hand in the box and the referee awarded italy a penalty rossi stepped up and coolly converted past the stationary keeper to make it 2 0 at the break italy started the second period full of confidence and hernandez had to deny rossi after 49 minutes and it was 3 0 from the penalty spot after acquafresca was taken down by keeper hernandez and picked himself up to blast fiercely home rossi was replaced by torino new boy ignazio abate and the substitute immediately had a chance but he was closed down by erick norales luca cigarini brought gasps from the crowd when he blasted a blistering free kick from 35 yards out and it skimmed the bar honduras had their best chance of the game when norales hit from just outside the box but viviano wasnt troubled abate was full of running and his low cross nearly found acquafresca casiraghis men eased off late on and allowed honduras to have the majority of the possession giovinco received a rousing ovation when he was replaced by juventus teammate claudio marchisio with 12 minutes left he had been the azzurris key figure viviano had to make an excellent diving save to deny ramon nunez and a minute later honduras had a penalty emil martinez was clattered clumsily by lorenzo de silvestri but pavon blazed the spot kick over the bar honduras were pushing forward and viviano pushed an effort from former udinese man samuel caballero over the bar but italy took the three points and now face korea on august 10
2080006 giovinco plays at an incredible level hes one of those players who really stand out and can turn a game any time they are out on the pitch he is a future roberto baggio or giancarlo antognoni he has a great future ahead of him and will achieve great things in the italian league

2080015 sen obamas agenda can be summarized as this government is too big he wants to grow it
2080016 taxes are too high he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit

2080022 brown fat is present in mice and in human infants where it keeps them warm by dissipating food energy as heat instead of storing it as white fat
2080023 human adults dont have much brown fat but there is some and from a therapeutic perspective the question is whether that pathway can be reactivated
2080024 these results illustrate that the gene we identified can turn on a broad program of brown fat cell development when we insert it into precursors that otherwise would produce white fat
2080025 you might not have to implant a large amount of engineered precursors in people who are at risk for being obese
2080026 in theory you would only have to reduce the accumulation of white fat by 1 percent or so to have an effect

2080045 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year
2080046 thank you for having the balls to cut through the spin and hype
2080047 oh my god can i come and work for you people
2080048 it is nice to get intellectual about something that really has no bearing on anyones life
2080049 another blog filled with the angry ramblings of the jealous and envious
2080050 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
2080051 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
2080052 how did i ever live without the keen insights and cutting observations of deceiver
2080053 in this tournament the points for the world ranking for me are of less importance
2080054 what we want as a team is to represent our nation in the best possible way by winning medals
2080055 the no 1 ranking is a nice triumph after many years of chasing but we are now at the olympics which is also a terrific experience
2080056 all i want to do is to live this olympic spirit enjoy the people attending and watch the other sports on television
2080057 do not believe that i am invincible the truth is i do not see myself stronger than anybody
2080058 konawicz a graduate student pursuing her masters degree in industrial design at north carolina state university created a fluid flowing design made with a mold similar to mass produced plastic lawn chairs
2080059 a lot of chairs ive seen have been made out of pvc and theyve said it can be made from recycled pvc itself or it can be recycled but really recycling is a whole other process that is not earth friendly you have to go through a lot of energy to get it recycled
2080060 with this process when youre done with the chair it biodegrates into the earth so theres no waste and it doesnt harm the earth at all and i thought that was impressive
2080061 what is with these guys and why cant they get it together
2080062 the change thats really happening is you have to learn how to attract people to your message rather than pushing it at them you have to figure out how youre going to listen when they talk back and you also have to watch what they do those three things are really critical because once you do them you have to figure out how to respond those three things are really critical because once you do them you have to figure out how to respond when i say do it wrong quickly its not you trying to do it wrong its that you kind of admit that what youre doing is probably wrong because it usually is and then you have to look back at the feedback from your target market to see how far off it is so that you know what to do next and thats really a tough change for a lot of marketers that seems really simple but think of it a whole industry has changed in a matter of what less than a decade that is pretty outstanding its going from monologue to dialogue from lecture to conversation from directing to caring from crossed fingers to metrics likewise david meerman scott had this to say a couple of weeks ago at podcamp boston 3 on an edition of the marketing over coffee podcast you truly have to think differently than you ever have before if youve been a marketer or pr person throughout your whole career so many people have an idea of what marketing and public relations is marketing is typically advertising and you interrupt people and you coerce them to do something and pr is you convince a handful of journalists to talk about your stuff everything were talking about here at podcamp boston 3 is about creating something interesting that doesnt talk about your product and service no one cares about your product and service but gets an idea across
2080063 the internet wasnt built for businesses it was built to share information first for the military and later for academics business has grown out of this original purpose but it wasnt the intention

2080097 gatehouse revenues continued to outperform newspaper peers which averaged double digit declines
2080098 my view is that the next several quarters will be extremely challenging and we have not yet reached the bottom
2080099 we are experiencing increasing inflationary pressure particularly with regard to newsprint pricing delivery costs and health care expenses
2080100 we continue to aggressively look for ways to reduce expenses without impacting the quality of news and customer service we provide to our readers and advertisers
2080101 the majority of our revenue declines continue to come from classified advertising local advertising revenue is holding up quite well and our online and circulation revenues continue to grow
2080102 our challenge is to capture this shift with our local web businesses
2080103 the internet is far more of an opportunity than a challenge to gatehouse
2080104 the perception we are overleveraged and possibly in danger of default

2080119 this is a very exciting way to do business with cities agreeing to share water rights
2080120 this makes sense when were talking about a limited resource
2080121 i dont think most people grasp just how big this is
2080122 that two jurisdictions in different watersheds can reach an agreement as amicably as we have its the kind of agreement where each party thinks they got the sweetest end of the deal and thats the best kind

2080131 as these criminals managed to cash out millions of dollars other criminals will follow the pattern we will continue to see this trend in 2009 as well
2080132 the scale of this fraud is quite breathtaking and illustrates the professional approach that these fraudsters take
2080133 it might be all business to them but such a fraud leaves a lot of damage hassle and misery for victims in its wake for companies such as the ones victimized safeguarding their networks and financial and business data has become a top priority
2080134 the criminal insider takes data with the sole purpose of using it often reselling it to third parties
2080135 without examining how vulnerable their data is from insider attacks most companies are leaving critical shortfalls in place that could be costly from both an operational and brand perspective

2080218 wall street failed to anticipate how wide reaching problems with mortgage bonds would spread into seemingly distant corners of the financial markets the report said awash in easy money banks doled out credit without sufficiently charging for the risk wall street also created complex structures that masked connections between asset classes as well as compensation incentives that pushed traders to take risky steps for short term gain the industrys failings have now translated into pain for the broader economy the report said
2080219 in a cover letter to treasury secretary henry m paulson jr the group attributed some of the crisis to human psychology
2080220 the root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and the downside of the cycle is collective human behavior unbridled optimism on the upside and fear bordering on panic on the downside

2080233 to automatically suggest he wont be a big scorer may be a safe assumption but its impossible to predict how he might respond to a leading role with the leafs
2080234 i really like the way hes learned to effectively use his size in some ways just watching him out there he looks a lot like evgeni malkin but i agree that he doesnt have malkins hands to expect that hell carry his scoring exploits from the russian league into the nhl is probably a stretch but i think toronto fans are going to like this kid and i believe new coach ron wilson will really help him adjust to north america and the nhl

2080243 i really truly believe we have the right group of guys in the right areas to get everything out in the open guys talked and steve knew he did wrong
2080244 i think the big thing out of all of it was ken lucas for him to get up here and talk about it i think guys got to release a lot of emotions by listening to ken and feeling how he felt
2080245 but things have gone smooth those are times where you can make or break a team there can be anger and whatnot but there hasnt been any of that i think you see it on the practice field guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign it really and truly is
2080246 i know the question youre saying but when steve came out of his mom he had that edge
2080247 i truly believe that guys feed off steve when steve plays offensively defensively everybody feeds off steve that is just my opinion i know when the lights come on he will still be the same steve
2080248 to me that is innate you either have it or you dont have it i truly believe somebody cant work to get that way you either want it or you dont want it
2080249 i know hes young but hes definitely got leadership ability
2080250 if you didnt know it youd think hed been in the league nine 10 years
2080251 its too nice of a gym and i didnt want to tear it up
2080252 i dont know but i think hell do fine hes going from green bay to new york if anything i think the off the field acclimation will probably be the most different for him but he really stays to himself i dont think hes going to be like a joe namath or anything like that hes a bright guy hes really into his family a country boy playing football hell be fine

2080269 brussels 6 august 2008 ituc online the israeli national trade union centre histadrut and the palestinian general federation of trade unions pgftu both of which are affiliated to the ituc have reached a landmark agreement to protect the rights of palestinian workers employed by israeli employers and to base future relations on negotiations dialogue and joint initiatives to advance fraternity and coexistence between the two peoples the current agreement draws on the terms of an initial 1995 agreement which it had not been possible to fully implement in the intervening years the key features of the agreement include the reimbursement by histadrut to the pgftu of the outstanding balance of union and legal representation fees paid since 1993 by palestinians working for israeli employers the reimbursement is based on a detailed year by year analysis of the fees paid by palestinian workers taking into account funds previously transferred to the pgftu the pgftu will have sole discretion as to how the funds will be spent in line with its constitution in the future at least 50 of the representation fees paid by palestinians working for israeli employers will be transferred to the pgftu to enable both organizations to provide representation legal and other trade union services to the workers

2080647 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
2080648 this is a perilous time and more than ever the world needs a united and strong america if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way

2080690 normal mental reaksjon p at man mister en av sine n re
2080691 men samtidig er det et problem synes jeg at det ligger en forventning om at man aldri skal bli seg selv igjen n r man mister ungen sin man skal v re en s rgende for alltid og det er vi p en m te ogs men ikke utad n er sorgen mer privat f ler jeg og jeg er ikke pen for dele den s mye med andre som jeg var i starten
2080692 ballo er utdannet lege og jeg synes det er rart at han har et s snevert syn p dette med sorg slik som han uttaler seg s synes han mene at det er patologisk v re ute av funksjon mer enn et par dager n r man har mistet noen som sto en n r det er et merkelig synspunkt og enda merkeligere er det n r det kommer fra en lege synes jeg
2080693 hvordan fikk du til forholde deg til det jeg forestiller meg at jeg ville blitt irritert
2080694 som sin partikollega karin andersen vil han i stedet for en sorgdiagnose heller se p om noe kan bli bedre n r det gjelder arbeidstakeres rett til f velferdspermisjon fra jobben
2080695 det enkleste ville v rt si at sorg ikke er en diagnose fordi det er noe helt naturlig men skjellig grunn til sykemelding om vurderingen gj res av en lege
2080696 sorg er en av de tingene hvor folk ikke skal komme lage regler og sette b ser og fortelle hva som er riktig eller galt man m f lov til takle dette p sin egen m te eller s kommer man i hvert fall ikke videre og kan l re seg leve med en ny virkelighet
2080697 jeg synes heller ikke det b r v re noen absolutt tidsbegrensing p en sorgmelding sykmelding for s rgende legene har uansett oppf lgingsrutiner og man f r sjelden sykmelding for s rlig lenge av gangen
2080698 r kelly was very instrumental in making a lot of decisions when it came to my records being played on the radio he would make a call to the radio station or to the label and say hey this joe record is too hot right now yall need to pull that back and they would oblige
2080699 im still very relevant in the game but yeah he did try to make some decisions when it came down to my records being on fire and climbing up the charts and on the radio stations
2080700 he felt like they should pull back because he felt he was more important and with their loyalty to him they obliged

2080752 the stated us mission centers on the training of georgian troops but the georgian military is unlikely to succeed without a us combat role requiring the deployment of special forces and additional us troops an american strategy similar to that in afghanistan may prove successful but before the shooting starts its best to consider what the us also stands to lose america is testing its russian support russias president vladimir putin has been a strong us ally against terrorism and has voiced support for the us mission in georgia yet some russian generals and politicians have balked at having american troops in the caucasus with a base in georgia a complete us military encirclement of russia could be useful if relations become confrontational but those same bases could become a source of confrontation action in the caucasus is unlikely to go as smoothly as it did in afghanistan and aspirations to control caspian oil reserves could backfire the region is rife with instability and us action could set off sparks

2080758 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
2080759 skip caray was one of my favorite people and i enjoyed both his wise personal counsel about the atlanta braves and major league baseball and more frequently his superb commentary on the games
2080760 i lost a good friend and broadcast partner and that is tough for me personally but anybody affiliated with the braves who listened to him or knew him over the last 33 years lost something too he was as important to the braves as any player manager coach or executive theres no way to replace him
2080761 he was the most original broadcaster ive ever been around because hed always come up with things that didnt have to do with baseball
2080762 this has been a really horrible year with all of the injuries and stuff
2080763 this puts it all in perspective we have lost one of the greatest figures in the city of atlantas history
2080764 everybody knew he was a great broadcaster but i will say that he was the best partner in the history of sports broadcasting he was just awesome there might have been some that were just as good but nobody was better
2080765 i thought he was either as talented or more talented than anyone whom ive either worked with or listened to and it sounds very grandiose but he was really talented
2080766 its a tremendous loss to the city of atlanta and to the atlanta braves i mean he loved the atlanta braves he loved being on the job he worked right up until he passed away

2080769 one thing that we noticed right away and it started even before we went on break a little bit was that he was taking a more active approach in the leadership of our team
2080770 and its very evident now i dont mean to make this sound like he was immature but hes really grown up and i think hes become a major player on our offense and i mean that in every regard because we use him on and off the field he helps the young guys as well
2080771 i couldnt answer that exactly how it transpired other than the fact weve seen it its obvious in his approach to the game one thing is it may be more important to him maybe he sees the light that it is his job we have a number of guys that can play and im excited about the way hes come in and the approach hes taken to the game
2080772 you know dwayne i think is each day we try to make steps with him
2080773 some days we feel better than others right now its kind of where it is we need to get to where theres a and he and i have had this conversation so im not uncomfortable talking about it but hes got to get a level of consistency that were all comfortable with including himself
2080774 i dont think theres been a matter of not understanding things i just think its got to happen faster for him
2080775 time will tell on that one quite honestly a lot of that is left in his court he has to control that situation
2080776 i wouldnt say its a lack of desire i cant say that is the case like i say time will tell on this one and hes really got to step up for us

2080830 voters in the 1st district will care more about kratovils promise to raise taxes support wasteful spending and be ally of governor omalleys in washington than the support he has received from a washington democratic endorsement

2080846 i had no idea that where you were born had so much to do with your education process
2080847 at princeton i learned others had not been given the same chances that i had been given in high school
2080848 on the one hand we see the stark realities 13 million kids living below the poverty line who are three grade levels behind those in well off communities
2080849 when kids are given the opportunities they deserve they excel its not that the kids cant do the work no we have simply not given the kids the opportunities they deserve
2080850 one day every child will have opportunity to obtain a good education
2080851 step 1 is to align people who are drawn to the vision
2080852 why arent you challenging people more why are you afraid to set a high bar and ask people to give themselves to it
2080853 ill have to figure how much money i can raise then size the organization accordingly
2080854 leading this organization was requiring so much of you that the only way you could continue to deliver what was required of you was to sleep every other night
2080855 so as far as i can tell you are generating the revolution in american education
2080856 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings the inherent vice of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries

2080863 i realized i needed to get the right people around me and i needed to prepare myself the proper way
2080864 the thing about heath herring is that he not only says hell fight anyone he proves it because he gets in there and does it
2080865 but he kind of always teetered between being a success and mediocrity hed win one hed lose one and he just sometimes struck you as a flabby guy who wasnt particularly dedicated
2080866 hes all of a sudden changed his tune and hes much more serious and focused and dedicated and when heath herring is focused and in shape hes a tough guy for anyone to beat
2080867 obviously given what hes accomplished in his life the guy is a terrific athlete
2080868 but i can do some things in there too there will be two of us in that cage not just brock i do things that brock really hasnt seen before i have prepared so well for this fight and i feel like i have a whole new career thats just starting

2080930 when obama walked on stage at the mccormick center many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so
2080931 during a two minute break halfway through the event which was broadcast live on cnn journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
2080932 this was a convention of journalists not a rally of groupies for obama

2080952 fifty to 60 percent of the injuries occurring in iraq are to the limbs and the average injury requires five surgeries
2080953 myostatin inhibitors are known to improve muscle regeneration and we have evidence that they also increase bone formation we believe these inhibitors will result in a stronger more rapid recovery for these soldiers and other victims of traumatic limb injuries
2080954 is the best approach a single injection bolus that circulates everywhere or just localized delivery
2080955 when you take it away the healed callus that forms at the fracture site has more bone in it
2080956 myostatin also increases fibrosis and scarring within tissue so part of what you are doing is blocking that
2080957 if you can improve muscle healing you can improve bone healing
2080958 young people have a tremendous potential to heal that can be improved with better approaches to preventing infection and to healing soft tissue and bone in an integrated manner
2080959 if we find the primary role of myostatin is very early in the healing process and see a big jump in expression early in a fracture callus it may be that a single injection bolus immediately after injury is the best time for treatment rather than continued treatment over a period of time

2080976 the performance level of bellevues eleventh and twelfth grade students was equal to eighth grade students in the composite of top acheiving countries
2080977 a fair comparison would be to compare whites in america to whites in europe since these groups are genetically similar and to compare asian americans to asians in asian countries

2080998 this is something that will add a landmark to the city that people will admire and bring more grace and value to the area
2080999 it will be used to bring people of all faiths together and facilitate better understanding between the communities it will not just be a mosque but an education centre to educate future nations and generations
2081000 it will be brilliant to have young and old using the centre together there are no plans to use it as a school it will be more of a community centre
2081001 it will give the community the opportunity to interact with muslims and get to know about their culture
2081002 my goal is to never write songs that my fans cant relate to
2081003 like road songs as a 16 year old girl i could never relate to those songs about playing a different city every night i want to write about feelings and love and the lack of love i ask myself ok wheres the song for the 15 year old who just had her heart broken got that ok good now wheres the song for when she falls in love again i like to listen to music thats about life thats what i think my fans like too
2081004 i never ever want to be that kind of artist who writes the same song over and over
2081005 the perfect album for me will always be about having all different beats and syncopations and lyrics
2081006 i end up writing a lot of the songs myself because i get inspired at weird times you cant always have a co writer with you when you get an idea for a song

2081012 bulletin board posts are rather like contributions to a casual conversation the analogy sometimes being drawn with people chatting in a bar which people simply note before moving on they are often uninhibited casual and ill thought out
2081013 those who participate know this and expect a certain amount of repartee or give and take
2081014 when considered in the context of defamation law therefore communications of this kind are much more akin to slanders than to the usual more permanent kind of communications found in libel actions
2081015 people do not often take a thread and go through it as a whole like a newspaper article they tend to read the remarks make their own contributions if they feel inclined and think no more about it
2081016 i would not suggest for a moment that blogging cannot ever form the basis of a legitimate libel claim

2081023 there are zero decent church bodies within 25 miles of me and within 50 miles of my parents and they want to start another church in atlanta what the heck

2081026 the key issue that has plagued money markets is the continued high level of borrowing rates
2081027 this time last year no one could have imagined the levels they are at now weve seen a fundamental reassessment of risk in this new world of tighter credit

2081171 flogging can be an intense physical and emotional experience where trust is paramount for all parties involved the energy given off during a good flogging is palpable you can feed off of it yet it can consume you as well personally i wont administer a torment that i havent already suffered through so that i get a full respect and understanding of the practice not just the technique when flogging someone you must be tuned in to them to anticipate where their head space is what limits their body and psyche can take the dangers of flogging arent just skin deep though you can cause severe injuries and wounds a flogging can conjure a myriad emotions and thoughts from the bottoms own mind this adds to the experience yet sometimes it can force unwanted memories or urges to the surface and you must be prepared to handle this with proper after care for me deciding on which flogger to use is the last of my concerns when preparing myself for a session my passion is more intent on the full spectrum of the mind body and emotions of my play partner do i want to tear him down with the flogging or do i want the flogging to be a tiny extension of my mental bondage over him and tear him down from the inside out another of my favorite uses for flogging is while inducing pleasure as they reach orgasm as personally i love to associate pain and pleasure just call me well rounded

2081177 theres been a lot of interest in leptin as a means to curb appetite and reduce weight but clinical trials have had disappointing results our studies suggest an approach that should be further studied is one that disrupts the interaction between leptin and crp thereby restoring leptins ability for signaling we need to better understand how this interaction works and investigate the underlying mechanisms involved
2081178 we know that crp binds to leptin and this impairs its signaling but we dont know how this is so it may be that the coupling of the two makes crossing the blood brain barrier difficult or it may be that as a package it cant bind to leptin receptors in the brain

2081238 this prompt action by the epa to uphold the rfs is the right policy for the country and south dakota gasoline blended with ethanol reduces our dependence on foreign sources of oil we should not sacrifice energy reforms to expand big oils bottom line at a time when fuel prices have skyrocketed
2081239 in 2007 we made strong improvements to our energy policy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil todays decision by the epa administrator is a strong step toward implementing better energy policy that will benefit consumers today and in the coming years
2081240 the announcement made by the epa today affirms the role an aggressive rfs plays in building a bridge to advanced biofuels and ultimately enhancing our energy security
2081241 given that biofuels are helping make america more energy independent and that studies show biofuels are helping to keep gas prices lower than they otherwise would be its clear that our commitment to renewable fuels must not waver
2081242 determined that the weight of all of the evidence indicates that implementation of the rfs would have no significant impact in the relevant time frame the 2008 2009 corn season and the most likely result is that a waiver would have no impact on ethanol production volumes in the relevant time frame and therefore no impact on corn food or fuel prices
2081243 with americans already suffering record gas prices at the pump pushing the price up further makes no sense at all in the short term
2081244 the underlying force driving changes in the agriculture industry along with the economy as a whole is overall higher energy costs evidenced by 100 per barrel oil

2081581 with the sim s the hardcore players brought it home because they thought it looked cool and after a few weeks they went on to play half life and other games
2081582 but the sims sat in the house and attracted wives and girlfriends and non gamers and it transmitted over to that group once it traveled over to this group it was almost like a sexually transmitted disease it just spread all over the place and the numbers just went up and we ended up with over 50 percent female players which was unheard of for a computer game
2081583 going to certain sides and everything thats what were working on right now
2081584 the whole explosiveness some of that stuff is kind of limited because of my toe

2081588 hes progressing just fine hes getting plenty of reps hes in all the meetings
2081589 you get the calls faster and it gives you more chance to think about it and talk about it with other guys and make sure you are on the same page
2081590 yeah there is a little glitch in it because it times out after 15 seconds and the play clock is 35 seconds
2081591 so the offense can wait 15 seconds and call their play and then you have to get hand signals from the sidelines anyway
2081592 our medical people and i say this all the time do a fantastic job they do a good job with our players in rehabbing they do a great job in every area and heat is one of them we are set up very well for it and we take steps as far as getting them out of the heat getting them cooled off and giving them plenty of fluids head athletic trainer ryan vermillion and his staff do a fantastic job

2081660 they are not accusing pakistan they are stating a fact
2081661 there is evidence not only by our intelligence service but also by our partners who are operating in afghanistan there is clear evidence of isi involvement in the bombing of the embassy
2081662 isi is an intelligence agency with limited wisdom it is wrong to work with an extremist group it is completely wrong to work with a suicide bomber that would go into the indian embassy and consider india a bigger enemy than terrorism and extremism the real threat to stability to peace to prosperity of pakistan of afghanistan and the region is extremism this will have implications of course of rising tensions between india and pakistan and thats something we would like to avoid we really need to work together in the region to overcome the threat of extremism and terrorism
2081663 we and our allies have evidence from the scene and beyond that unfortunately indicates a hand like that is responsible we are fairly confident
2081664 seems to be a rather broadly shared point of view
2081665 its the same thing that the cia told the new york times its not something that would be considered very surprising in the region
2081666 it is important that our foreign partners help us build the capacity of the afghan security forces
2081667 this is the most sustainable the most economical way of defending afghanistan the region and hopefully the world against the threat of international terrorism
2081668 certainly the current level of the security forces combined afghan u s nato and international is not adequate to overcome the current security challenges we are facing in afghanistan
2081669 the short term security solution is to increase the number and the capacity and the quality of the international troops
2081670 we appreciate when our friends are giving us frank assessments
2081671 on the other hand we should not dramatize these issues we have heard in the past about the talibans spring offensives that will wipe out everything or they will be overrunning some major cities issues of that nature
2081672 we are facing the issue of coordination between these different countries different institutions who are coming in with different degrees of commitment different types of commitment constrained by their own constitutions or still facing the issue of national caveats
2081673 the next administration will be a lot more committed to assist afghanistan
2081674 and will be facing the tremendously serious challenge of what to do in pakistan and these two questions these two issues are connected there will be no peace and stability in afghanistan unless pakistan really properly and sincerely works with us and the international community

2081722 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
2081723 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
2081724 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
2081725 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american

2081817 thats been a recipe for coups all across the arab world
2081818 the changes that are going on in iraq and have broken iraqi politics wide open in ways i dont think have really been grasped on this side of the atlantic
2081819 iraqis are desperate for change they are looking for new political parties there are all kinds of new developments going on inside of iraq and iraqis are looking for these elections to start moving them in the direction of a new politics and the elections really do have the chance to bring that about

2081825 but that says more about us and less about the situation on the ground in afghanistan

2081828 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2081829 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2081830 hell have to have someone write the entire thing for him

2081843 but when things get really bad theres often an opportunity for change i dont rule out the possibility of some major reforms
2081844 it doesnt really matter whos president the democrats in congress will basically have their way
2081845 as a result of the polarization that bush created the democrats are much more unified
2081846 an obama administration is going to have a lot of support across the board for a fairly radical shift on iraq
2081847 rectification will take four to six years at a minimum accomplishment of something novel may prove not only politically but economically impossible
2081848 the pendulum will swing back the other way just not dramatically
2081849 whether that was the responsibility of the bush administration wouldnt matter
2081850 the great depression is a hell of a price to pay for real reform

2081888 keputusan spr menetapkan tarikh mengundi pada 26 ogos boleh menjejaskan kedatangan pengundi pada hari tersebut saya rasa tujuan tarikh itu dipilih adalah kerana sengaja mahu menyusahkan pengundi dan kerana itu kami keadilan menyelar tindakan spr berkenaan
2081889 sudah pastinya senario yang dihadapi ialah pertarungan sengit akan berlaku di permatang pauh tetapi pakatan rakyat yakin akan memperolehi kemenangan
2081890 saya sangat kecewa dan mempersoalkan kenapa spr memilih selasa 26 ogos iaitu pada hari bekerja untuk pilihan raya kecil di permatang pauh sedangkan sebelum ini tidak pernah berlaku sama ada dalam pilihan raya umum ataupun dalam pilihan raya kecil yang mana hari mengundi ditetapkan pada hari sabtu
2081891 sudah tentu tarikh ini memberikan kesulitan terutamanya bagi pekerja kilang kerajaan dan swasta kerana masa mereka sangat terhad iaitu hanya pada waktu rehat sahaja ada di antara pengundi yang bekerja di pulau di georgetown tetapi mereka sebenarnya pengundi dan penduduk yang menetap yang tinggal di permatang pauh tak mungkin mereka mengambil masa rehat yang pendek itu untuk mengundi tidak adil bagi mereka pula yang terpaksa mengorbankan cuti tahunan sedangkan spr sepatutnya boleh memilih hari sabtu atau ahad untuk pilihan raya ini
2081892 seharusnya pihak suhakam yang bertanggungjawab terhadap hak asasi harus memanggil dan mengarahkan pihak spr supaya memperbetulkan dan meminda tarikh itu kepada sabtu atau ahad
2081893 saya minta pengamal undang undang dalam pakatan rakyat melihat sudut perundangan berkaitan hak asasi manusia termasuk bersih bahawa apakah ada ruang proses tindakan undang undang terhadap perbuatan menafikan hak untuk orang mengundi

2081925 under the law the bush administration are guilty of murder for the deaths of over 4 000 young american soldiers and lets not forget the over 100 000 innocent iraqi men women and children and babies who have died horrible violent deaths
2081926 whether its called the power to remove these are impeachment hearings
2081927 what were here for is something called impeachment lite were sort of in that never neverland of accusing the president of impeachable offenses but not taking actions to impeach him which i guess impugns but does not impeach him but maybe it has the same effect in the court of public opinion
2081928 if lying about consensual sexual activity fits the bill for impeachment then certainly lying to the american people about the reason for invading iraq qualifies as an official excuse me as an impeachable offense
2081929 im not so sure he shouldnt be impeached or recalled whichever is swifter for doing that

2081986 the most economic way to achieve curb appeal is by refining your landscaping at the front of your house and by making sure the front door is the focal point guests buyers and appraisers will take notice of the entry experience and homeowners sellers need to establish that emotional connection from the moment they pull up to your home remember the details trim weeds fix broken screens hide the trash cans from view and plant some fresh flowers in prominent planters
2081987 the biggest transformation in the shortest period of time results from paint it can lighten a room create an accent wall and provide flow from one space to another
2081988 if you cant afford new lighting or higher ceilings try painting a neutral color on the walls and a shade lighter on the ceiling
2081989 to give a room a focal point or create more drama around one wall try your hand at some color by painting it a shade of chocolate or charcoal to achieve a designers touch
2081990 if you cant afford to remodel the entire house and change your floor plan to make each room transition smoothly try using the same shade of paint in all the public areas and down hallways consistency of tone adds a feeling of congruency and openness
2081991 invest time and money into updating kitchens and bathrooms but it doesnt mean ripping it all out and starting over you can enhance what is already there learn to distract buyers eyes from that which is not perfect by directing them towards areas that have been completely updated a coat of paint and new hardware on existing cabinets and bathroom vanities can instantly update dated countertops tiles and fixtures take it one step further by using epoxy over existing tile or regrout to avoid demolishing and installing new tile which saves time and money
2081992 stick with the timeless tried and true paint colors accessories and furniture in order to maximize the length of time and enjoyment out of your investment paramount to this is how you maintain your home there is nothing like clutter to bury a homes value if a professional cant see the space appreciate the finishes or easily navigate around personal belongings and oversized furniture they cant appraise it or sell it for top dollar

2081999 does that mean youll stop posting p s its interesting youre so anti purees for babies but youll puree up veggies to hide them from your own family nice that you have consistent logic give your baby one new food at a time and wait at least 2 to 3 days before starting another after each new food watch for any allergic reactions such as diarrhea rash or vomiting if any of these occur stop using the new food and talk with your pediatrician
2082000 but its important to note that the aap isnt just tossing out its old policies although the new report does advise changes in some of the guidelines the aaps allergy and nutrition expert panels stress that although current evidence doesnt provide adequate scientific support of some of the existing recommendations they arent ready to say those policies have been disproved altogether until they have more reliable research in hand

2082272 in 2005 the wisconsin state legislature passed a bill that requires all public schools that teach human growth and development to stress abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred choice of behavior in relationship to all sexual activity and that abstinence from sexual activity before marriage is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases

2082276 were in danger of seeing the 2008 election stolen again as in 2000 and 2004
2082277 in florida in 2000 and ohio in 2004 we witnessed the obstruction and manipulation of votes by election officials and possible tampering with computer voting machines but equally insidious is the malapportionment of electoral college votes which disenfranchises whole sections of the voting public
2082278 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
2082279 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution
2082280 weve witnessed in election after election how some states have used the winner take all formula to prevent the votes of political ethnic and other minorities from being counted
2082281 alter the fate of the 2008 presidential election in a manner different from any presidential election in the nations history
2082282 by refusing to challenge electoral college malapportionment in 2000 and 2004 which blocked democratic electors from voting in those elections the democratic partys leaders abandoned tens of thousands of their own voters just as they failed to challenge the election irregularities in florida and ohio in 2000 and 2004
2082283 will they fail to challenge malapportionment again in 2008 and hand the republicans another victory barack obama would not be the democratic nominee if not for the democratic partys proportional assignment of primary delegates the winner take all provisions in the general election present the distinct possibility that mr obama in 2008 will win the popular vote by a considerably larger margin than did gore in 2000 but will repeat the democratic loss in the electoral college
2082284 if proportional assignment is considered by democrats to be vital to democracy in their primary elections why wont they fight for it in the general election
2082285 the democratize the electoral college program exposes the hypocrisy and fraud behind charges that the mckinney campaign might spoil the democratic presidential tickets chances of winning democratic leaders should have to explain why they choose to ignore 13 additional electors from southern states that theyd gain through the green partys presidential electors project why is the green party fighting to give voice to democratic voters that the democratic party will not fight for let me be clear were not doing this to assist barack obama but to foster real democracy and voter participation and to offer cynthia mckinney as the truly democratic choice for all the people
2082286 americans dont vote for president instead we vote for an electoral college which was created in the late 1700s to expressly increase the power of the slave states and which it is still doing
2082287 the electors in these southern states arkansas 6 electoral votes georgia 15 electoral votes louisiana 9 electoral votes tennessee 11 electoral votes texas 34 electoral votes are not bound by state law to cast their vote for a specific candidate
2082288 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution

2082317 the mccain campaign is determined to give their paris hilton ad a run for its money in the desperation department and theyve succeeded only in shining a light on the fact that the while most of the video clips in the ad are taken from before the presidential election season obamas comments were made less than two weeks before his official campaign kickoff and clintons were from march of this year kerry rips former pal mccain for ad citing praise from dems update howard dean and joe biden have responded to the mccain ad since this story was first posted john mccain of 2008 is not the maverick of 2000 on the most urgent national security challenges we face iraq iran and al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan there is no daylight between president george bush and john mccain

2082350 mr market apparently was hoping sprint finally would be put out of investors misery by south koreas sk telecom with which sprint has been in talks about everything from an outright sale to a 5 billion stake sale
2082351 it is too early to tell what will happen with sprint and sk telecom that said the company didnt pull the convertible offering because a merger is in the works instead people familiar with the offering say the deal suffered from garden variety investor ennui
2082352 combined with the fact sprint is continuing the struggle and the current environment its not great timing
2082353 the answer is yes and were working on that right now

2082370 this constitutes a binding legal agreement between the parties to negotiate and execute a definitive agreement including the terms and conditions of this letter of intent and other provisions customarily and ordinarily included in the type of transaction contemplated herein
2082371 instead the parties both experienced in business negotiated a contract the letter of intent which did not provide for the award of fees in the event of its breach even though they later agreed that any definitive agreement would include such a clause therefore no such fees may be awarded on an action for breach of the letter of intent even though fees could be awarded on an action for breach of the definitive agreement there is no inherent inequity in enforcing the agreements as written
2082372 no legal authority allows a trial or appellate court to add a term to a contract no matter how usual and customary it is in the absence of evidence that the parties so intended the only reference to usual and customary contract provisions in the letter of intent states that such terms will be included in the lease that reference does not open the door to the addition of terms to the letter of intent
2082373 mere allegation of a contractual right to attorney fees is not sufficient to create an estoppel
2082374 the simple boilerplate fee requests in the answer and cross complaint are too slight to uphold a finding of judicial estoppel especially since the answer also included the affirmative defense that there was no basis for an award of fees since there was no contract between the parties
2082375 customers clearly told us the gap between sql server 2000 and sql server 2005 was too long
2082376 we heard this and committed from there forward to a 24 to 36 month release cycle and said that that the next release of sql server would be available 24 to 36 months from the release of 2005
2082377 our overall objective was to get a lot of customer feedback and get a lot of apps into production
2082378 this has clearly become a rock star product for microsoft
2082379 its gone from being interesting to strategic and a billion dollar plus product and its used so widely by other products at microsoft
2082380 youll have multiple cpus being deployed on top of which you run multiple virtual machines and the net effect is you push a lot more i o traffic into the network
2082381 if you have 1 000 physical machines each deploying 10 virtual machines as far as the networks concerned you need 10 000 ports
2082382 unlike technologies and platforms in the past that were focused on just monitoring the network or those that have focused just on monitoring the security products protecting that network we converge both views both sets of surveillance data so that you get not only a better overall picture of whats going on but a more accurate summary of what you should react to
2082383 they deliver our technology in branded appliances to their worldwide customer base
2082384 our oems and our channel partners are satisfying a similar goal they give us a force multiplier in the market and they are already dealing with a broad set of different customers in terms of size and sophistication
2082385 were delighted when our var channel partners are able to add their own services
2082386 weve recently added head count in the field to directly support our channel partners particularly vars and were continuing to do that
2082387 we look for the partners that are doing that with different verticals today and above and beyond that partners that are able to deliver training that like to deliver professional services and that like to actively market what theyre doing both from a product and a solution standpoint to customers
2082388 historically the early players in the space were extremely complex and required an awful lot of dedicated vendor professional services to get up and running
2082389 we have spent a lot of time on our product our packaging and our architecture so increasingly theres a lot of out of the box capability which means its a lot more channel friendly in the ability for a partner to be able to not just tell a customer how were going to solve their problem but then to be able to deliver that in a pretty short timeframe
2082390 everything in our price list has margin for our partners
2082391 we do partner certification we have multiple tiers of partners according to how much work theyre doing with us and what investment theyve made we have mdf programs we do deal registration we have all the components in place that make us a good company for our channel partners to do business with
2082392 fortune 500 firms are doing way better than i thought with 70 percent tested and patched
2082393 almost everything on the internet depends on dns returning the right number for the right request
2082394 if everything depends on receiving the right number for the right names wouldnt a bad guy want his number returned instead
2082395 with the attacker as the man in the middle on dns you dont just read mail you can corrupt it
2082396 company a sends company b a document and you can infect it
2082397 there is always another way to get screwed by bad dns

2082399 i think its like paypal and no one else im exaggerating but not by much
2082400 dns bugs create a skeleton key across all web sites

2082407 its very exciting to have such a caliber of executive though he has a hell of a job ahead of him
2082408 we also have to determine which market we will focus on and will our focus be on feature format or form factor our distribution channel has to be improved as well
2082409 motorola believes having two co ceos is the right structure to provide the necessary management focus and agility to position both businesses for long term success as two separate companies
2082410 the idea of microsoft free personal computing has been in the air for a while
2082411 were just partnering with linux distribution vendors and hardware vendors to make it happen
2082412 our role is more on evangelizing and providing the necessary software for corporate needs
2082413 i think the need for alternatives to the microsoft dominated personal computing environment are there
2082414 were providing the toolkit to isvs who will work with mid market and small customers and allow them to package their applications with linux and the necessary middleware
2082415 were viewing this as an alternative to the microsoft small business server group of products
2082416 rather than talk about virtualization technology for an appliance were talking about something that is simple and has a small footprint
2082417 a lot of it shops lack the experience to quickly deploy a linux based cluster
2082418 by making this software stack available were trying to make cluster deployment faster
2082419 one of the new features is that it allows you to build custom servers
2082420 so users will only have the components that are necessary for running their particular application and this adds tremendously to the agility and flexibility of the system
2082421 there are also additional server monitoring tools included and overall deployment and system management has been streamlined
2082422 despite red flags suggesting that the shares it sold were issued through unregistered offerings
2082423 on the average five times as many people read the headlines as read the body copy
2082424 it follows that unless your headline sells your product you have wasted 90 percent of your money
2082425 he hasnt a chance because if the headline is poor the copy will not be read and copy that is not read does not sell goods
2082426 on the other hand if the headline is a good one it is a relatively simple matter to write the copy
2082427 for obviously it is the headline that gets people into the copy the copy doesnt get them into the headline in other words the copywriters aim in life should be to try to make it harder for people to pass up his advertisement than to read it and right in his headline he takes the first and truly giant step on the road to that goal
2082428 advertising says to people heres what weve got heres what it will do for you heres how to get it
2082429 forget words like hard sell and soft sell that will only confuse you just be sure your advertising is saying something with substance something that will inform and serve the consumer and be sure youre saying it like its never been said before
2082430 a copywriter should have an understanding of people an insight into them a sympathy toward them
2082431 i dont know the rules of grammar if youre trying to persuade people to do something or buy something it seems to me you should use their language the language they use every day the language in which they think we try to write in the vernacular
2082432 the secret of all effective advertising is not the creation of new and tricky words and pictures but one of putting familiar words and pictures into new relationships
2082433 shakespeare wrote his sonnets within a strict discipline fourteen lines of iambic pentameter rhyming in three quatrains and a couplet were his sonnets dull mozart wrote his sonatas within an equally rigid discipline exposition development and recapitulation were they dull
2082434 a writer should be joyous an optimist anything that implies rejection of life is wrong for a writer

2082436 as we refine our business strategy we continue to evaluate opportunities to strengthen our business and implement cost reduction initiatives which may include de levering and disposing of assets
2082437 for example we are exploring alternatives for our iden network and related operations that include improving operations making additional investments entering into strategic partnerships and considering potential divestitures
2082438 so we are very committed to our customers on iden and making that a great experience
2082439 but what i have also said is that since ive taken this job that every option is on the table and every option will continue to be considered
2082440 useful life of the iden network assets which had a net carrying value of 7 8 billion as of june 30 2008
2082441 we believe that new subscribers are attracted to our differentiated products and services particularly cdma based data related services and other non voice services
2082442 these products and services include data cards downloading music global positioning satellite or gps enabled navigation services instant messaging and emails sending and receiving pictures playing on line games browsing the internet wirelessly and with our powersource and qchat devices using walkie talkie applications
2082443 executing our turnaround strategy especially as it relates to m amp a activities
2082444 and 1 000 000 upon the boards approval of the strategic resolution of the iden network
2082445 we know that groups and organizations are having a hard time raising money right now
2082446 this software will allow fundraisers to raise money for their groups while giving their supporters an opportunity to save hundreds of dollars merchants benefit from the free advertising and increased business from the coupons its a win win win solution for everyone
2082447 if the ban on caning is lifted it is not only the government that would be viewed as retrogressive even the parents will feel guilty

2082462 n ew mechanisms are needed for regional and global governance that include actors other than states
2082463 moreover states must be prepared to cede some sovereignty to world bodies if the international system is to function
2082464 globalisation thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality but that it needs to become weaker states would be wise to weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves because they cannot insulate themselves from what goes on elsewhere sovereignty is no longer a sanctuary

2082467 new jerseyans pay twice for the farm bill once in higher federal taxes to fund big handouts to wealthy farmers in other states and again in the higher prices they pay at their supermarket checkout line
2082468 politicians like senator lautenberg have been in office so long and are so disconnected with average taxpayers that they fail to see the wastefulness of this bloated depression era legislation to them it is business as usual catering to special interests throwing good money after bad all at taxpayer expense
2082469 its appalling that in a time of high gas prices washington lobbyist dick zimmer would criticize an energy bill that makes our vehicles more fuel efficient and invests in alternatives to foreign oil and in a time of high food prices he would criticize legislation to increase food stamps food banks and school nutrition programs for the neediest new jerseyans
2082470 republican u s senate candidate dick zimmer has criticized incumbent democrat frank lautenberg for not bringing back enough money during his 24 years in washington
2082471 defining as a war crime the material support for terrorism does not appear to be supported by historical precedent

2082502 i think this concept of flow feels like a good way to promote antisocialism in development teams deemphasizing communication between developers to promote a team of cowboys working on code that requires a lot of headspace to work on it feels to me like it would be a lot better to keep communication frequent keep the bus factor high that kind of thing and if it makes simple code a necessity in order to get stuff done all the better

2082532 he cannot and will not support legislation that raises taxes
2082533 more likely to enrich oil companies than to lower gas prices for american consumers
2082534 i think the problem with mccains position is that he keeps saying im in support for all of the above but when it comes down to specifics in what he will really support the only thing that comes through loud and clear is more drilling and i think that is the big vulnerability on his part
2082535 the tax the oil company issue is really difficult for republicans but the polling data indicates that the public thinks the oil companies have big role to play i dont know what is really going on here or if mccain is thinking this through carefully but i think this is undermining his credibility and to some degree is his hallmark approach looking for bipartisan solutions to problems
2082536 in the end he might have to do exactly what obama has done join the compromise while saying he objects sternly to the taxes but even then he risks getting killed by his conservative base

2082548 we are setting ourselves up for a much worse year than this year
2082549 we are just dotting the is and crossing the ts we should be forming a government in which we will be sharing power within the next few days
2082550 we have agreed to adopt a system which is almost similar to the french model in which both the president and the prime minister wield a lot of power
2082551 generally we have been agreed on many issues and that is why we have almost completed the talks in a short time everybody involved in the talks acknowledges that the people have suffered for too long as a result of the political and economic hardships caused by the political stalemate
2082552 the talks have gained so much momentum that it would almost be impossible to abort them
2082553 all parties have increased the number of negotiators and technical committees while support staff have been flown in to south africa to prepare for the signing ceremony expected by saturday as zanu pf we have started inviting guests who should attend the ceremony where the power sharing deal will be signed
2082554 the mdc responded by saying home affairs which controls the police and justice were non negotiable as they wanted to safeguard themselves from possible unfair treatment before the justice delivery system
2082555 that is why very few people are surprised by reports that the homicide section of the countrys largest police station in harare was bombed over the weekend
2082556 the mdc felt zanu pf needed to clean up the mess that it had created by running down the economy local government was preferable as the mdc now controls most of the local authorities and it would give them influence to consolidate its presence countrywide
2082557 we humbly suggest that the outcome of the ongoing talks should lead to the setting up of a transitional authority headed by nonpartisan technocrats mandated to come up with a people driven constitution as well as create an environment conducive to the holding of truly free and fair elections within a period of not more than two years
2082558 we reiterate our calls for the establishment of a transitional authority with a specific mandate of taking zimbabwe to a lasting democracy as opposed to a power sharing government of national unity gnu
2082559 a gnu is a stopgap measure which gives the ruling zanu pf party breathing space before reverting back to its war path on the opposition supporters and the broader pro democracy movement
2082560 its time to buy airlines retailers financials and consumer discretionary

2082562 this is one of the weaker months ive seen in the last five years
2082563 were continuing to see a divergence here in where the retail dollars are flowing
2082564 they really seem to be flowing into the nondiscretionary areas like drugstores food and gasoline and its really coming at the expense of some of these retailers such as apparel and electronics and appliances
2082565 young people have not taken to sea cruises because they have the idea that these are for older people and also because they are too expensive we are a sea minded nation and by designing these cruises for under 35s with top class entertainment and at a price young people can afford i believe we will attract a vast new market which the shipping industry so badly needs
2082566 the message was so youre single you can still have sex you can have a great life and if you marry dont just sponge off a man or be the gold medal winning mother dont use men to get what you want in life get it for yourself sex and the citys
2082567 i think marriage is an insurance for the worst years of your life during your best years you dont need a husband you do need a man of course every step of the way and they often are cheaper emotionally and a lot more fun by the dozen
2082568 as one of the 25 most influential women in america
2082569 i think the single womans biggest problem is coping with the people trying to marry her off she is driven by herself and her well meaning but addlepated friends to become married that her whole existence seems to be an apology for not being married

2082578 this decision does not affect the hydrogen bus project of which 10 vehicles will begin operating by 2010 as planned

2082817 nosotros creemos que la transparencia y el debate abierto son pilares de los gobiernos democr ticos y que emitir leyes a trav s del poder presidencial va en contra de esos principios
2082818 ni los ciudadanos venezolanos tuvieron la oportunidad de participar en un debate
2082819 presentan un contenido restrictivo a los derechos fundamentales consagran principios y fines de un solo pensamiento ideol gico modifican normas constitucionales sin el debido procedimiento democr tico de consulta
2082820 es una deliberada y grave violaci n constitucional y una burla a la voluntad popular
2082821 prefieren mantener la ventaja de uno de los contendores gobierno en contra de los principios m s elementales del derecho contitucional

2082828 lo que hemos podido apreciar es muy negativo por eso pedimos tener una reuni n con la contraparte por eso necesitamos tener una visi n total porque lo que podamos volcar en la comisi n de derechos humanos con esa salvedad que es parcial no va a ser positivo y para todos es preocupante

2082833 el presidente de venezuela ha actuado por decreto durante muchos meses

2082854 i think the country could be spared a lot of agony and the government could worry about inflation and a lot of other problems if nixon would go on and resign there is no question that an admission of making false statements to government officials and interfering with the fbi and the cia is an impeachable offense
2082855 the other thing we have to do is to take seriously the role in this problem of older men who prey on underage women there are consequences to decisions and one way or the other people always wind up being held accountable
2082856 i ask that all americans demonstrate in their personal and public lives the high ethical standards that are essential to good character and to the continued success of our nation bill clinton in 1997 during national character counts week
2082857 the road to tyranny we must never forget begins with the destruction of the truth
2082858 theres just no such thing as truth when it comes to him he just says whatever sounds good and worries about it after the election
2082859 no wonder americans hate politics when year in and year out they hear politicians make promises that wont come true because they dont even mean them campaign fantasies that win elections but dont get nations moving again
2082860 it is wrong to raise money on the promise of guaranteeing specific kinds of access that is wrong and we have stopped that
2082861 the purpose of government is to rein in the rights of the people

2082898 our investigation discovered harassment that engaged in the worst stereotypes and slurs about blacks latinos and jews and that upper management actively participated in this behavior
2082899 this is a major victory for mr gonzales and mr lewis the employees who testified on their behalf and future employees at video only the settlement should send a strong message that harassment based on race national origin and religion has no place in the workplace and that those who speak out against discrimination are protected by law from retaliation
2082900 the kind of heavy handed intimi dation video only employed led us to seek a pre trial ruling the courts june 11 finding affirms eeocs position that retaliation designed to frighten employees from reporting or testifying about discrimination violates the law these employees should be recognized for their courage in stepping forward

2082906 the discipline which makes the colleagues of a strong organization effective in operations is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatment on the contrary such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make a strong organization it is possible to impart guidance and to give directions in such a manner and such a tone of voice to inspire in a colleague the feeling of an intense desire to obey while the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail to excite strong resentments and a desire to disobey the one mode or other of dealing with colleagues springs from the corresponding spirit in the breast of the leader he who feels the respect which is due to others cannot fail to inspire in them regard for himself while he who feels and hence manifests disrespect towards others especially his subordinates cannot fail to inspire hatred against himself

2083401 i cant look you in the eye and say im sure were going to avert this

2083408 consider the pettiness of mens minds they ask for that which injureth them and cast away the thing that profiteth them they are indeed of those that are far astray we find some men desiring liberty and priding themselves therein such men are in the depths of ignorance liberty must in the end lead to sedition whose flames none can quench thus warneth you he who is the reckoner the all knowing know ye that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal that which beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints as will protect him from his own ignorance and guard him against the harm of the mischief maker liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety and to infringe on the dignity of his station it debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity and wickedness regard men as a flock of sheep that need a shepherd for their protection this verily is the truth the certain truth we approve of liberty in certain circumstances and refuse to sanction it in others we verily are the all knowing say true liberty consisteth in mans submission unto my commandments little as ye know it were men to observe that which we have sent down unto them from the heaven of revelation they would of a certainty attain unto perfect liberty happy is the man that hath apprehended the purpose of god in whatever he hath revealed from the heaven of his will that pervadeth all created things say the liberty that profiteth you is to be found nowhere except in complete servitude unto god the eternal truth whoso hath tasted of its sweetness will refuse to barter it for all the dominion of earth and heaven
2083409 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive
2083410 they also know that scabs face social rejection if they betray their mates

2083434 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
2083435 we have heard a great deal this year about the need for change
2083436 but at the same time we are told that one thing cannot change namely the abortion regime of roe vs wade
2083437 it is time that we demand real change and real change means the end of roe vs wade
2083438 abortion is different abortion is the killing of the innocent on a massive scale
2083439 it is time to put away the arguments of political spin masters that only serve to justify abortion killing
2083440 end the political manipulation of catholic voters by abortion advocates
2083441 it is time to stop creating excuses for pro abortion candidates catholics should no longer be asked to be partners in the abortion regime by voting for politicians who support abortion
2083442 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who defend and support a culture of death
2083443 it is time that catholics shine a bright line of separation between themselves and all those politicians of every political party who defend the abortion regime of roe vs wade

2083452 if we are to see real competition in wireless or broadband its time for google to take out sprint
2083453 while tests and deployment of wimax are moving ahead no one trusts the sprint brand and with good reason im a dissatisfied customer it actually lost 901 000 customers last quarter
2083454 the answer is simple buy the preferred becoming sprints largest shareholder then with institutional support change the brand name to google wireless or google clearwire customers will immediately give the company a second chance google gets a large retail network for pushing android phones and wimax cards as well as google swag and the google brand
2083455 im world champion and i realize that last time against serra i didnt really realize what i had i know what it is now and i dont want to lose it im going to fight to win not fight to not lose im going to go for the finish
2083456 not only does that come from my athleticism but from my mixed martial arts background and also from my trainers and training partners
2083457 thats what i believe but there is only one way to find out and well find out saturday night

2083459 i have the chance to succeed where i failed the last time
2083460 i struggled early in my wrestling career at purdue because i lacked confidence but ever since i started fighting ive put myself on the same playing field mentally as my opponents and my confidence is through the roof
2083461 im just as much of an athlete and just as much of a man as anyone im facing
2083462 every fight that i get into is like a championship fight
2083463 i consider this like my last fight obviously every fight is an important fight at this point youve got two fighters at the top of the weight division this fight means a lot so this is like a championship fight in my mind
2083464 im american so i am going to pick an american to win

2083466 its a great day in the life of truett mcconnell college and georgia baptists the tmc board of trustees is extremely excited about the future of our school under the leadership of dr emir caner we proudly welcome dr caner and his family and look forward to working with him in the fall semester
2083467 dr emir caner will bring to truett mcconnell a level of christian education that will raise the bar academically but also manifest itself in the life of the students
2083468 dr caner is a scholar a professor a writer a preacher and an experienced administrator a powerful combination of gifts at the same time he has a vibrant personality and is easy to know he has a contagious warmth is enjoyable to be with and is an excellent conversationalist
2083469 gods leading is evident in the calling of dr emir caner as the new president of truett mcconnell college i sincerely believe that dr caners presidency will be characterized by unprecedented expansion of our student body by strengthening our readiness to serve the lord through christian education and by rapid growth of our financial resources
2083470 i think a lot of people assume a lot of things about why square made that announcement
2083471 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us
2083472 so i think people make a lot of assumptions about what they read or the rumours that go around but the reality of a lot of this is that were doing very well we have a great install base we have passionate gamers like you guys that buy a lot of games and a publisher like square cant ignore that
2083473 i think its easy to assume that somethings going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360
2083474 i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us

2083481 ten years ago the government used a similar charge of sodomy against anwar ibrahim and kept him in jail for six years the conviction was ultimately overturned
2083482 in 1998 amnesty international considered anwar ibrahim a prisoner of conscience today there are again indications that the government is not playing by the rules in this case
2083483 we are also concerned about the safety of all the witnesses in this case particularly dr mohamed osman and we call on the government to provide adequate protection to them
2083484 its fair for the malaysian people and the international community to judge the malaysian governments respect for the rule of law based on how they proceed with this case

2083500 i made my decision that there was insufficient evidence to uphold a conviction of state farm on evidence we had at the time
2083501 hood has also been pursuing a criminal investigation of state farm which he said he would drop when the class action settlement is finalized
2083502 because it did not provide enough information for him to conclude that it was fair just balanced and reasonable
2083503 during the reevaluation and arbitration process state farm will not assert as a ground for the total denial of a claim that water contributed to policyholders loss if wind damage occurred

2083508 tax exempt groups cannot use their resources to support or oppose candidates for public office
2083509 when a church paid pastor stands in the tax exempt pulpit and urges the congregation to help certain candidates thats a clear violation he is the top church official and he is there in his official capacity
2083510 i find the manner in which davis issued this pulpit endorsement particularly offensive
2083511 he appears to be openly mocking the irs rules furthermore davis statement indicates that he is clearly aware that the irs does not permit tax exempt houses of worship to engage in partisan politicking he did so anyway fully aware that he was violating the law
2083512 worried and concerned about achieving their economic and financial goals over the next five years

2083576 in these very difficult times for the entire banking industry we think three things are most important liquidity capital and returning to profitability the asset transactions we announced two weeks ago brought in substantial liquidity removing these assets from our balance sheet in july will provide meaningful support to our capital ratios keeping us above the regulatory standards for a well capitalized bank while the losses we will book in 2008 from these asset sales and exit costs are large the restructuring will allow us to return to profitability in 2009
2083577 through asset sales and significantly reducing our exposure to home equity credit losses management and the board are re focusing the corporation on our core services to small business and local branch based customers
2083578 with the remaining home equity portfolio in run off mode we have capped our exposure to the national home equity industry while we exit this business
2083579 we believe we can return to profitability in 2009 by simplifying our business returning to the principles that have driven our success for the past 137 years serving small businesses and consumers in our branch communities and our franchisee customers nationally
2083580 with the transactions we announced on july 25 we have begun restructuring the organization
2083581 accounting rules required that we take charges in the second quarter for assets we sold in july without simultaneously removing the assets from the balance sheet on a pro forma basis however capital ratios will increase as assets sold in july and august are removed from the balance sheet in the third quarter compared to the applicable regulatory standard of 10 0 for a well capitalized bank total capital to risk weighted assets which ended the second quarter at 10 7 percent would have increased to 12 1 percent on that same date if the loans being sold in these transactions were also removed from the balance sheet and the estimated additional exit costs were included

2083737 drink drivers can no longer be stereotyped as eight pint men and it is feared part of the problem rests with a high drink drive limit and confusion over what is safe to drink
2083738 while women are less likely to run the risk of breaking the drink drive limit there are a rising number of female drivers being convicted of drink driving
2083739 people think it wont happen to them that they wont get caught they wont be involved in a crash we must challenge these presumptions in order to change drivers attitudes and behaviour
2083740 the thought of getting caught and the consequences need to seem a very real prospect for drivers who through selfishness or ignorance continue to put lives at risk by getting behind the wheel after drinking for drivers who do want to abide by the law we must make it easy for them to do so by sending out a very clear message that even one drink is one too many

2083771 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
2083772 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
2083773 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
2083774 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china

2084176 the universe and story for the game have been discussed here at gearbox for quite some time
2084177 weve always had a desire to make a game based in a gritty and rough sci fi universe so when we decided to start making borderlands the project leads came together and started to expand upon this theme over the course of our pre production phase we continued to mold the story into what it is today a lot of people have influenced the story it has truly been a team effort and this has helped create a real sense of ownership and commitment from everyone
2084178 there is a main mission storyline that advances the story and the game and there are large open environments in borderlands that are ripe for exploration
2084179 you will come across all sorts of enemies loot and gameplay experiences along the way we also have several vehicles to help you get around in addition to doing crazy vehicle combat with so you wont be slogging along on foot all the time because of both the dynamic nature of the game the size of the world the randomization of certain aspects of gameplay and game adjusting itself based on the number and experience level of the players its a different gameplay experience every time you go through it if you just want to go exploring there is always new stuff to find and new enemies to fight
2084180 we designed borderlands as a 4 player co op game from the ground up
2084181 anyone who has the game can begin a game instance and invite others to join that game instance that they are hosting at any time any player joining can either start a new character or bring their character from a different game instance with them to their friends game along with any experience gear loot etc that they already have they can trade or sell their current gear find or buy more level up etc and then take their persistent character back to their own game
2084182 our qa guys have their work cut out for them we have several game designers who are focused exclusively on making sure all the weapons gear skills leveling are both functional and a lot of fun and qa is constantly hammering on the game to make sure everything works right due to the nature of our system there will be some weapons that are more powerful than others those are the ones you are going to be looking for there are some loose rules in place that govern how the guns are put together how rare and powerful they are and when and where you will find them but there will be times where you might find crazy powered guns that do mega damage when that happens we say let it its all part of the fun
2084183 aside from the human enemies in the world there are a variety of critters and creatures you will face
2084184 the game will have a healthy dose of both on foot fps action and crazy vehicle action
2084185 so far we have shown the outrunner vehicle kind of a futuristic dune buggy but we have others in the game as well right now we are having a lot of fun with the salt racer a dragster type vehicle that races around the salt flats blowing up other vehicles running enemies over and getting run off the road by scythids one of the creatures in the game each vehicle holds at least 2 players each has a gun the driver can operate yes drivers get to shoot too along with a gun turret and each provides a different kind of gameplay
2084186 weve had a lot of challenges with both game design and technology but have overcome them all one after another the team is incredibly ambitious which i suppose shows in the game that were making we set out to create something truly unique in the fps genre i believe were delivering on our goal the game has been a blast to work on we cant wait to get borderlands out there so everyone can experience it and play it for themselves
2084187 anyone who has the game can begin a game instance and invite others to join that game instance that they are hosting at any time any player joining can either start a new character or bring their character from a different game instance with them to their friends game along with any experience gear loot etc that they already have they can trade or sell their current gear find or buy more level up etc and then take their persistent character back to their own game

2084209 me sorprende la asiduidad con la que el ex presidente del gobierno de espa a don felipe gonz lez trata los temas energ ticos en estos ltimos tiempos sobre todo lo referido a la energ a nuclear por supuesto es muy bueno que una persona de su nivel opine sobre el sistema energ tico y utilice su gran poder de convencimiento en lo que quiera pero me preocupa que lo haga tergiversando algunos datos que est n a disposici n de todos en las p ginas web de las instituciones del estado espa ol ministerio de industria turismo y comercio www mityc es red el ctrica espa ola www ree es y otros me refiero en concreto a que seg n se extrae de la prensa opina que la electricidad que consumimos los espa oles procede en gran medida de las nucleares francesas me apetece aclarar que no es as el sistema el ctrico espa ol datos de 2007 es del orden de 287 twh teravatios hora de los que aproximadamente 55 el 19 proceden de las nucleares espa olas y 5 3 1 8 vienen de los intercambios el ctricos con francia por otro lado tambi n ser bueno saber que ese mismo a o 2007 espa a envi 7 4 twh a portugal y 3 5 a marruecos con lo cual el saldo final fue de 5 8 twh netos que exportamos a nuestros pa ses vecinos me parece que de esos datos no se pueden sacar las conclusiones que algunos pol ticos periodistas e incluso sindicalistas han extra do de que los espa oles somos muy hip critas porque nos oponemos a la nuclear y no nos importa consumir electricidad nuclear procedente de francia al margen de esto desde luego creo firmemente que seguimos sin tener una pol tica energ tica en espa a y en europa que se corresponda con las dificultades que tenemos en el horizonte inmediato y que ya se dejan ver

2084279 an agency i did some work with had a great system of 40 second meetings only those who needed to be present were present it was their job to gather the facts before the meeting each person had 40 seconds to get across their point and updates members of the meeting had truly learned how to cut to the chase and make their point the most important this skill followed through into their day to day work they now have a stronger ability to identify the true action points from the clutter timelines for jobs have since been dramatically decreased
2084280 in this method employees would place quirky signs on the back of their chairs displaying the status of their work mentality examples were kinda busy but up for random play im at one with myself do not disturb looking for inspiration etc it was a silent message to all team members of their current state of mind it gave other team members a better understanding of how to approach one another and ultimately how to get the most out of someone depending on their mood
2084281 i was discussing this once with an agency and they explained how clutter became frustrating because it also caused competitiveness amongst employees
2084282 sometimes people just need to escape and get away from their desk having the opportunity to provide break out rooms and productive distractions such as foosball tables games etc can often lead to increased productivity however with the productive distractions also comes a fine balance of work rest play

2084502 thats not how it works when oscar de la hoya fights hes on leno and letterman the night before his fight he weighs in in las vegas and then flies to los angeles to do pr for the fight because he makes more money because he becomes more popular and more people want to see him fight what happens is these guys turn into pussies is what happens

2084509 last week we saw reports of more wildfires in california sure as night follows day people will lay some of the blame on climate change but theres also the minor matter of people building homes in wildfire susceptible forests overgrown with vegetation due to decades of fire suppression thats like pitching a tent on the railroad tracks the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming your problem is that youre nuts

2084520 its not easy getting what you want while maintaining the environment and staying within budget but it is possible
2084521 as you move ahead in life you will find temptations and distractions that can take you off course you might also find that years may pass before you learn some important truths that who you are is more important than what you have and that you have responsibilities to your fellow citizens your country your family and yourself
2084522 a culture of responsibility means serving others through the toil of generations and the grace of god our nation has been given much and more and more americans are recognizing our obligation to help those who have little
2084523 you can strengthen our country by showing fiscal discipline in your lives
2084524 my advice to you is to not dig a financial hole you cannot get out of try your best to live within your means and bear in mind that there are no shortcuts to the american dream
2084525 so my call to those of you entering the business world is to be honest with your shareholders be truthful with your customers and give back to the communities in which you live and all of us have a responsibility to be good stewards of the environment
2084526 if you choose a career in public service maintain the highest ethical standards bring honor to whatever position you hold and always put the people you serve ahead of yourself
2084527 my wish is that you find a partner in life who loves you challenges you comforts you and gives your life meaning
2084528 in life there will be many temptations to distract you from your responsibilities popular culture can give you the impression that alcohol drugs or promiscuity can lead to fulfillment in life that is an illusion and i urge you to reject it
2084529 if you do fall short know that it is never too late to recover and get back on the right track there was a time in my life when alcohol competed for my affections but i found salvation in my family and in my faith there is no shame in recognizing your failings or getting help if you need it
2084530 the tragedy comes when we fail to take responsibility for our weaknesses and surrender to them
2084531 a leader unable to acknowledge that he got it wrong and unwilling to grow in office by learning from his mistake too stubborn to change and grow
2084532 we had some pretty wild parties back in the day

2084626 we spent 150 million of our own money and 100 money in nih to develop a vaccine we miss a deadline and they jerk the contract and destroy the company and there arent many vaccine companies they took a high tech company capable of making vaccines and killed it
2084627 this is a symptom of a government that doesnt know what its doing when it comes to interacting with the private sector
2084628 the pentagon knows how to do things like this health and human services had never contracted out anything this big and they didnt know what they were doing

2084635 its just a wag but id say that a certain senior administration official wants this case closed by january 20 2009 and there are folks at the fbi who are trying to do just that
2084636 as to who drove the decision we just done know
2084637 i think he was infatuated or thinking about getting involved
2084638 its not going well with the counselor im going to
2084639 but the investigators found some personal quirks according to law enforcement officials and people who knew the scientist well they found that dr ivins who had a history of alcohol abuse had for years maintained a post office box under an assumed name that he used to receive pornographic pictures of blindfolded women years ago he had visited kappa kappa gamma sorority houses at universities in maryland virginia and west virginia an obsession growing out of a romance with a sorority sister in his own college days at the university of cincinnati although someone who knew him well said the last such visit was in 1981
2084640 the investigation has shown that over the past twenty four years dr ivins was known to have utilized at least two post office boxes to communicate with members of the public to pursue obsessions and possibly engage in the unauthorized use of another persons name
2084641 wildswan you are quite right about what you said about kkg
2084642 someone had to sit and stare at them looking for anything that popped out then a detail was noticed not unlike the abberrations you mentioned then go out get a collection of envelopes and compare for the defect

2084644 in my opinion there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff and im one of them
2084645 and even with a good lab and staff to help run it it might take me a year to come up with a product as good

2084650 you need to get a drug into the bloodstream as an alternative to injecting it
2084651 you need the drug to get much deeper into the lung where the membranes are thinner and to do that you need smaller particles
2084652 theres only been an interest in generating tiny particles for that purpose for about the last 10 years
2084653 i know of no other technique that might give you that finished product
2084654 if you packaged this stuff in a container it would float out and its highly dispersible and messy to deal with
2084655 this concept of using something that would serve as a dessicant and a carrier at the same time is new

2084660 youd have to do a lot of trial and error to get the particles you wanted
2084661 you would need a chemist who is familiar with colloidal fumed silica and a material science person to put it all together and then some mechanical engineers to make this work probably some containment people if you dont want to kill anybody you need half a dozen i think really smart people

2084697 we need to recover a common understanding of what it means to be a global communion and a common understanding of the place and role of the episcopal office within the sensus fidelium of the whole church
2084698 to engage theologically and practically with situations of controversy as they arise or divisive actions that may be taken around the communion
2084699 entails an acknowledgement that in the most extreme circumstances where a church chooses not to adopt the request of the instruments of communion that decision may be understood by the church itself or by the resolution of the instruments of communion as a relinquishment by that church of the force and meaning of the covenants purpose until they re establish their covenant relationship with other member churches
2084700 lambeth indaba capturing conversations and reflections from the lambeth conference 2008
2084701 upholds faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage
2084702 listen to the experience of homosexual persons and to assure them that they are loved by god and that all baptized believing and faithful persons regardless of sexual orientation are full members of the body of christ
2084703 calls on all our people to minister pastorally and sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation and to condemn irrational fear of homosexuals violence within marriage and any trivialization and commercialization of sex
2084704 cannot advise the legitimizing or blessing of same sex unions nor ordaining those involved in same gender unions
2084705 person after person has said to me there is no desire to separate when we have discussed as weve had to the possibilities of remaining divided or becoming more so no one has relished this thought or thought it a good outcome in terms of our mission so assuming we dont indeed want to separate whats the unity we value so much is it only a sense of human loyalty or a warmth towards the people weve shared an experience with if so there is nothing distinctively christian in it it may be admirable and good but other sorts of community might do it as well and if we just tolerate each other that can in fact be an attitude well short of real respect or love beyond peaceful diversity lies christian unity and this is what should matter to us
2084706 first and above all this is union with jesus christ accepting his gift of grace and forgiveness learning from him how to speak to his father standing where he stands by the power of the spirit we are one with one another because we are called into union with the one christ
2084707 this is the catholic faith a global vision for a global wound a global claim on our service none of it is intelligible without belief in the one divine saviour raised from the dead pouring out the gifts of his spirit
2084708 make every effort to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
2084709 when a man gets up to speak people listen then look when a woman gets up people look then if they like what they see they listen
2084710 be nice to people on your way up because you will meet them again on your way down

2084713 a new jersey mailbox used to send the anthrax was less than 100 yards away from a sorority for which ivins harbored an intense life long obsession
2084714 the mailbox was near a storage closet used by a sorority that ivins used to frequent 27 years ago and by a specific chapter that ivins appeared to have absolutely nothing to do with
2084715 a history of alcohol abuse had for years maintained a post office box under an assumed name that he used to receive pornographic pictures of blindfolded women
2084716 let me reiterate no matter how good the microbial forensics may be they can only at best link the anthrax to a particular strain and lab they cannot link it to any individual

2084816 i thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for his strong moral leadership on this issue i want to commend the ranking member and the chairman of the foreign affairs committee for having the moral courage to bring this resolution to the house before congress adjourns
2084817 it is important that we speak truth to power and with the 2008 olympics in beijing about to begin it is important that the people of the united states be heard on our ideals as athletes from around the world and global media descend on china
2084818 it is important that we say as the late tom lantos chairman of the foreign affairs committee said in a hearing last year a few months before his death china is a police state
2084819 i personally believe that the selection of china as the site of the 2008 olympic games was a historic error
2084820 while there is much talk in the media today about the cloud of smog hanging over beijing as these games approach let me say from my heart the real cloud over the beijing olympics is the horror of forced abortion
2084821 and make no mistake about it chinas policy requires that unpermitted babies be aborted
2084822 in the committee we heard the most horrific stories of these so called family planning technical service workers literally breaking into homes dragging women in the ninth month of pregnancy off to clinics forcing abortions on them and in one case after another going to horrific means to ensure that the newly born childs life had been completely snuffed out
2084823 there is not time in this debate to recount those instances but they are legion in china and they result in the heartbreak of tens of millions of that country of good and decent people
2084824 so i commend the chairman of this committee mr berman for his leadership i commend mr chabot for his leadership and especially the gentleman from new jersey a leading voice for the sanctity of life in the united states of america for ensuring that this legislation this resolution comes before the olympics that we speak truth to the power in the peoples republic of china that here in the united states of america the people of this country will say with one voice we believe in freedom and we believe in life and we reject the policy of forced abortion in china and urge them to do likewise at this time

2084839 hugo ch vezs latest measures to concentrate power belies the conciliatory tone he adopted in recent months as a cynical move intended to shore up his declining popularity at home and appease an increasing negative image abroad he is clearly determined to turn venezuela into a socialist country despite the manifest objection of a majority of venezuelans who rejected his proposed constitutional reform last december which would do just that because ch vez has closed off the ability of the opposition to effectively participate in the political process civil society and popular sentiment remain the best hope for preventing the complete destruction of democracy in venezuela

2084842 one thing weve talked a lot about is contracts in europe being tax free or the team pays the tax how does that work
2084843 the way it works is that the team pays the tax in that jurisdiction and then at the end of the year they issue a certificate to the player that he can then apply against us taxes depending on where hes playing overseas that would dictate how much tax is paid on his behalf and then depending on where his state of residence is in the us that dictates how much of an offset that overseas tax would make against his us taxes a player is still responsible for his domestic taxes both federal and state but he gets to offset those taxes against whats been paid for him overseas

2085036 those who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion
2085037 the judgment of ones state of grace obviously belongs only to the person involved since it is a question of examining ones conscience however in cases of outward conduct which is seriously clearly and steadfastly contrary to the moral norm the church in her pastoral concern for the good order of the community and out of respect for the sacrament cannot fail to feel directly involved the code of canon law refers to this situation of a manifest lack of proper moral disposition when it states that those who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to eucharistic communion
2085038 the vacillation of data from one month to the next indicates a housing market in transition
2085039 the rise in pending home sales was broad based with all four regions showing gains this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
2085040 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit
2085041 these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
2085042 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices
2085043 in addition rising commodity prices and higher construction costs have resulted in a very unusual market today with existing home prices being less than replacement building costs in some areas home prices are projected to increase 3 to 6 percent in 2009
2085044 builders need to further cut production to help trim inventory however new home sales are expected to bottom around the second quarter of next year with slight gains in the second half of 2009

2085054 weakening in the governments long held position that settlements were illegal and an obstacle to peace
2085055 our embassy in tel avivs contacts with the settler community have been with the goal of setting out the british governments view on this issue and to seek to convince them that settlements are a significant obstacle to peace but you are right that their presence at this event was not helpful and the embassy is reviewing its procedures to ensure that it does not happen in the future
2085056 repeated charges regarding the illegality of israeli settlements must therefore be regarded as politically motivated without foundation in international law politically the west bank and gaza strip is best regarded as territory over which there are competing claims which should be resolved in peace process negotiations israel has valid claims to title in this territory based not only on its historic and religious connection to the land and its recognized security needs but also on the fact that the territory was not under the sovereignty of any state and came under israeli control in a war of self defense imposed upon israel at the same time israel recognizes that the palestinians also entertain legitimate claims to the area indeed the very fact that the parties have agreed to conduct negotiations on settlements indicated that they envisage a compromise on this issue

2085116 justice clarence thomas wins the partisanship award justice anthony m kennedy wins the neutrality award
2085117 to test for judicial activism and judicial restraint we examined all the data to find which justices are most likely to strike down agency decisions

2085200 the proof is going to be in an independent scientific analysis of that data said russell chairman of the sabin vaccine institute in washington
2085201 theyve made a very strong circumstantial case an extremely strong circumstantial case
2085202 outside defense lawyers and former prosecutors said authorities would have faced a challenge convicting ivins based on official documents released wednesday
2085203 some of the most persistent questions involved the science used by the fbi to make its case bioweapons experts said they were unimpressed by the governments description of the dna link between the letters and spores in a flask in ivins lab
2085204 there is not enough scientific information to make an evaluation of the science the fbi used in this investigation said tara otoole who heads the center for biosecurity at the university of pittsburgh
2085205 the government used ivins own desperate words found in e mails sent in the months and days before the attacks to show a man racked by paranoia who described himself as scary
2085206 at the same time he was increasingly upset by the trouble besetting an anthrax vaccine he was trying to return to production
2085207 as described by authorities wednesday ivins may have perpetrated the attacks in an effort to create fear that would in turn spur greater federal spending and overall support for biodefense
2085208 the newly unsealed documents also quote from an e mail that ivins sent on sept 26 2001 nine days before the death in palm beach county fla of stevens the first anthrax related fatality in the case
2085209 its interesting that we may now be living in a time when our biggest threat to civil liberties and freedom doesnt come from the government but from enemies of the government ivins wrote
2085210 in the anthrax letters that he is alleged to have mailed to sen
2085211 that in the months before the mailings that led to the deaths of five people and made 17 ill ivins who had worked at the armys top biodefense laboratory for 28 years told a friend that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behavior
2085212 im waiting for it to be shown that the quantity and the quality of the powders in the anthrax letters could have been produced in those suites
2085213 a partial log of ivinss work hours shows that he worked late in the lab on the evening of sunday sept
2085214 ivins also had ample time to return to the same nassau street mailbox the following month over the columbus day weekend when a second group of letters was sent to senate offices and media organizations the sources said offering new information that they said underscored ivinss opportunity to commit the notorious crime
2085215 more than a year before the anthrax attacks that killed five people in 2001 bruce e ivins told a counselor that he was interested in a young woman who lived out of town and that he had mixed poison that he took with him when he went to watch her play in a soccer match
2085216 if she lost he was going to poison her said the counselor who treated ivins at a frederick clinic four or five times during the summer of 2000 she said ivins emphasized that he was a skillful scientist who knew how to do things without people finding out
2085217 the counselor who spoke on the condition of anonymity said in an a two hour interview yesterday that she was so alarmed by her clients emotionless description of a specific homicidal plan that she immediately alerted the head of her clinic and a psychiatrist who had treated ivins as well as the frederick police department
2085218 was studying microbiology at chapel hill in the mid 1970s when ivins who was doing post doctoral work there took an obsessive interest in her sorority kappa kappa gamma
2085219 according to haigwood now the director of the oregon national primate research center in portland ivinss intrusive questions made her uncomfortable but his curiosity did not end when they both left north carolina
2085220 in 1982 after ivins took a job at fort detrick in maryland and haigwood coincidentally had moved to gaithersburg haigwood walked out of her apartment one morning and discovered that someone had spray painted kkg in red letters on her boyfriends car and on a fence behind their house
2085221 haigwood said she also thinks that ivins wrote a letter in her name the next year to the frederick news post claiming to be a member of kappa kappa gamma the letter defended hazing ivinss behavior prompted haigwood to contact the fbi in 2002 after the american society for microbiology circulated a note saying that the person responsible for the anthrax attacks was probably a microbiologist and asking members to report any tips i think the people who work with bruce do not know him completely haigwood said last night
2085222 our findings raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
2085223 the united states has the highest teen pregnancy rate among developing nations and rates of sexually transmitted diseases in this country are high the risks are real and if people want to keep teens safe from the negative outcomes of sex abstinence only programs are not the way to go more comprehensive programs that include abstinence as one choice are much more likely to have the outcomes we want that teenagers eventually will be in a positive and fulfilling sexual relationship

2085234 pineapple express is not a precious coming of age story like superbad its a weed action movie and if it did well and they gave us like 50 million dollars as opposed to the 26m we got for this one we could benefit from that
2085235 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to
2085236 so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie

2085370 we want all of this to be simple and risk to be nominal the main area in which people have difficutly is assessing their wealth and risk factors far too often we see online casinos investors jumping into a portfolio that is far too aggressive the end result can be disasterous invoking many to file bankruptcy
2085371 i invest heavily in areas that look promising but also proportionately balance my risk by putting some money in standard investments such as stocks bonds and money market funds
2085372 the motivation to have money from a online casinos portfolio in the future is great
2085373 but dont forget that you cant live in the future forever many people fall into the trap of not meeting basic needs in the present which logically means that their future will become progressively more difficult
2085374 make online casinos investments work for you and retire wealthy
2085375 give yourself a nice cussion of cash and retirement income
2085376 personally i save about 10 each month for retirement 20 as liquid cash for everyday needs and another 40 for investing this may sound very demanding especially with regard to online casinos investments but in actuality it is really a reflection of what you want for your future not necessarily what you want now
2085377 my top tip is making baby steps before giant leaps
2085378 by starting slowly your risk factor is greatly diminished and financial commitment is much lower you can get out at any time with minimal losses or move forward into more risky online casinos areas with good fundamental knowledge
2085379 were looking at the long term here quick wins are for lotteries and penny poker games not the online casinos investment market i think given enough time those who invest in this area will see good returns for their online casinos money

2085460 a guilty pleasure is known as something someone considers pleasurable despite feeling guilt for enjoying it fashion and food can be examples of guilty pleasures
2085461 is that music is not my guilty pleasure david cook is my guilty pleasure
2085462 when i was younger one of my guilty pleasures was wearing my sisters clothes i had to be real careful though and make sure i put it back in the exact same place in the exact same way it was hung luckily i left for school after she went to work and got home before she did oh to have a sister who is the same size as me again

2085469 there wasnt a lot of knowledge about water polo anyway and when the new rules came in 2005 those demands changed enough so that the way you prepare an athlete is different
2085470 team sports are a combination of power and stamina and understanding the mixture is the challenge
2085471 so what that means is that theres a lot more counter attacking in water polo
2085472 so when the defenders get a shot they would instantly change to attack and sprint down to try to get a fast break its now a higher tempo game
2085473 that is probably the biggest outcome in the changes to the rules
2085474 as a result weve had to come up with other ways such as video analysis and weve designed computer programs that allow us to break down each of the players movements at different times
2085475 and then we can work out what the overall demands are and work out how long the work to recovery ratio is and things like that
2085476 this is research that was done previously with hockey players and we learned a lot about how to understand team sports and what the demands are

2085478 prosecutors had called for a sentence of at least 30 years in prison and implored jurors to consider a life term and they ridiculed hamdans statement before the military court at the u s detention facility here
2085479 hamdan had admitted working for bin laden in afghanistan from 1997 to 2001 for 200 a month but said he worked for wages not to wage war on the u s
2085480 pentagon officials have insisted they retain the right to keep hamdan in prison whatever his sentence in the war crimes trial
2085481 defense lawyers and human rights advocates say the united states will come under intense international pressure to release hamdan if it refuses to free him even after he serves his sentence
2085482 critics of the court say the trial did not adhere to american standards of justice and that hamdan a chauffeur was not an important player in al qaida a view echoed by the presiding judge in the case

2085511 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
2085512 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
2085513 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
2085514 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china
2085515 business books on china are published so frequently these days it seems there is a secret factory churning them out

2085518 iraq is a very wealthy country enormous oil reserves they can finance largely finance the reconstruction of their own country and i have no doubt that they will
2085519 it is unimaginable that the united states would have to contribute hundreds of billions of dollars and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars
2085520 the united states is very committed to helping iraq recover from the conflict but iraq will not require sustained aid
2085521 there is a lot of money to pay for this that doesnt have to be us taxpayer money and it starts with the assets of the iraqi people we are talking about a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
2085522 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank

2085529 the other fighters and trainers they know who i am and what im capable of doing and really having that kind of respect is the most important
2085530 people sell me short and dont know how good of a fighter i am which is fine because i dont care
2085531 i dont do this to impress other people even guys in my sport dont know who the hell i am honestly my girlfriend had a friend come up and visit her this week and he was saying how he ran into rampage at a gas station in irvine calif a week ago
2085532 he asked if he knew who jon fitch was and told rampge he was friends with me he had no idea who i was he said hed never heard of me that says a lot when you have ex champs who have never heard of me
2085533 technically it would be the biggest thing in my career of course
2085534 people spend their whole lives striving to get a title shot let alone win a title so yeah its a big deal but again im hesitant to say this but im really hard on myself and even that even being regarded as the best in the world isnt enough for me
2085535 i have to see myself as the best in the world i have to see myself as the best i can be im hesitant to say this because it will make a lot of people mad and i dont want to do that but winning the title is not as big of a deal as me achieving the goals ive set forth for myself
2085536 this sport is so competitive and there are so many good guys out there its almost impossible to win two in a row let alone eight
2085537 think of what this guy has done think of how many great fighters have fought in the ufc and havent been able to do what he has done its amazing when you think about it
2085538 he told me you know dana im not the greatest knockout artist im not the greatest athlete im not the best submission guy what i am is a grinder and i am going to grind and grind and grind and never quit
2085539 you talk about working your way up the ladder punch by punch thats exactly what this guy did
2085540 and even though hes already accomplished so much he isnt satisfied and you know what no matter what he does he never will be because he always thinks he can do more thats the kind of guy you love having fight for you

2085595 banks are concerned with the state of the economy thats clearly the number one factor behind the tightening of credit standards
2085596 they dont want to engage in too much lending because they are afraid of seeing default rates increase
2085597 doesnt bode well for the investment outlook given that this sub index has always proven to be a good leading indicator of capital expenditure
2085598 what has really been striking me since last summer is the big difference in what they say they are doing and what they seem to be actually doing
2085599 that credit standards are being tightened in the current circumstances
2085600 the banks want the ecb to cut rates the more they are gloomy in the survey the more it may have a bearing on the ecbs reaction
2085601 we have seen a level of loans to the private sector which is still quite dynamic
2085602 once you know the gene thats responsible you can potentially figure out the proteins that are defective and possibly treat these patients
2085603 until you know what the defect is you cant devise any treatment once youve at least identified a defective gene you can work on potential treatments
2085604 the implications for dogs is that we have the possibility to reduce the frequency of this mutation in the population and in this way immediately avoid new cases of crd caused by this mutation
2085605 for humans the study may help in the identification of the etiology of some cases of crd and the dog could also be an extremely valuable model for the development of new treatment schemes for crd including gene therapy
2085606 in the future if they could use this model for gene therapy to see whether or not they can replace the gene product with a good protein that actually works in the retina and they can restore vision in this dachshund that would be helpful if we were to find same gene defect in humans that would be good news we could potentially use gene therapy in humans to restore vision
2085607 the cone cells are basically responsible for your very sharp central vision thats what allows you to read and see things far away and also provide you with color vision
2085608 the rods basically provide you with your peripheral or side vision and with your nighttime vision at night your cones dont work too well your rods are what enable you to get around in the dark
2085609 it may not be the same mechanism in humans but they think that it is
2085610 this is going to lead researchers in a direction where they know what to look for
2085611 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity

2085616 we do know she was at bagram for a long time it was a long time according to my client she was there for years and she was held in american custody her treatment was horrendous
2085617 in that open situation we were forced to keep our voices low as we were aware that we were video and tape recorded the whole situation made it impossible for me to meet properly with my client
2085618 numerous documents describing the creation of explosives as well as excerpts from the anarchists arsenal descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city
2085619 we believe aafia has been in custody ever since she disappeared
2085620 and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence
2085621 there are many questions that the fbi and the pakistani government need to answer in light of this admission
2085622 aafia siddiqui is a woman who has been plagued by a number of problems in her life none of which have anything to do with involvement with al qaeda
2085623 whilst we welcome this disclosure from the fbi it has only come after mounting international pressure and five years of detention and abuse siddiquis case represents the problem of disappearances in pakistan in the most tragic way the acceptance by the fbi that siddiqui has been in custody in afghanistan raises important questions which must be answered by the pakistani and us governments siddiqui must be returned to pakistan in order to faces charges for any crime she may have committed or released along with her children
2085624 so those fools cry about the deaths of americans and they dont cry about the deaths of our sons
2085625 many of these girls have suffered rape and sexual harassment but violence also includes beating and psychological abuse
2085626 violence against women is often blamed on mothers who teach their sons that women should be beaten and made to submit
2085627 the most shocking result of the study is that violence takes place within the domestic sphere and in the majority of the cases remains unpunished

2085634 god forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion the people cannot be all and always well informed the part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they conceive if they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is lethargy the forerunner of death to the public liberty and what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms the remedy is to set them right as to the facts pardon and pacify them what signify a few lives lost in a century or two the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure

2085931 there was a building once you lose a building you lose character and history the bloomberg administration is about growth and preservation this is why we have to act fast to change the zoning so developers arent allowed to come in here and build whatever they chose i dont mind a building that is in context with the others meaning the same height with architectural guidelines but small streets shouldnt have large development

2086122 i want this baseball betting project to take off and go somewhere and your support in this baseball betting event is a great start
2086123 i want to get on board as soon as possible but my risk tolerance in the baseball betting industry is much lower than others ill join after first quarter profits are reported to stock markets and investors
2086124 egge holdsworth is right about these particular areas of concern but i believe baseball betting business can still move forward and can still burst through any barriers of entry in the respective market take www w3 org for example this website came out of no where to be considered one of the top 1000 websites on the web today we think that our baseball betting knowledge is superior to all others and with the research skills of gehle alvelo of www fujitsu com we are sure to turn a profit
2086125 because my experience has been that baseball betting companies such as these are one in a million sometimes the best of ideas are just not feasible simply because baseball betting consumers like those found on www truste org or www w3 org are not ready for a new paradigm
2086126 im happy to see that my collegue porco esteban believes in this project
2086127 this project will help all involved greatly and will move things forward dramatically
2086128 the most thorough manner to approach baseball betting is through a methodical analysis of trends upward and downward movement and of course changes in the consumer aread
2086129 roman and his team at n5r have masses of relevant experience and plenty of fresh ideas combined with a confident and smooth delivery we are pleased with the professional information that n5r have brought to the table

2086185 i started this style from our skinny jeans and opened the bottom slightly to make it more casual
2086186 jennifer is not a tall girl but she likes the bootcut look because its very casual bootcut jeans can make you look shorter because the thighs and knees are too loose so by using a skinnier base we are able to give the leg a better shape it makes you look taller and slimmer
2086187 it has enough stretch to hide the little imperfections so you can feel sexy without compromising comfort

2086192 youd have to be blind not to notice the surge in hotel development in this town
2086193 this the foshay is one of the most important historic buildings in the midwest and among the top 20 most important buildings in the country im really happy that by converting the foshay into a hotel weve made it more accessible to the public than ever before
2086194 when the office market is weak but the hotel market is strong converting a smaller floorplate historic building to a hotel can make economic sense however as this has been done to several former office buildings in downtown minneapolis which were historic buildings these new hotels have absorbed the bulk of any under supply in hotel rooms
2086195 he foshay was a rebel of his time he had one elevator that took his women directly up to his private suite
2086196 wilbur foshay wasnt afraid to think big take risks or live large
2086197 and he certainly wasnt concerned if he upset the status quo he also knew how to put this city on the map in a big way when he built the foshay tower it put minneapolis into the headlines around the world
2086198 i became intrigued by checkered flags history which had never been researched and told
2086199 the more i learned about checkered flag the more i realized its story is a compelling one that has meaning for people both inside and outside of the car business
2086200 i found that the principles that originated more than a hundred years ago remain at the foundation of checkered flag today

2086210 allied assets advisors fund a delaware registered trust other fund board members at the time included jamal said the imam at a fundamentalist controlled mosque in illinois

2086782 yeah lol holiday heart references who knew id ever hear of that movie again

2086800 one of the problems is that a lot of people dont realize that they are having a stroke
2086801 there still needs to be a lot of education in the community for people to recognize these symptoms and when you recognize them call 911
2086802 there is also delay time among people who get to the hospital quickly so there is room for the medical community to act
2086803 once you get there you need to be diagnosed theres a very narrow window in which you can get treatment
2086804 we found that women were less likely to get timely treatment
2086805 also treatment was faster in hospitals that were certified stroke centers which have a formal plan for diagnosis and treatment
2086806 they were treated more quickly when they arrived by ambulance
2086807 it is better to call the ems than to take yourself to the hospital
2086808 the whole thing is recognizing a stroke on both ends the person who is having it getting to the hospital in timely fashion and also when they arrive at the hospital
2086809 so that when they walk in they are not given a number by someone and put in a corner for several hours
2086810 if something happens and it is a very severe stroke and someone suddenly stops breathing what are you going to do stop the car and give cpr
2086811 the important thing is to get to any hospital right away

2086958 hemp i have a feeling thats probably not going to make it into the platform
2086959 the platform defines what it is to be a democrat
2086960 this is a document that will give a statement of what obama is about and what he intends to do we want it to be a document that will bring people together and reflect who we think we are
2086961 how many times have you asked yourself with the torture doing away with habeas corpus ruining our shores how many times have you thought does this reflect who we are
2086962 weve had a number of candidates run who werent pro choice or had different ideas on energy its just a blueprint a guide
2086963 a lot of people dont even start paying attention until after labor day then they say i dont know who obama is well this is a simple document they can use to find out
2086964 at the time there were three major presidential candidates and we were all three attached to the campaigns
2086965 from the beginning we said we were going bring down the traditional walls of the democratic convention and make this event more accessible and include as many people as possible
2086966 and what happens is that the nominee does his speech and you have to have credentials to be on the floor and its maybe 15 000 to 20 000 people limited to party insiders or people who have some sort of in well obama opened that up to 80 000 people just to give almost anyone who wants to come an opportunity to come and hear him

2086971 i think a lot of people assume a lot of things about why square made that announcement
2086972 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us
2086973 so i think people make a lot of assumptions about what they read or the rumours that go around but the reality of a lot of this is that were doing very well we have a great install base we have passionate gamers like you guys that buy a lot of games and a publisher like square cant ignore that

2087029 you cant say english was wrong to call for williams to resign but he should resign himself if you are talking about application of principles
2087030 parliament should be consistent with the standards it has set for all end of story
2087031 remembering of course williams was talking to a group and english was having a private conversation there is a difference
2087032 however i cannot remember who the person was next to me
2087033 but he was either right or he was wrong if he was right for williams he was right for himsel f as well if he was wrong for williams he was wrong for himself as well

2087043 this is not a blame game all we want is for hsbc to facilitate the delivery of our presents
2087044 we believe this would be easily achieved and could actually be cheaper than organising refunds the deliveries could be organised at cost price and would be a huge publicity coup for them it could save them money as well
2087045 hsbcs view is that this should never have happened and had the directors acted sooner to address their financial difficulties and appointed administrators when hsbc recommended it may not have happened

2087060 this is a broader and more important collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models
2087061 the cells will allow researchers access for the first time to cell types of interest to watch the disease progress in a dish to watch what goes right or wrong well see in the years ahead that this opens the door to a new way of treating degenerative disease
2087062 that is where all of the science will go on over the next many many years
2087063 even though the ips methodology gives us a facile way for making disease specific lines it does not eliminate the value or need for continuing to study human embryonic stem cells
2087064 those are really the gold standard for pluripotent stem cell types they have no genetic modifications and at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue beyond that are going to be extremely valuable tools human embryonic stem cells allow you to ask questions that we never can ask with ips cells
2087065 whether or not were going to be able to figure out how to do it without viruses so we can use the cells therapeutically is as of today an unanswered question
2087066 im confident were going to get there and that within the next year or two we will have several strategies for reprogramming cells without viruses and when that happens we may have cells in our hands that may be valuable for cell replacement therapy
2087067 in these complex genetic diseases were so ignorant at the moment we dont even know if patients who get type 1 diabetes all get it the same way there could be 50 different ways to get type 1 diabetes

2087145 georgias step is absolutely incomprehensible and shows that the georgian leadership has zero credit of trust
2087146 you can argue that the president of south ossetia who wants independence from georgia is deliberately provoking tbilisi and is trying to suck russia in

2087168 fgf 23 helps regulate serum phosphate levels and we know that among patients with kidney failure elevated phosphate is associated with more rapid progression to renal failure and earlier death
2087169 the results of this study suggest that we need to be concerned about phosphate control even for patients whose serum phosphate levels are normal and that may involve routine screening for fgf 23
2087170 incorporating fgf 23 levels into the management of kidney failure may have its greatest potential for treatment of the millions of patients with early stage kidney disease who do not yet require dialysis who usually have normal phosphate levels but quite high fgf 23
2087171 routinely monitoring fgf 23 may help determine which patients need to begin therapies that control phosphate levels which may reduce mortality in this very high risk group

2087210 the college went further in its bad faith by chilling and seeking to prevent scientific debate through the canadian chiropractic association its response to the statement of the canadian neurologists and chiefs of neurology departments of major teaching hospitals in canada was to individually threaten each and every one of the physicians whose name was associated with the statement with professional disciplinary action with challenges to their standing and accreditation with hospitals and with legal action on the basis that their warning the canadian public and governments about the dangers of neck manipulation was defamatory to chiropractic

2087213 the study challenges the argument that theres no way illegal immigrants will go home and that you cant deport them all that its not practical
2087214 cis implies that the illegal immigrant population could drop to half of what it is now within the next five years if only presidential candidates keep silent about the details of comprehensive immigration reform taxpayers continue to pour billions of dollars into enforcement and the u s economic recession persists
2087215 this indicates that you dont need to deport everybody that you can really make a dent in this problem by conveying to folks that the immigration law is back to business
2087216 homeward bound recent immigration enforcement and the decline in the illegal alien population
2087217 this tends to suggest that public pronouncements and statements have consequences

2087221 todays report proves that america does not need new immigration laws comprehensive immigration reform or amnesty which only encourages more illegal immigration

2087224 it is unclear what is happening to the other 20 percent of illegal immigrants who are primarily from east and south asia

2087235 all of these factors together had an impact on people being willing to be trafficked

2087411 was to find out as much as i could about thaksin so i could assess the charges and allegations particularly of human rights abuses against him in the process ive learned a lot about and become quite fascinated with thai politics so these days i regularly monitor not only city message boards but also newspapers and blogs related to whats going on in thailand
2087412 poor thai women from the countryside with a modest education can make well educated worldly western men do really crazy things
2087413 what if we had a dinner with cheney or bush would you object to that
2087414 that depends on their stance with certain issues in the catholic church youre offering this as a prize to raise money
2087415 what about their stance on war they are the architects of this war which is totally contrary to the wishes of the pope
2087416 but you can be a catholic and support the idea of a just war you cant be a catholic and support abortion in any way shape or form
2087417 so you can throw abortion out the window because you dont like bush and the war
2087418 no but you put up with the imperfections of politicians nobody is perfect
2087419 have you ever discussed her positions on abortion and homosexual marriage with her
2087420 do you allow her to come to holy communion after the church has taught that manifest public sinners who are unrepentant are to be denied holy communion
2087421 i think the archbishop of st louis would disagree and hes a canon lawyer
2087422 yeah well i happen to be a canon lawyer too yknow and i think the bishops who said that are in a very minority position
2087423 is that how we decide truth even our holy father has said that truth is not determined by majority opinion
2087424 you sound like somebody who at the time of jesus would have said why is he sitting and eating with these public sinners
2087425 hopefully to convert them do you plan on doing anything to try to convert nancy pelosi
2087426 im certainly not going to convert her but i certainly will have an opportunity to talk with her as i had an opportunity to talk with our own congressman here mike thompson
2087427 do you plan on discussing any of these issues with her
2087428 but how many of them are people that take a public stance seen by the entire free world supporting the infanticide of children there have been over 40 million children killed by abortion
2087429 i think you have my take on this and its been good talking to you
2087430 is that how we decide truth even our holy father has said that truth is not determined by majority opinion
2087431 you sound like somebody who at the time of jesus would have said why is he sitting and eating with these public sinners
2087432 hopefully to convert them do you plan on doing anything to try to convert nancy pelosi

2087442 eighteen months down the line hell get out the jail maybe sooner hes got a life to get on with but we are still all picking up the pieces
2087443 im glad it wasnt just some idiot that didnt care and just laughed at the sentence
2087444 we thought we were going to hear a lot more of her injuries so i didnt want to go and listen to that plus i didnt want to see the guy but it came up on the telly at night anyway
2087445 i was quite gutted after listening to the trial because a female paramedic had gone over to doreen and there was still some electro activity in her heart
2087446 we were thinking would there have been a chance if she kept working on her would she have still been here
2087447 he said even if her injuries had happened right next door to an intensive care unit there would have been no chance of her surviving
2087448 that eased that a bit because i wouldnt have liked to have thought there was a chance and they gave up on her it saves you thinking along those lines
2087449 its just a horrible coincidence that he duncan came all the way from aberdeen and fell asleep at that bit its just unbelievable
2087450 thats whats hard to get your head around all the miles that he drove and thats where it had to happen a couple who were only two cars behind duncan at the time of the accident said his driving wasnt untoward before then all of a sudden he just went violently out right across the carriageway for no reason at all
2087451 the court said mr duncan was having to get counselling but what about those people who saw that happening theyre suffering flashbacks and its interfered with their lives as well
2087452 i think sean is taking things a bit harder mark said he would explain the court case to sean but the two wee ones dont understand as they get older they will start asking questions and we will be able to explain it a bit better

2087456 we probably feel some sense of closure we just need to try and get on with things now we have just got to cope scott is still the worst he cant speak about her at all mark has just got to get on with it as well hes got three kids
2087457 hes trying to revolve his life around the kids all the time now anything they want to do he just gets up and does it
2087458 when the kids are just staring into space you think what are they thinking
2087459 to stop the carbon in the atmosphere from increasing we only need to grow the biomass in the soil by a hundredth of an inch per year good topsoil contains about ten percent biomass schlesinger 1977 so a hundredth of an inch of biomass growth means about a tenth of an inch of topsoil changes in farming practices such as no till farming avoiding the use of the plow cause biomass to grow at least as fast as this if we plant crops without plowing the soil more of the biomass goes into roots which stay in the soil and less returns to the atmosphere

2087639 the products and marketing campaigns that our econology advantage tm division is developing all have the vertical branding dna of a compelling value proposition at an attractive price point they also provide more environmentally sensitive alternatives to existing products and ways of meeting everyday consumer needs our goal for this new initiative is to create a win win scenario for our customers who can save money in these uncertain economic times while simultaneously helping the environment

2087662 i vote because im scared that if i dont ill be paying 20 bucks a gallon for some gas in a matter of months lol jk its important to vote because not doing so would be single handedly snatching away our voice no vote no voice no voice no song i sing my song for the woman with sore feet who went against the rules and sat at the front of the bus i sing my song for young children that got sprayed with fire hoses i sing my song for abused amp dominated women i sing my song for shackled slaves i sing my song for me and most importantly for my future children
2087663 it is sooo important to vote especially in this day and age many people especially women have fought for our right to vote and have a say about the future of our country as women we are always affected by who our president because many issues affect us and our children gun control abortion rights education health insurance the list goes on and on if we dont cast our vote and choose we are being complacent and currently letting men make decisions for us vote vote vote especially this time we need change so we can get out of the recession improve the economy and spend money on important stuff like makeup

2087670 aside from being demeaning to the law enforcement officers that uphold the very laws passed by mr gutierrezs congress its potentially dangerous no member of congress should be encouraging the public to defy or demean federal law enforcement officers words matter
2087671 what happens is the public image of you becomes one of not this compassionate law enforcement agency but essentially a gestapo type agency that is knocking on doors

2087692 the sentiments recently expressed by the archbishop of canterbury and the lord chief justice concerning sharia law are very telling in the rush to be tolerant or sensitive to religious difference they create the space for the most reactionary and even fundamentalist religious leaders to take control of minority communities and they enable a climate which allows religion to define our roles in both private and public spaces

2087710 i always said to myself i have unfinished business with limerick someday i have to write the real book and then watch out
2087711 i have to write a book about what has happened to me since i wrote angelas ashes because if i was an ordinary teacher in new york i wouldnt be here nobody pays any attention to teachers
2087712 but i wrote a book and next thing it became an international bestseller and i didnt expect that
2087713 it had what you might call a mixed reaction in limerick i was promised my throat would be slit if i ever came back here but my throat is still intact so maybe they were just joking
2087714 i did ask him before to come on the tour and he said mike i wrote the book

2087717 in each breeding session they will lay up to 100 eggs
2087718 for gardeners its a nightmare as they love the cabbage and lettuce or any plant that lives in the shade theyll demolish basil plants actually if they eat a lot of basil they end up with a lovely basil flavour
2087719 the thing is that they can eat something poisonous like ivy if you want to detoxify them put them in a container and feed them oatmeal once you see that they are fully digesting and excreting the oatmeal youll know that they are clean you can feed them basil then very tasty
2087720 i recommend scattering eggshells or sand and grit around your plants snails dont like slithering over these also they dont like copper for some reason copper wire around a plant pot is very effective
2087721 insecticides like blue pellets can be eaten by birds so youd want to avoid them
2087722 they need water to lay eggs but they also have to bite the female needs mammal blood so her eggs will hatch
2087723 have you ever considered what your last words to family and friends might be
2087724 were all going to die at some point and we cant take anything with us but we can all leave some of the knowledge and wisdom gained during our lifetimes to help those we leave behind
2087725 when you read their last words in this context you realize that they were intended to help guide us in the last days and that their words are as relevant to us today as they were when these great men of god wrote them
2087726 at my new school students didnt value education like they did at bates
2087727 kids bullied me for taking education seriously and for the way i talked
2087728 would turn things around and get back into bates academy
2087729 i was nervous and apprehensive about going back to bates because i didnt want the same thing to happen like it did in fourth grade
2087730 i have chosen to attend yale because it is an excellent school and it was one of the better choices academically and financially
2087731 it also looks good when yale is on a r sum
2087732 just getting into yale is a sign of a students academic merit because its extremely competitive
2087733 ive always been interested in health and biology i was at an engineering program at michigan state that gave medical scenarios and you had to problem solve and figure out what was wrong and that is when i gained the interest in becoming a biomedical engineer
2087734 was involved in a number of activities and had a strong social conscience
2087735 im looking forward to expanding my knowledge at yale but i am a little nervous
2087736 i cant think of words to describe how proud i am of my son
2087737 regardless of what happened to her she really fits the pattern of hundreds of others that amnesty international has documented where people disappeared and ended up in us custody
2087738 ive interviewed detainees who said there was a woman at bagram in 2003 and 2004
2087739 theres strong evidence to support the idea that there was a woman but no one ive spoken to knew who that woman was

2087742 hopefully the people that bought these have a nice house for me to buy in about a year nice to see something is closing
2087743 i dont see the point in bringing in laws if we dont use them when theyre required
2087744 were making progress but we have to look at the extent of the problem
2087745 were making sure the laws are enforced and fife uses a wide range of devices to stop anti social behaviour
2087746 but even in fife they asbos are a fairly small part of our methods
2087747 we dont look forward to increasing the numbers of orders etc we hope by introducing these measures that incidents will fall
2087748 if you were dealing them out like sweeties people might feel that but if you use them as a last resort people do shape up and you find they dont want to be associated with that
2087749 people are coming forward and telling us that things are happening for the better and they can see the benefits
2087750 i would like to see and this is very much a personal view fixed penalty notices to apply not only to under 16s but also to the parents of under 16s
2087751 i think it would be a very effective tool if its brought forward
2087752 become fashionable to blame everything from high gas prices to high food prices on the production of ethanol
2087753 ethanol is a good bridge on the road to a future free of fossil fuels
2087754 the fact is corn based ethanol production has a very small impact on food prices
2087755 it definitely has its advantages some people think its adorable others are like can you repeat that
2087756 cmon darling the australian in me just jumped right in there

2087762 in light of increased trading by hedge funds and more scrutiny around transparency and risk management the prime brokers contacted us to help with a solution to make sure trades can be matched on trade date
2087763 currently at the end of the day hedge funds submit their trades to their prime brokers then both the executing broker and the prime broker send those trades to their local settlement agents
2087764 from a cost and risk management point of view this is not ideal
2087765 this is not a brand new system its an extension of an existing matching system we operate
2087766 so far the system covers foreign exchange money market and derivatives but now it will extend into equities and fixed income

2087793 it looks like moderate drinking has been increasing heavy drinking is down a little bit and total alcohol consumption is down a little bit
2087794 it is encouraging news that more people are drinking moderately and the average intake is coming down rather than shooting up
2087795 it generally tends to reflect trends within the country among middle class white americans
2087796 people drank about a third more back in the 50s and 60s than they did in the 70s up to 2004
2087797 at the same time theres been a decrease in beer and an increase in wine consumption among people but the average intake has decreased
2087798 the data are very clear that light to moderate drinking without binge drinking is generally good for health whereas a larger amount of binge drinking is bad it looks like in this population its going in the right direction

2087839 the figures dont necessarily mean that things are getting worse there is a large pool of undetected infection in scotland
2087840 a large number of cases are still being diagnosed for chlamydia and this possibly reflects a growing awareness of the condition that prompts more people to come forward for a test
2087841 in addition to this the tests used when detecting chlamydia today are more sensitive to those used in 2000
2087842 the ability of gum services to test detect and treat more people can only work towards improving the situation
2087843 the rise in numbers generally can therefore be viewed in a positive light

2087914 the liberation of iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror we have removed an ally of al qaida and cut off a source of terrorist funding

2087945 we found that the actual incidence of gastrointestinal gi bleeding would make it an uncommon complication
2087946 but when it does arise it appears to be associated with increased death and disability
2087947 one of the key points we want to raise is that people are generally prone to developing medical complications with stroke
2087948 and as part of that larger observation we know that among these complications are gi issues and we feel that this is particularly important because gastrointestinal bleeding is a complication that is potentially modifiable with various treatment strategies
2087949 having a poorer outcome in stroke patients with gastrointestinal bleeding is not surprising at all
2087950 but i dont know based on this kind of a retrospective study if we can tell how preventable this is as there are all sorts of things that the researchers may not be measuring that might affect the results
2087951 we treat all our stroke patients with preventive prophylactic therapy to prevent gi bleeding and our experience is that gi bleeding is a rare event so its really not something we get too concerned about
2087952 and that means that the fact that this study shows an increased risk of death associated with gi bleeding says to me that a gastrointestinal problem is simply a marker for someone who is a lot sicker not an independent factor directly related to the stroke itself
2087953 so i dont think this finding gives us much useful new information

2088213 most of our collective history is going to represent a proud past
2088214 through the 1970s 80s and 90s we have been on a journey of deploying great systems of record
2088215 it began in the 70s with the mainframe and its bespoke systems
2088216 on 1 january we woke up and said were full and we slowed down the spending so that we could absorb it all
2088217 the move is away from systems of record towards productivity applications of course this is what we have supposed to have been doing for the past 30 years but we were lying it was marketing we did make the systems of record more productive but they dont make you or your customer more productive no one sat down in front of an oracle or an sap application and said wow ive never been so productive you were still a slave to a system of record that puts you through hoop after hoop
2088218 firstly we move from a compute centric paradigm to a communication centric paradigm
2088219 now we start at the moment of user interaction and work back we start with the moment of truth when the customer is making a purchase or someone is checking for a lost bag at an airline you work back from that moment of truth and work out how to inform that moment
2088220 secondly we realise that this is not about transactional processing were now in a world where the analytical information is more important than the transactional information we all carry mobile devices that put us in the communications moment of truth were not only transacting were interacting its less about reporting much more about search the google isation of our personal lives is showing how powerful this is but the enterprise is the last bastion of not being google ised thirdly is the move from wired to unwired
2088221 were now in a world where the analytical information is more important than the transactional information
2088222 we see analytics becoming more and more critical to users
2088223 what they need complements the it investment especially analytics in real time
2088224 for the past three years weve worked with 150 of our customers to redesign our crm we learned from some very tough conversations users have a lot more power today in lots of these meetings we see users deciding which applications and which productivity applications they will use they have to be more analytical they have to be more communications centric it can be frustrating users can be fickle you talk to one group of users who say we dont want that consistent user interface we want this one they say why do i have to browse why not text then you go to another group in the same company and they want to browse
2088225 we are taking on a new audience whether we like it or not

2088242 i would say that the esa is still very viable and the association is really needed
2088243 because of that couple of weeks of discontent between the associations i think people are under the false impression that we want to see anything bad happen to the esa and that is not at all the case
2088244 i think a strong and vibrant esa is really important to the sector as a whole as far as their membership going forward they have some really big challenges ahead of them and its a difficult time so the show will probably be one of the things that the current membership is looking at in terms of value proposition

2088286 it was a level we couldnt even match from the first minute to the last minute he said
2088287 they geelong used the ball well and they moved the ball quickly they were intent and the first quarter was all about them and it was almost boys playing against men bigger bodies around the ball better decisions kicking easy goals in conditions that were slippery
2088288 it was incredibly disappointing on a very important night for the melbourne football club they really made us look second rate
2088289 i think if you have a look at the game youd have to say they were he said

2088449 pre competition stretching became controversial due to what has been reported as decreases in performance however future research still needs to determine how these stretching exercises may impact athletes
2088450 durations of stretching at or less than eight minutes may not significantly alter lower leg strength
2088451 our findings in conjunction with previous studies suggest that for these muscles there may be a threshold of stretching between eight and 10 minutes that would be necessary to decrease muscle strength

2088477 more and more investors are coming to the conclusion that this could be a much more protracted economic downturn than had originally been thought
2088478 the views that oil prices could only go onwards and upwards have been obviously turned around on expectations now that softer growth will result in some reduction in demand for commodities
2088479 at least temporarily this is a commodity play our currency is viewed as a proxy for commodity prices and oil is the bellwether here

2088536 here is my suggestion not meant to stifle anybodies creativity but just something to describe the project start with a bone stock 4x4 super cab or crew cab single rear wheel long bed pickup with a automatic transmission it probably has 3 73 gears these are very common truck configurations pre 2000 trucks might be better as they start out with single shot injectors although a later model tranny may be better pay your money and take your chances for now say the money limit is 8 000 over and above the cost of the truck maybe we can agree on a different number but for now my initial thoughts for mods gear vendor overdrive 4 000 installed gives you the equivalent of 2 68 1 gears on demand good for 3 mpg transmission mods 1 500 installed needed to tolerate the stress of prolonged low rpm 1 450 rpm 70 mph driving and to allow extensive on demand coasting soft flat tonneau 500 cleans up the aerodynamics a lot but is very flexible for bed loads good for 1 5 mpg unless you drive exclusively in the city stock wheels with mooneye covers 100 bfg longtrail tires 245 75 aired up to sidewall max rating 1 200 bfg long trails are the lowest rolling resistance tires i know of in this size range re align front end to zero camber and toe in 100 shorty air dam to bottom of front axle pumpkin 50 pyrometer and aic 300 helps adjust the nut behind the wheel adjusting driving style free and priceless there you go boys 7 750 total my guess is this truck will show a 5 6 mpg improvement over bone stock but is still perfectly usable for hauling you may have to roll up the tonneau for the four wheeler and towing shut off the gv on steep hills operations you still have the four wheel drive when you want it the truck has not been lowered it will look fairly stock to the casual observer the mooneyes are a giveaway but nothing else really shows a 5 mpg improvement puts most trucks as described into the 20 mpg range my cost estimates may be off but i doubt if by too much

2088631 even when women are facing a breast cancer diagnosis they are still concerned about caring for everyone else especially the emotions of others
2088632 even telling someone i have breast cancer its well thought out
2088633 women are trying to protect older aging parents and younger children and even their spouses even during illness women are socialized to care about others
2088634 its a time they should be caring about themselves what decisions they should be making about breast cancer they shouldnt emotionally burn themselves out by caring for others emotions
2088635 we tell women to seek out other breast cancer survivors other women who understand to increase their resources

2088646 we are hoping for the opportunity to introduce the small four passenger mitsubishi i miev to pg amp es fleet in the fourth quarter of this year so that we can begin real world u s testing the joint partnership will yield valuable data and a greater appreciation of the practicality of an all electric vehicle in california
2088647 pg amp e has been researching the benefits of electric vehicles since the nineties partnering with automakers like mitsubishi is vital to developing compatible infrastructures to support electric vehicles in the marketplace and ensure responsible integration with the grid
2088648 by working with mitsubishi we will both benefit from a free exchange of electric vehicle information that includes charging infrastructure availability vehicle data vehicle commercialization expectations and public feedback

2088651 ill never say eating well is a cure for ms alone because it isnt i want to stress this because it is not designed to replace nhs treatment and advice
2088652 every day i live with the fear that ill wake up one morning and not be able to walk or cuddle my son in the morning and this is what makes me so passionate to stick to the diet so strongly
2088653 eventually i want to sell my own just4joco products possibly through local supermarkets
2088654 i found it very hard to begin this way of eating because i go to the supermarket and there are a huge number of products that i cannot eat
2088655 i was off work for a couple days when i didnt read one of the food labels properly and it made me quite ill
2088656 this way of eating that im promoting is not just for ms sufferers its for a whole range of people who want to extend their health further and go beyond five a day and make it easier to get healthier and get more out of life
2088657 people eat lunch and feel lethargic afterwards why because they have not eaten good quality food
2088658 i dont have any ms symptoms right now and feel great
2088659 ive been on the diet for over a year and a half and if i breach any of the rules on my website i notice it
2088660 for example if i have vegetable oil i will feel tired half an hour later
2088661 im looking forward to developing the website and making it more comprehensive
2088662 i called it joco because it is old scots for happy content and self satisfied

2088665 despite a softening global economy we delivered solid gains in worldwide sales pc shipments and profits achieving our seventh consecutive quarter of profitable growth with positive operating results in our international business
2088666 initially in torino some of those products were selling only in china now they are selling worldwide
2088667 the user experience is entirely different it helps us address different requirements of international vendors and their expectations for customer satisfaction it taught us how to meet those requirements
2088668 i will tell you that i dont believe in gay marriage but i do think that people who are gay and lesbian should be treated with dignity and respect and that the state should not discriminate against them
2088669 so i believe in civil unions that allow a same sex couple to visit each other in a hospital or transfer property to each other i dont think it should be called marriage but i think that it is a legal right that they should have that is recognized by the state if people find that controversial then i would just refer them to the sermon on the mount which i think is in my mind for my faith more central than an obscure passage in romans thats my view
2088670 under these conditions it is difficult to go to other countries to purchase food and we cannot turn to other countries no country is saying it will give us food now either under these circumstances i believe the only way for us to overcome the food crisis is to attain self sufficiency by producing food on our own
2088671 let us farm effectively on our own to cope with the global food crisis
2088672 we should believe in our strength produce food in our countrys fields with our strength and eat and survive on it this is the only way in short i believe self reliance is the only way to overcome the food crisis
2088673 ill keep fighting for these priorities and working to find a way forward i hope senators will answer the call in september and work together for jobs energy and american families

2088681 the cdc centers for disease control came out in 2000 and said that measles has been eliminated from the united states
2088682 because the 30 to 120 cases per year that were seeing here in the u s were directly linked to imported cases in other words people who had traveled or had been exposed to someone who had traveled
2088683 the current generation of parents of young children dont have the same visceral respect for infectious diseases as prior generations
2088684 the main message from my standpoint is that measles is a bad disease and it is even a bad disease in the developed world
2088685 theres also an incidence of encephalitis direct brain infection of one in a thousand and people can be left with very significant severe sequelae other conditions
2088686 like the 10 month old sickened in hennepin county almost all of the national cases involved patients who were either unvaccinated or werent sure they had been vaccinated
2088687 how do we find better workplaces by asking the people who actually work there
2088688 thats when i realized its all about the work environment
2088689 most people are flexible about the work they do its the place that makes the difference
2088690 we believe these risks combined with the higher capital costs and longer construction schedules of nuclear plants as compared to other generation facilities will make lenders unwilling at present to extend long term credit
2088691 without loan guarantees we will not build nuclear power plants
2088692 in todays capital market governments can have only about as many nuclear plants as they can force taxpayers to buy
2088693 new nuclear power is so costly that shifting a dollar of spending from nuclear to efficiency protects the climate several fold more than shifting a dollar of spending from coal to nuclear indeed under plausible assumptions spending a dollar on new nuclear power instead of on efficient use of electricity has a worse climate effect than spending that dollar on new coal power
2088694 when you start taking about building new nuclear you are draining the capacity that the government has to develop other energy such as solar wind geothermal and biomass
2088695 money going into nuclear is subsidizing something with lots of extra costs security fuel storage potential health risks
2088696 unfortunately there isnt a lot of awareness that this is a taxpayer liability when i talk to people outside of the policy field they are not aware how much government provides to the nuclear industry

2088706 sheep and cattle constitute 11 per cent of australias total greenhouse gas emissions

2088725 because of the start of the summer holiday for members of parliament
2088726 it is difficult to gather members of the iraqi parliament during the remaining days of the current month of august because of the presence of family connections to members of parliament as well as the presence of foreign affairs of many activities for them in a number of countries around the world
2088727 members of the house of representatives of the iraqi sacrificed month summer vacation after their scheduled expiration of the current legislative approval to the electoral law and therefore it is impossible to hold a special meeting to approve the election law to limit the duration of the leave enjoyed by the iraqi parliamentary which did not exceed the month

2088761 mispronunciation is more than a challenge its also a danger
2088762 if you pronounce it wrong you may end up with the wrong drug
2088763 as drugs proliferate they start to sound alike like celexa and celebrex
2088764 its just going to get worse with increases in the number of drugs and in the number of unfamiliar names
2088765 as far as pronunciation of words my experience is that its pretty much all over the place
2088766 even if you were pronouncing something correctly if you had a really deep southern drawl its not going to sound the same or if you come in with an english accent or a french accent or a texas accent you may be pronouncing it correctly but its not going to sound the same
2088767 i thought this guys just mispronouncing this terribly and hes the speaker but he actually studied under the guy who discovered the drug

2088785 true that it was not easy to read and accurately portray the personality of montini paul vi which was characterized by an intense strong and elevated spirituality jealously guarded by him and managed by his unmistakable style of gentleness
2088786 perhaps the press at that time did not take into account that paul vi took the second vatican council by the hand after its first session bringing it to a positive conclusion and promulgating all of the approved documents dedicating personal attention and precise interventions to the final approval
2088787 who desired to follow the steps of christ in the holy land and who visited all of the continents for the first time he is also the pope of ecclesiam suam populorum progressio octogesima adveniens evangelii nuntiandi just to name a few of his documents
2088788 the only pope to promulgate an apostolic exhortation on joy gaudete in domino 1975
2088789 august 6 1978 in castel gandolfo the 81 years of paul vi quietly ended
2088790 despite tenacious opposition and grave dissent in the church despite the merciless attacks and criticisms multiplied above all after the credo of the people of god and after humanae vitae paul vi never renounced the authentic magisterium and in reflecting on his pontificate he declared he had put everything at the service and defense of the truth and therefore he was always willing to defend human life
2088791 we had some goal line and short yardage scrimmages it was real real physical it was a good opportunity for a bunch of guys to get some reps young guys and older guys

2088793 guys have the tempo down and they understand what we need to get done we are running a lot of plays but with it being a two a day today we backed off a little in the morning and a little in the afternoon
2088794 it will likely just be some 12 play scrimmages well probably get between 80 and 90 plays of good work with it being the first scrimmage then the next week well add on and well go from there

2088813 when you go to most chain restaurants ordering off the kids menu is a nightmare
2088814 right now kids meals are almost all unhealthy meals when they should be almost all healthy meals
2088815 at the very least restaurants should list calories on the menu so that parents can navigate through this minefield of calories and fat to find the healthy options
2088816 there have been a lot of changes to our restaurant menus especially childrens meals more and more options are available restaurants are offering low fat milk yogurt apples and vegetables as part of the childrens menu they are helping parents help their children make wise choices when they dine out
2088817 kids meals can be outrageously high in calories fat and sodium but its possible to go into just about any restaurant and cobble together a healthy meal for a child if the childrens menu doesnt look healthy you have to look elsewhere
2088818 eating out is no longer a special occasion its a lifestyle now so we have to be more selective about what we eat
2088819 this is a wakeup call that parents need to take advantage of restaurants healthier options especially if kids are going to be eating out three or more times a week
2088820 most kids dont clean their plates so they are probably not eating all these calories

2088837 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
2088838 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties
2088839 you can imagine this liquid looking like mercury only less reflective
2088840 high temperatures make the atoms jiggle around and so people thought that raising the heat would deflect the electrons like putting enough rocks in a stream to block the flow of water

2088850 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain

2088874 its going to be quite daunting because i would say the dogs are slightly more aggressive than cockatiels
2088875 huskies are still wild animals at the end of the day and weve been told you have to show them whos boss
2088876 in such extreme conditions tempers can fray among teams of humans and its the same for the dogs they can start fighting among themselves so you have to be cautious
2088877 i saw a programme on tv recently where they had to split up fighting huskies with a whip hopefully it wont come to that
2088878 a peck from a cockatiel is nothing compared to a bite from a husky so ill have to be on my guard
2088879 its a huge challenge but id actually rather do this than be sunning myself on the beach
2088880 ive been told to bring a sleeping bag that will withstand minus 25 degrees and my team have to be prepared to pull the sledges ourselves if the dogs get too tired so it certainly wont be a walk in the park

2088901 the reason the book came about is because katrina chambers and i were sitting at the pool one day and just dogging this girl out for no apparent reason we didnt know her from a hole in the wall all we knew is that she looked better than us and that pissed us off laughs so the only way to make us feel better was to find things wrong with her and after we sat there laughing at each other we were like we gotta write a book about this it took us 10 years altogether we would start and stop and what would get us going again is something new would happen and wed say see this needs to go in the book it was easy to write because after you sit there and think about situations and the different things youve done you can laugh about it because youre making a change i still see women that i just think are gorgeous that i get pissed off at but i can control it and know and im not making somebody else feel bad just because i feel bad with age i can see past the incident and see what caused it i dont feel as attacked or bothered by it
2088902 we had a couple of focus groups inviting people over in a casual setting to talk about what theyve been through people even went to the website from different countries and let me just say this all the little excerpts that made their way into the book we had to clean them all up laughs the harpercollins blog has been just filled with entries since the book came out last month because its a powerful subject that people have to deal with thats been going on since the days of cain and abel you have your brother hating on you because he feels that your father cared about you more so youve gotta find something wrong with him and make him feel bad just because you feel so disrespected some people will seriously hate another woman just because she looked at them funny but they dont even know them lele and coko read the book and coko really loved it at the end she actually apologized to me because she didnt realize how mean she was being in the early days that we would sing together i was always considered the nice one and the girls felt resentful toward me because they felt like no one ever complains about taj and the things she does shes not perfect i never claimed to be but i was well behaved and nice to people thats just my personality but they felt like they were being attacked and they took out that frustration on me i thought it was strange because i wasnt the one calling them mean you know coko apologizing was just a feather in the cap because if it can reach her it can reach anybody
2088903 were still doing shows but were not gonna record again cokos doing gospel now so she feels a conflict doing both secular and sanctified music theres still a demand so were doing the spot dates across the country all throughout the year but we wont technically record any new songs together
2088904 through our organization we host fundraisers and speaking to women and children affected by domestic violence that subject is very dear to me because i was a victim of domestic violence in my childhood and with a couple of past boyfriends i tell the women and the children about everything ive been through that even taj from swv whos sold millions of records and been all over the world got whupped my ex boyfriend used to beat me like it was for batting practice it wasnt nice my stepfather was a drug addict to the tenth power who used to beat my mother in front of us theres just so much more out there for these women who think that theres nowhere else to go but into those situations so i show them that they can succeed
2088905 i tell that i did find my prince but he was a frog in the beginning laughs i cant testify that ive met a perfect man because i dont believe one exists but what you need to do is find someone that you believe is the closest to what you expect in a man and clean him up because hes probably doing the same thing with you believe me i had to kiss my frog several time to get him to change laughs but hes a man of god and a stand up individual im not perfect and stumble everyday but he appreciates me and my flaws before we were married there used to be a website dedicated to just hating on me talking about why you you like her shes this and shes that but he loves the goodness in me as well as the outside theres a stereotype to these athletes like theyre supposed to be with these super glamorous women i guess im not considered that to his fans but he wanted a real woman someone he could grow with and lean on instead of whats quick and flashy on the arm
2088906 the hating isnt as flamboyant with boys as it is little girls but its still there my son stutters and he gets picked on a lot about that but i just explain that he shouldnt let their ignorance decide how hes going to be my niece is 13 and she has a disease that made her hair fall out and the girls just teased her to death she even got her wig ripped off of her shes going through counseling now and my sister took her out of that school
2088907 for every action theres a reaction so youve got to investigate where thats coming from maybe that womans had a horrible day and when you said something you triggered a bad memory so the spiral continues were not telling people to change were just saying that you need to look at yourself and what youre doing to cause it it may not even be you but how can you judge someone else when youre wrong its just a fun light hearted book and we hope that it helps people to see things in a better way and look within themselves as well

2088915 like jet skiing or hiring a motor scooter for the first time
2088916 the types of holidays people are taking now is resulting in more policies extending the coverage they provide to include activities that previously may have been excluded
2088917 that said if people are intending on going to somewhere more exotic or participating in more hazardous activities then they should look at the policy wording more carefully as coverage for these types of holidays varies dramatically from policy to policy
2088918 i recently spoke to a travel specialist who operates one of the best internet travel insurance websites in the uk and he said less than 0 1 of their customers access the policy wording prior to purchasing the policy

2088925 its a big topic we all know there are certain types of traders who are looking to lever off of liquidity and they do it in the open market they do it on the nyse and nasdaq and thats been around a long time
2088926 these new dark liquidity pools and atss alternative trading systems just offer a new venue to do that
2088927 the key is that your general institutional investor may not want its flow exposed to those types of counterparties so our job when we build a pool is to build in anti gaming logic to protect the quality of the venue

2088945 decir que est abandonada es suponer que deba ser acogida por alguien lo que va en contra de mi concepci n de lo que debe ser una clase media basada en su propio esfuerzo y emprendimiento y no esperando d divas del gobierno as que la expresi n me parece en lo objetivo err nea y en lo subjetivo equivocada porque suena como si nosotros tambi n queremos coger una parte de la torta
2088946 es cierto que a la clase media le caen m s gabelas responsabilidades y pesos que a otros sectores la clase media paga impuestos que los de abajo no pagan y los de arriba muchas veces se los sacan tiene que pagar colegios por circular por las carreteras tiene que pagar por todo y como tiene menos ingresos que los sectores altos se siente oprimida

2088962 veterans that were exposed to agent orange during the vietnam war have a twofold higher risk of prostate cancer
2088963 the cancer they get tends to be more aggressive a higher grade and is more likely to spread or have spread at the time that they present to their urologist
2088964 a lot of veterans dont get their care through the va veterans administration
2088965 this message needs to go out to their physicians and their urologist in the private community to know that this is a large risk factor
2088966 i can almost guarantee youre going to find more cases of prostate cancer
2088967 im not saying that there is not possibly some relationship but i dont think that this paper necessarily proves it
2088968 but i think you could pick almost any exposure and increase screening and you are going to find more cases whether or not the agent is responsible for more cases or not
2088969 the finding is provocative but its hard to know how to interpret it unless it can be replicated in other studies

2088997 it shows the limitation of using autologous cells and underlines the value of allogeneic stem cells
2088998 exciting and underscore the extremely bright future for this cutting edge technology
2088999 the positive outcomes in this trial pave the way for randomized multi centre clinical trials using mesoblasts allogeneic or unrelated donor cells
2089000 good results are likely to be seen with allogeneic cells as there should be reproducibility of outcomes and enhanced dosage predictability using a batched product derived from a young healthy donor
2089001 these results clearly show that our proprietary stem cell technology is safe and effective for speeding up bone fracture repair
2089002 there is a clear need for a minimally invasive highly effective therapy to accelerate fracture repair and treat or prevent non union and we believe that mesoblasts technology is ideally suited to deliver such a product
2089003 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2089004 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2089005 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
2089006 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field i am excited about welcoming brett deanna and their family to the jets organization
2089007 its in everyones best interest to do it quicker than later
2089008 i wont say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
2089009 we respect bretts decision that he could no longer remain here as a packer
2089010 but there were certain things we were not willing to do because they were not in the best interest of the team we were not going to release him nor trade him to a team within the division when brett ultimately decided that he still wanted to play football but not in green bay we told him that we would work to find the best solution for all parties involved we wish brett and his family well

2089018 to light the cauldron li was lifted to the top of the stadium on a guidewire and appeared the run along the top edge of the stadium a spectacular visual effect as he circled the roof holding the torch pictures the torch relay he was concluding filled the panels as he passed it was arguably the most spectacular way to light a cauldron ranking near the archer that lit the flame in barcelona in 92 and held the crowd in thrall next the sky filled with a magnificent display of fireworks and the effect was complete
2089019 prepare to be astonished by any standard the opening ceremony in beijing will surpass any start to any games in history the most expensive opening ever was four years ago in athens when the greeks spent a reported 30 million on their torch lighting rite the chinese have surpassed them by a factor of 10 with an estimated 300 million budget a seemingly never ending cast of 15 000 and a fireworks display thats rumored to be the biggest in history the birds nest will redefine olympic spectacle

2089093 it is not exactly known who created the concept of reproductive health and how
2089094 the concept of reproductive health is becoming accepted by leaders politicians and doctors without any basis or further questioning
2089095 other intentions are hidden under the umbrella of reproductive health
2089096 such as forced sterilizations the hiding of information about the abortifacient nature and side effects of some contraceptives the arguing that pregnancy begins with the implantation of the fertilized egg and not a conception for example in order to approve the morning after pill and the passage of heath care laws that prevent doctors from having recourse to conscientious objection
2089097 sexual rights reproductive rights sexual health the legalization of abortion gender gender perspective sexual diversity homosexual marriage and emergency contraception
2089098 in order to give social and legal legitimacy to the idea of reproductive health

2089104 unless you look at a control group of some kind you may be misleading about whats really happening
2089105 we actually have remarkably few evolutions that have a comparison group of any kind so the evidence on pay for performance is rather spotty the programs weve evaluated over the last five years have been largely unimpressive in their results

2089110 hoy d a se ha ido un hombre bueno bueno subrayado el bueno
2089111 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
2089112 apart from the odd speeding car buildings landscape and walls around us all move past us at slow and predictable speeds our brains are constantly building up a statistical picture of the world around and based on experience it is a statistically slow world
2089113 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
2089114 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience
2089115 capitalizing on natures design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems further knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences
2089116 we came to kirkuk in our attempt to overcome the crisis and dispel the fears and suspicions that the kurds are trying to impose their monopoly and to maintain for it must be a city of peaceful and fraternal coexistence among all nationalities
2089117 the kurdish claim kirkuk does not mean the abolition of an iraqi city nor accept that we impose any specific agenda nor do we wish that we will also impose the same thing but kirkuk should be a model for fraternal union and peaceful coexistence under the constitution especially article 140
2089118 there are those who want to cancel this article of the iraqi constitution as some want the abolition of the constitution essentially and that means ending the political process to resolve the government and thus ending iraq
2089119 there is a conspiracy to eliminate the new regime in iraq from exploiting the issue of kirkuk through the development of the obstacles the united ongoing political process and claimed the arabs and turkmen to find a consensual solution to the city away from outside interference
2089120 article 24 of the electoral law approved in contrast to the iraqi constitution the only solution to the problem of kirkuk is the application of article 140 of the constitution
2089121 it is time that the crown where the strong eat the weak and we all live together on this earth
2089122 the official legion field time is 12 30 its 45 minutes to kickoff

2089124 we are excited about the opportunity to be a part of midlothian and the surrounding communities
2089125 we look forward to serving people and churches by providing them with biblical solutions for life
2089126 that four great nations flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason
2089127 they havent merited much discussion in the presidential campaign nor are we as a nation riveted by the trial of the first defendant instead of a landmark case one that serves as a resonant reminder of the gulf separating us from our enemies we have detachment and ambiguity not just about the extent of hamdans guilt but also about the wisdom of the entire tribunal process as well as many other aspects of the prosecution of the war on terror
2089128 we never suggested he was in the top 17 or the top any teen of al qaeda i dont want to have anybody have us appear to be asserting that hes more responsible than he is or that hes higher ranking than he is
2089129 mr hamdan is being tried on accusations of conspiracy and material support of terrorism and the bush administrations military commission system itself is on trial
2089130 met diagnostic criteria for post traumatic stress disorder and major depression
2089131 nightmares intrusive thoughts memories and images amnesia for details of traumatic events lack of future orientation anxiety irritability insomnia poor concentration and memory exaggerated startle responses and hypervigilance
2089132 kept in isolation 24 hours a day with his hands and feet restrained and armed soldiers prompted him to talk by kneeing him in the back
2089133 repeatedly tied him up put a bag over his head and knocked him to the ground
2089134 highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
2089135 we need to evaluate to what extent it has an impact on our ability to fully portray his criminality in this case but also what it might set out for future cases
2089136 are built to make full advantage of statements obtained from detainees
2089137 is the only place in the world where he has not informed suspects of a right against self incrimination
2089138 committed terrorists off the street and out of the airlines and out of nuclear power plants and out of ports across this country and across other countries
2089139 cooperative cordial and a source of reliable information about the terrorist hierarchy
2089140 drew maps to al qaeda training camps and compounds for his captors
2089141 guided fbi and military intelligence agents to bin ladens private residences and guest houses and identified photos of terrorist kingpins still at large
2089142 built a trusting relationship with hamdan during the marathon interrogation bringing him special snacks and working to ease his concerns
2089143 mr hamdan commented that he liked mcdonalds fries and we brought fries in
2089144 grew upset and uncooperative when he was put in solitary confinement amid a series of interrogations prompting a heated complaint by crouch to military guards
2089145 hamdans mood lifted when he was allowed to call and tell his wife that he was alive
2089146 he was very grateful for the opportunity to speak to his wife a burden had been lifted from him at least his wife knew he was alive
2089147 unaware that during the night hamdan was also brought to interrogators of another u s agency
2089148 without people like mr hamdan bin laden would enjoy no support he would not enjoy protection and he probably would not have been able to elude capture up to this point
2089149 did anyone ever say youve got to understand somebody can use this against you
2089150 the head of bin ladens bodyguards hamdans boss and an al qaeda errand boy arrested along with hamdan
2089151 refused to cooperate with u s interrogators during their time at guant namo were eventually released without being charged
2089152 its perverse that the only person who agreed to cooperate is being hung with his own words while those who stayed silent are home and free
2089153 you think all of this stuff about torture is going to make people want to come to us
2089154 thats why i get upset when i hear people talking about stress positions loud music and dogs
2089155 harrowing both for what they depict and for the fact that they were admitted into evidence at all
2089156 show hamdan slumped on the floor hooded and shackled as he is badgered by his arabic speaking military interrogator in a dark room with one dim light bulb overhead an armed soldier is behind hamdan the interrogator in front
2089157 there is a sickening sense in watching that hamdan visibly scared is searching for the right words to appease the interrogator trying out ideas as they occur to him in an attempt to avoid more abuse
2089158 the dod fears that the american public will know a coercive interrogation when it sees one
2089159 a graphic 90 minute film chronicling the history of al qaeda
2089160 footage of mangled corpses in the rubble of the 1998 us embassy bombing in kenya
2089161 not alleged to have been involved in any of these attacks
2089162 he insisted that he had spoken only with soufan during the more than nine hour interview and that despite soufans persistent questioning on the subject he had never told him about swearing allegiance
2089163 cast a black cloud over these agents and those who work with the detainees
2089164 two largely separate al qaeda missions supporting islamic warriors and committing terrorist acts against enemy foreign states
2089165 it is not the defense that has requested this closed session but it is necessary according to the government to protect the information
2089166 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
2089167 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
2089168 the reason closed sessions are so troubling at guant namo is because the government has so frequently claimed things have had to be classified to cover up abuse and torture in addition trials of this magnitude should have a public record if a significant amount of evidence and witness testimony is classified it will be very hard to trust any verdict
2089169 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
2089170 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
2089171 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personnel we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
2089172 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
2089173 its a great question im not faced with it yet weve thought that through and we have plans to accommodate but ill cross that bridge when i come to it
2089174 the united states would be irresponsible not to continue to detain them until the conflict is over
2089175 whats the purpose here mr hamdan is going to be held until the government wants to release him it really has no connection to the underlying reality
2089176 nat rlich sind wir unglaublich zufrieden begeistert w re vielleicht eine passendere beschreibung dass nintendo auf uns zugekommen ist aber es ist keine exklusive verbindung

2089205 theyre interested in identifying the genetic factors that regulate susceptibility to infection with a certain class of viruses and among those viruses are some which are of public health importance
2089206 in theory if you could identify the genetic factors that make cells susceptible to infection you could do something about that to make people less susceptible
2089207 there are some pathways that are important for both viruses
2089208 were testing other viruses and are hopeful that some of these pathways will be important for the common family of viruses and if so will provide special targets for prevention

2089267 after taking two devastating losses like we did in the last minutes it was good to be able to come back and answer the call when all the adversity was against us and they had the momentum on their side
2089268 i wish we did what we did in the fourth quarter in the third and second quarter and first quarter
2089269 it was a tough one it felt like we were flat we have to find a way to pick it up quicker than we did
2089270 even though we had the momentum they found a way to get a big play there and turn it around
2089271 it was good that we were able to stay poised and composed and go out there when we had the ball on an opportunity to close it out and we did just that
2089272 i know me personally i have a lot of confidence in the guys that play so im not using that as an excuse at all
2089273 as a running back you want the load on your shoulders
2089274 the offensive line played well against a good defence they throw a lot at you we had three rookie offensive lineman they definitely held their ground tonight
2089275 they will have the italian mentality when they defend deep defend together and it will be tough to go forward so that will be a test for us
2089276 we often find at home that teams defend deep make you take the risks and then if its gone well for them they start to look to come forward in the second half
2089277 we havent had a test like that so far in pre season so this is ideal it will be a real test of our attacking play and patience especially if we dont score first
2089278 its the perfect game before the start of the season were looking to play well and make sure everyone comes through it but with the full stadium the players will be determined to win as well

2089327 america should be focusing on viable clean energy solutions like conservation solar and wind

2089428 my faith in his ability has now been amply rewarded as due to his perseverance and local knowledge on court jurisdiction issues the crown have now deserted the case

2089449 in general ne vom axa pe specializarile cu o spitalizare cat mai scurta de una doua zile cu afectiuni care nu prezinta un grad ridicat de risc evitandu se bolile cronice care costa foarte mult dar si urgentele ale caror costuri nu pot fi estimate

2089624 but senator clinton arent you saying i mean general petraeus was in washington you both were there when he testified saying that the gains in iraq are fragile and are reversible are you essentially saying i know better than the military commanders here
2089625 well its common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al qaeda is going back into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran thats well known and its unfortunate so i believe that we are succeeding in iraq the situation is dramatically improved but i also want to emphasize time and again al qaeda is on the run but they are not defeated

2089628 if you look at the fall campaign there are some clear signals from senator obamas opponents that all of these issues are going to be put together in a general argument they all go back to that same theme
2089629 the questions were tough and fair and appropriate and relevant
2089630 we wanted to focus at first on the issues that were not focused on during the last debates
2089631 now of course the liberal blogs are losing their minds in part because i suggested the question to george stephanopoulos tuesday afternoon on my radio show
2089632 part of what we discovered is that sen obama had never been asked directly about it even though its being written about and talked about and republicans are signaling that this is gonna be an issue in the general election
2089633 it was one of the best debates of the entire political season because it addressed substance and character at the same time
2089634 thanks to a surprisingly tenacious set of questions for barack obama and hillary clinton from abc moderators charles gibson and george stephanopoulos barack obama got exposed over and over again as an empty suit while hillary cleaned his clock kudos to abc news for taking on both candidates fearlessly
2089635 the constant hissing of digital white noise only makes relevance that much more valuable a commodity
2089636 were thrilled to welcome these two beautiful animals to our family at the baghdad zoo
2089637 the conservartors centre is proud to contribute these tigers toward the restoration of the baghdad zoo and the important education work it will engage in over the next decade
2089638 after 13 days of the us occupation we found the animals in miserable conditions
2089639 only a few of the bigger animals were still alive such as four lions and three bears
2089640 we have forgotten this matter as it is in the past and the us apologised
2089641 we did not use to come here much but after we heard that there are new animals we wanted to look around especially for our kids
2089642 we really like the tigers and we hope they will bring more
2089643 we want to be able to see the animals alive like other children around the world we want to be happy like other children

2089659 i am really happy with the womens learning center that i attend it is a good and safe educational environment for females before the establishment of this center here the society of this area was against the girls education but fortunately the center has done a great deal to change their minds my parents have not allowed me to go to school and it was very hard for me that my rights have not given to me so when my parent saw that many women and girls go to the womens learning center without any problem and all the teachers there are female they allowed me to go to this center after some time they took another positive step and told me to get admission in the regular school too now i am in grade 7th and i understand if the womens learning center had not been established here i and many other girls would remain illiterate people in the society if that were to happen this society would never change their mind regarding their girls education
2089660 i am so happy that in this age with so many problems at home i could be able to attend the literacy class here i and my small daughter are in the same class i really enjoyed the time that we spend gathered here to learn the teachers are very nice and hard working people i appreciate their hard work and i appreciate the executive director of this foundation for providing this opportunity for us if we did not have this foundation here god knows what would happen to us

2089662 the downfall of the bigger cars was that they were forced to stop so often so while they kept overtaking us we eventually went past them at the next petrol station when they needed to fill up again

2089680 never had an orgasm from anything in 27 years of being married
2089681 the army corps of engineers has control of the bridge and the water both so if they catch you they will cite you and its go to federal court time
2089682 when there is a report of someone jumping off the interstate bridge the departments with boats respond down to make sure there is no one in trouble
2089683 the boats that we see in the water are the asotin county sheriffs boat asotin county fire protection 1 has a response and rescue 1 responds with zodiak boats
2089684 in the last month and a half or so theres been three calls to that area already and yes those costs would add up said cooper
2089685 out of three responses we have come up with nobody in the water
2089686 so it appears that either the jumper has jumped into the water swam to shore and left or its been an unbased call

2089695 my dad was the one who really turned me on to crimson back in the mid 90s when i was listening to a lot of primus and phish i remember spending the better part of one summer just sitting around listening to every recording and reading the fxf and tgd booklets end to end just soaking it all up in addition to absorbing crimson it gave me a reference point to really explore the music of the previous generation

2089703 but the industry didnt do that for the most part instead settling for incremental innovation that wouldnt upset things too much on the legacy side thats exactly the thinking thats in this inquirer memo

2089726 im not going to forget any of you in the locations
2089727 an event of this magnitude is a god sized event
2089728 weve had a lot of people working hard to make this event happen but ultimately everything was in gods hands
2089729 the significance of this event is that women gathered in local churches rather than travel to an arena location
2089730 it truly reinforced what lifeway is all about equipping and strengthening the local church for outreach evangelism and service

2089750 we are going to be in iraq for a long time
2089751 do i think the world is better off without saddam hussein running a country the answer is yes
2089752 if i were in charge we wouldve done things differently
2089753 all the reasons to be for the war turned out to be false
2089754 saddam is a menace his menace grows with each passing day history will judge us harshly if knowing what we know we fail to act with bipartisan solidarity to prevent the death of hundreds of thousands
2089755 removing saddam hussein from the world stage was worth fighting for freeing the people of iraq from tyranny and deprivation is worth fighting for planting an arab democracy in the middle east is an historic opportunity for freedom in this world
2089756 we are committed mr president our only option is to persevere to victory with all people i hope and pray it will be soon
2089757 based on what i knew then i would have made the same decision
2089758 could have would have should have im not in that business
2089759 im in the what do we have to do now to get things right business
2089760 going back do i think that saddam was a threat yes do i think that its better that hes gone yes theres no fresh slate where all questions can be reanswered in the light of new information but if youre asking me whether its a good thing that saddam is gone the answer is yes
2089761 that this country was misled at the time that we were going to war against iraq
2089762 i dont think anyone said the country was misled it was bad intelligence
2089763 i dont know it was interesting watching the debate early on i really dont know you know i call this operation finish desert storm and i you know if i had 10 years ago or 11 12 years ago been asked to vote on that i would have probably said dont and i would have been wrong i think we did the right thing then we probably should have gone to baghdad so i dont know
2089764 the day the war started i did that flip that most americans did and said i just hope they know what theyre doing but were bombing holy sites we didnt even know existed i thought we were supposed to know this place
2089765 as a citizen i regret not going out into the street and protesting the war
2089766 supports the mission that weve been backed into which is to make iraq secure enough to become as western style a democracy as it can be
2089767 does that progress though on the political side this freedom to vote and this turnout by the iraqi people does it justify in some ways the loss of u s lives
2089768 the presidents political difficulties have inspired republicans such as sen norm coleman of minnesota to suggest bush needs to bring fresh blood into the white house bush rejected the idea
2089769 there will be better days in iraq and there will be worse days there will be better days in the war on terror and god willing there will be far fewer worse days but whatever the future brings we must stand with this president and with this nation and its soldiers and diplomats and we must on bended knee pray that our efforts bear the fruit of a more prosperous and more peaceful world
2089770 a decision to go to war is not a stock you buy or sell depending on how it is doing we are in this war until we finish it successfully
2089771 america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country
2089772 america will not be safer if we cut and run from iraq
2089773 shameful outrageous it demands the collective condemnation of all of us that we should give comfort to the enemy because of those seeking to score partisan political points
2089774 john mccain will be a blessing on white flag of surrender in iraq
2089775 i dont know what to do in iraq i dont trust the bush crowd to stay and i dont trust them to leave i want us to succeed in iraq but i dont know if its possible some people think that our presence there creates more chaos and that we should leave other people think leaving will cause a civil war
2089776 franken the president said certain things that he knew were not true
2089777 condi rice said that there was no other no way these nothing that these aluminum tubes could be used for other than centrifuge and uranium she had to know that wasn t true the energy department analysts said that they couldn t be used to centrifuge uranium
2089778 are we going to do what we said we were going to do when we first went there and set up a jeffersonian democracy no thats just not going to happen
2089779 turn and tiptoe out of there declare victory and it will be a disgrace it will leave an incredibly unstable iraq
2089780 ok im cutting off funding because i wont agree to a timetable
2089781 i have never said that you dont provide funding for the troops but that you put the onus on the president and the republicans in the senate and you provide the funding for the troops with a timetable and if the president vetoes it its him cutting off the funding
2089782 the reality is that if you choose the path of cutting off funding youre going to hurt those you want to help i dont have a good answer for you if franken were to follow the course he described he would then be cutting off funding theres no question he would you can make the argument that the presidents also responsible the american people would ultimately be the judge of whos held responsible but franken cant avoid responsibility by saying its really not my decision because ultimately its the presidents decision whether to veto it or not
2089783 we do not have unending patience or an infinite supply of blood and treasure that we will spend
2089784 deeply concerned about the presidents strategy and for american troops caught in sectarian violence
2089785 we are going to be in iraq a long time i am not supporting dates specific dates timetables for withdrawal when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about redeployment they are talking about getting out of iraq im not and simply because thats the reality
2089786 at a lot quicker pace than a lot of us even imagined even six months or a year ago
2089787 they dont really define as far as im concerned what constitutes an acceptable level of stability for us to leave hows this supposed to end
2089788 pro iraqi sovereignty and as anti u s forces as possible the iraqi people are saying they want us out
2089789 we have created a culture of dependency on our presence
2089790 our only leverage over maliki over the sunnis over everyone is to say were leaving and you cant fall back on our presence to say were leaving and set a timeline and start to leave with some flexibility of course dont leave precipitously
2089791 if youre asking me that where were at now is a better place than we were at a year ago or two years ago absolutely
2089792 when the story is told minnesotans will be and should be proud of the sacrifice that our troops have made and i think theyll be proud to say that their sacrifice was worth it at great sacrifice and great cost certainly our troops have made great accomplishments
2089793 knowing everything we know now weve had over 4 100 troops die we have had tens of thousands wounded we have hurt our national security weve hurt our standing in the world weve empowered iran weve recruited jihadists all over the world weve brought al qaida into iraq we have taken our eye off the mission in afghanistan we have made israel more vulnerable how could you think this was anything but an enormous blunder
2089794 this is norm colemans war as much as it is george bushs
2089795 i think its a foolish cheap political comment i dont think most minnesotans would give much credence to was it al frankens war he supported it was it hillary clintons war i dont think most folks are going to listen to that or its going to have any impact
2089796 i think youve talked with read listened to him long enough to know that suggesting al franken was pro war until he ran for senate is patently absurd

2089828 if youre used to playing to crowds of 20 000 or 30 000 people it is quite intimidating when you can actually see everyone in the crowd
2089829 its so intensely quiet this music so detailed you can hear everything its quite nerve racking but then again thats what a performer has to do put himself back in school and learn something new good work is never wasted with me it always feeds into everything else so it was a very enriching experience to sing this kind of stuff
2089830 its quite an antidote to all that smoke and noise and hysteria of the police tour doing the john dowland songs
2089831 its actually good for me they didnt have huge venues to fill when they were playing this music back then people just gathered around tables
2089832 its a fascinating story and one of frustration in that he was a brilliant musician who although incredibly well respected didnt get the accolades he deserved because of his religion
2089833 it was a time when to have a religion was to risk death i wanted to tell that story
2089834 it only became an album when i started to read passages of dowlands letters
2089835 i realised that most people hadnt heard this sort of music before and that they would need some kind of context to listen to it in once we had a context that was historical it made sense
2089836 there is an argument that these songs were written for modern pop singers they also give me a chance to give the songs a little more personal touch be a little more sensuous closer as beautifully as they have been interpreted before theyre a little distant i wanted to bring them closer i think dowland is the father singer songwriter you can trace him all the way through to the beatles
2089837 i recognised something in his music that had a lineage both harmonically and melodically
2089838 economy is a great thing these songs can be played entirely on just voice and lute theres a great deal of space and silence the song in darkness let me dwell is quite an extraordinary song by any standards its so baffling and mysterious and dark i love it
2089839 theres a melancholy strain through that kind of music that my voice lends itself to
2089840 im connected to its melancholy and even fond of its melancholy theres a kind of essential englishness about it too
2089841 its part of my job to put myself in the position of student
2089842 the great thing about music is that you never get to the end of it no matter how much you know theres just more and more and more my modus for many years is to keep learning about music
2089843 im curious about music i tend to listen to more classical music than i do pop music just because i think theres more there to learn from in terms of counterpoint and arranging or whatever but i appreciate pop music
2089844 he is such a great player and an incredible musician he lives and breathes the instrument and he lives and breathes baroque 16th century music and hes an incredible teacher im incredibly fortunate to have him in my life hes brought a great deal to it
2089845 it has 26 strings and all of the problems inherent in that
2089846 its a fascinating mistress but very demanding its close enough to a guitar to really confuse you the tuning and the fingering but im completely hooked i havent played a guitar in ages im totally hooked on the lute
2089847 its been wonderful its been difficult it has been challenging and it has been incredibly successful
2089848 it is like going back to a marriage i dont know if youve ever done that but its not easy at the same time what a wonderful thing to have done were almost at the end of it and i havent strangled the other two and they havent tried to kill me we have our battles and then we make up and then we fight again but we care passionately about the music we all have different ideas about how it should be achieved and realised but its all good
2089849 im loath to call it an opera because im not wearing tights and i dont have the proper voice
2089850 but were singing with a bunch of opera singers again its an experiment and were all ready to be stabbed
2089851 its pretty cool to have a few grand in the bank and its another personal achievement
2089852 i always thought it was possible to win as id seen last years games and i knew we had a good team for this year
2089853 i am a sinner and my only hopes i have pinned to the mercy of christ in that he forgave other sinners and therefore i trust in his mercy not in anything within myself to make me any better than any other person no matter how holy others might perceive them to be

2089861 we do not have a copy of the course paper you requested and neither does columbia university
2089862 a thesis entitled soviet nuclear disarmament written at the height of the cold war in 1983 might shed some light upon what barack obama thought about our most pressing foreign policy issue for 40 plus years u s soviet relations
2089863 you wouldnt say oh hes going to be secretary of state or president someday
2089864 clearly one of the top one or two students in the class
2089865 my recollection is that the paper was an analysis of the evolution of the arms reduction negotiations between the soviet union and the united states
2089866 at that time a hot topic in foreign policy circles was finding a way in which each country could safely reduce the large arsenal of nuclear weapons pointed at the other for u s policy makers in both political parties the aim was not disarmament but achieving deep reductions in the soviet nuclear arsenal and keeping a substantial and permanent american advantage as i remember it the paper was about those negotiations their tactics and chances for success barack got an a
2089867 the course was not a polemical course it was a course in decision making and how decisions got made
2089868 it wasnt a position paper it was an analysis of decision making
2089869 at the time barack obama was a student the political science department had no mechanism by which undergraduate political science majors in columbia college could receive recognition for writing an independent thesis
2089870 the departments procedures for students to write theses were created in the 1990s
2089871 senator obama did not write a thesis in fact columbias political science department didnt even begin offering the option for college undergraduates to write independent credit theses until the 1990s well after obama had graduated
2089872 if obama says he doesnt have a copy i would have to call him a liar
2089873 obama has it or knows where it is but no one has pressed him seriously for it

2089877 actually analysts say a weak economy is causing less energy use resulting in falling oil prices yeah basically the worse the economy the lower the oil prices which means if bush could serve one more term oil would be free
2089878 well barack obama and john mccain have both switched their positions on offshore oil drilling they both used to be against it but now they say they are for it under the right circumstances like if it helps them get elected

2089927 the issue here is consumer confidence it is apparent from our own survey results that some people are adopting a wait and see attitude watching the market before making any decisions which is affecting prices there is no denying that the credit crunch and tighter economic factors have affected confidence in the market but it is still important to remember that the underlying factors that support the property market remain low unemployment historically low interest rates and a latent demand for houses
2089928 when looking at trends in the market it is important to remember that uk house prices are 39 higher than five years ago the current issue affecting the market is fundamentally about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 1990s which was about high interest rates and unemployment

2089937 water as we know it does not exist within our bodies
2089938 water in our bodies has different physical properties from ordinary bulk water because of the presence of proteins and other biomolecules proteins change the properties of water to perform particular tasks in different parts of our cells
2089939 while it is well known that water plays an important role in the folding process we usually only look at the motion of the protein
2089940 this is the first time weve been able to look at the motion of water molecules during the folding process
2089941 water can be viewed as a designer fluid in living cells
2089942 our experiments showed that the volume of active water was about the same size as that of the protein
2089943 we previously thought proteins would affect only those water molecules directly stuck to them
2089944 now we know proteins will affect a volume of water comparable to their own thats pretty amazing
