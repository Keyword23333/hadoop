8790000 special teams stunk it was terrible very disappointing i really felt like with the amount of time i spent on special teams i was disappointed in our play awful special teams
8790001 that play is pretty nasty that they ran two times in a row to get in the end zone they ran a zone read and the quarterback pulled the ball and instead of running it or going with the option which most teams do and they had been doing the wide receiver ran a slant well probably do it next week

8790006 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8790007 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8790008 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8790009 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8790010 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8790011 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind

8790028 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8790029 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy
8790030 i know it has to be sort of hard youre the starting quarterback and youre getting ready to prepare for a season and all everybodys talking about is how a potential freshman can come in and take your job
8790031 i heard todd get asked how do you feel helping a guy out who could potentially take your spot i dont know how you really answer that kind of a question
8790032 hes a great player hes got all the talents in the world to be a great quarterback and im looking forward to seeing what he can do
8790033 i guess experience and me having a previous year last year helps a lot
8790034 he pryor is a great player and if hes going to go out there and play some snaps and do some things out there and if its helping us win im all for it
8790035 last year coming in he had to not only prove to the fans and the world that he could be the starting quarterback but he kind of had to prove it to his teammates and gain our trust
8790036 hes done a good job with that since last year his confidence has grown a lot hes gained the trust of all his teammates we know that he can get it done

8790040 what i discovered is that barack obama is a man of faith a man of values and a man of action someone who has shown his love for america by fighting for our people helping communities left behind on chicagos south side fighting today for working families and the tax breaks we need to purchase a home pay for college and save for retirement

8790092 xvesa is a generic free open source x server for linux on the x86 platform xvesa doesnt know about any particular hardware and sets the video mode by running the video bios in vm86 mode xvesa can use both standard vga bios modes and any modes advertised by a vesa bios if available
8790093 xvesa runs untrusted code with full privileges and is therefore a fairly insecure x server the xvesa server should only be used in trusted environments
8790094 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
8790095 put this in the mtv news headline fat joe says daddy yankee is a sellout
8790096 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
8790097 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
8790098 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
8790099 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos
8790100 we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico
8790101 like i said with me my whole philosophy on blacks and latinos is were all one
8790102 were in the same ghettos same inner cities and were suffering from the same problems every problem the blacks have the latinos have theres two systems of health care the one for the rich thats really good then theres the one for the inner city where they leave ladies in the emergency room unattended for 24 hours until they drop dead people dont even check on her hours after shes dead this is normal stuff this is whats happening in the u s
8790103 my own sister to me she was murdered by doctors
8790104 she was having a baby in the bronx and they gave her an epidural a normal procedure that was supposed to numb her from the waist down they numbed her from the waist up because they had amateurs learning in the bronx hospitals not even real doctors students murdered my sister in the inner city in the bronx i love what barack is doing with the heath care system once he gets universal health care for everybody then we gotta step up our system to make it the best in the world
8790105 im a huge fan of the clintons i love hillary i love bill they hit home runs out the park i was so excited when bill was speaking it reminded me of why i love him hes articulate so smart greatest president of our era when he was here we had peace yasser arafat of palestine and the prime minister of israel shaking hands and hugging bringing peace in the middle east not war everybody had jobs the economy was growing george bush and the republicans turned the whole country around to where our dollar is worth half the euro dollar your man john mccain wants to continue the same tactics of the bush organization why should my man daddy yankee be endorsing mccain this is the only urban guy in the universe to endorse john mccain you got people who look up to yankee young teenagers that look up to him and might make the wrong choice john mccain is the wrong thing to do i dont think the republicans care much about minorities i cant believe yankee went and endorsed this guy
8790106 i travel the world doing shows and people hate the united states because of the policies of george bush
8790107 years ago you would go overseas and the people would praise you and love the united states i feel barack obama is the one person who could bring not just the united states but the world together i was in africa two days ago and i seen people with i love obama on their bumper sticker he just spoke to 200 000 people in germany
8790108 we have to vote and change this country around everybody has to get out there and register im not asking im telling you to go vote im forcing you

8790128 earwax is not intrinsically evil stuff and consequently does not have to be removed merely because its present
8790129 in fact it serves a function and so if you dont need to take it out you should just leave it alone
8790130 and that can increase the likelihood that the wax doesnt come out on its own
8790131 the wax gets much thicker and drier and plus you actually end up with more hair in your ear when youre older and so it traps it
8790132 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8790133 dont put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear
8790134 if theyre going to do something at home they should probably use drops of some sort
8790135 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8790136 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8790137 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8790138 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8790139 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8790140 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8790141 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8790142 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8790143 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8790144 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8790145 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8790146 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8790147 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8790148 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8790149 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8790150 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8790151 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8790152 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8790153 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8790154 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8790155 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8790156 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8790157 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8790158 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8790159 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8790160 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8790161 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8790162 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8790163 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8790164 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8790165 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8790166 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8790167 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8790168 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8790169 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8790170 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8790171 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8790172 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8790173 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8790174 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8790175 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8790176 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8790177 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8790178 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8790179 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8790180 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8790181 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8790182 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8790183 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8790184 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8790185 whatever we believe about abortion we can all agree on
8790186 go forth in the nearby caves of doom and find an old kobold crone living with a small band of kobolds and give her this scroll kill everything else

8790193 she was a single working mother and shes an educator shes not only giving back to the community but she helped her son achieve his ultimate goal she gave to us the greatest olympian of all time
8790194 its about showing that while these people are celebrities and are amazing in their own right they are still every day people who care for their baby and love their baby just as much as an everyday mom does
8790195 we like everyone else in america were glued to the television set during the olympics
8790196 at michaels first race we all recognized immediately that she was wearing chicos we continued to watch the rest of the week to see michael and to see what debbie was wearing
8790197 there isnt a system of psychiatric facilities in this state
8790198 what concerns me is that with a new administration the tendency will be to study the problems
8790199 folks are going to be behind the eight ball and if thats the case well see a perpetuation of the situation
8790200 they felt like if they agreed to do that it would hurt their case i mean theyre suing all these people
8790201 we dont have to go through the record label system
8790202 any new model that goes away from the unit price model creates issues for them
8790203 its depressing because its a good thing its part of a future model
8790204 the artists are ready and willing and the file sharing community has spoken that they want things free
8790205 if its too hard to get legally theyre just going to get it illegally
8790206 the way things are going music is getting devalued its going to have to become less expensive and easier to get
8790207 lil wayne proved that if you give things away for free you can build a fan base before he did that he was just a generic southern rapper but between his last album and his new album hes become the hottest rapper in music
8790208 it will be more appropriate to not only that demographic but to the brand personality that old navy has which is one of its strongest attributes

8790225 the oxygen bottle went from the base of the aircraft to the ceiling of the first floor cabin
8790226 we can relax now but please be cautious they might return soon
8790227 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8790228 from now on it will be stickier our political rallying will get stronger because more of our supporters from upcountry will come to help us we will not back down
8790229 we can withstand any difficult conditions if we can topple samak
8790230 if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated
8790231 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8790232 chnm publications and software are defining digital humanities for the next generation of academics librarians and museum professionals
8790233 an aerial photograph and an orthophoto or orthoimage may look alike but there are several important differences that allow an orthophoto to be used like a map

8790237 we are supposed to take drastic action against whosoever indulges in violence
8790238 can he seriously go abroad and continue to represent new zealand as our minister of foreign affairs
8790239 things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not entered the heart of man all that god has prepared for those who love him 1 corinthians 2 9
8790240 which have not entered the heart of man all that we can build together
8790241 at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8790242 both parties have agreed that nobody should speak with the press until negotiation is concluded but we are asking for something more than the 27 5 per cent increase promised by the governors many non professional teachers are already aspiring to become professionals and this is because nobody wants to miss out of the increment once you are able to obtain a certificate from the college of education you become a professional if you are hardworking you can take sandwich courses in education at the university too
8790243 about 10 000 candidates applied for the recent teachers recruitment exercise in the state and so i dont think we lack teachers in this state in fact we have more than enough and they are mostly professionals
8790244 the basic qualification for teachers in the country is the nigerian certificate in education which every teacher must possess most of the teachers in this state have this basic qualification
8790245 the dual salary scale for professional and non professional teachers will spur non professionals to enroll for remedial programmes
8790246 if you didnt study a course with education bias you are not a teacher you are a mercenary and we dont want mercenaries in the profession go and obtain the necessary qualifications to become a professional teacher
8790247 you can never be as learned as those who were trained to practice that profession which means you will not always enjoy what they enjoy
8790248 the allowances that make up the 27 5 per cent increment are in four categories non professional and professional teachers alike will enjoy three categories of the allowances
8790249 however the allowance that gulps the greatest share of the increment is known as inducement allowance it is 15 per cent of the increment and will only be enjoyed by professional teachers
8790250 if this increment is implemented and reviewed in about a decade the teaching profession will be better
8790251 what does it take just the zeal and determination the union always prevails on the state government to allow teachers to go for the training during holidays most universities offer courses during vacation and teachers should seize this opportunity
8790252 we do not recruit non professional teachers for our primary schools but those in the secondary schools are allowed to take courses to qualify as professionals
8790253 of the 16 497 teachers in our junior and senior secondary schools only five per cent are non professionals
8790254 to avoid poverty in case i dont find a job that pays well

8790256 i wanted to elevate my pool side style the same way that michael has elevated the sport plus there were times when id have to leave the pool and go out for different appearances or events and i needed to be dressed for those things
8790257 i always tell michael understand who your true friends are be very selective about who you hang out with because the one thing you dont want is for your child to be burned or to be used
8790258 i do feel that way just the other day someone came up to me and said hey remember me we had a beer together in athens and the whole time i was thinking no we did not we never did any such thing in athens or people will say im such a huge fan of michaels and ill say really how many meets have you been to and its their first one plus people we dont even know are now saying things in the media its just distasteful really

8790290 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8790291 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8790292 there has been a lot of speculation in some sections of the media which has caused serious distress to the fosters family and friends such speculation is not helpful to our investigation and until we gain access to the house and complete our search and examination we are not in a position to make any further comment on such issues
8790293 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson

8790383 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8790384 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast

8790444 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request

8790449 i think mez is a potentially good young defenseman who had a bit of an off year this past year and weve asked their camp to entertain that in what were trying to do with him
8790450 i think weve made more than a fair offer and put ourselves in a position where he could come here and with some help we think he can be a top player
8790451 we need their camp to help us in that area as well ive tried to get that message across but to this point we havent gotten there

8790455 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8790456 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8790457 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8790458 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8790459 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8790460 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8790461 we can take a different approach to crime prevention rather than reaction

8790475 there has been an explosion inside batticaloa prison seven people have been injured and admitted to batticaloa hospital
8790476 all of them are tamils and most of them are suspected of ltte rebel activities
8790477 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8790478 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8790479 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8790480 move in and circle around me we cant let them seize our stage too easily
8790481 we have told our union members to call a leave of absence to join the rally in bangkok to oust this government which has been damaging the country over the past seven months
8790482 the thunder was so strong and the rain was very heavy too then i smelled the mud thats when i knew this is really quite serious
8790483 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8790484 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8790485 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8790486 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8790487 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8790488 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8790489 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8790490 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8790491 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8790492 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8790493 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8790494 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8790495 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8790496 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8790497 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8790498 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8790499 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8790500 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8790501 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8790502 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8790503 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8790504 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8790505 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8790506 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

8790515 the activities deemed too provocative by adams township have become an increasingly popular form of exercise for women around the country and even in china a country not known for freedom

8790517 we recently received information that would classify your business as an adult business because of the content of your advertising and information from your websites
8790518 she said the classes were designed to increase womens self esteem in a male dominated society she stated that ms babines never offered for sale any sexually explicit material or sex toys during her classes
8790519 he testified that regardless of whether the activity involved nudity the dance forms ms

8790521 we looked into colors and the pink and black are used quite often in gentlemans clubs along with the stiletto heel is used commonly if you go on the internet and look at brand identity it talks about different colors
8790522 red and black are often associated with sexy and seductive and are favored by porn sites
8790523 it doesnt really matter as long as i get my education
8790524 the education being afforded is excellent and parents understand that
8790525 i have no support for that other than the alleged statement of the young man
8790526 may have been in her apartment at least on one occasion
8790527 her father said to me this was our dream for our child she got a great career shes in a nice little community shes in a school where they like her shes teaching at the highest level at the school
8790528 they have whole cloth made up this idea that shes been with groups of young men that story has nothing behind it
8790529 theyre dressed theyre appropriate no one ever said they werent no one every said they were disheveled
8790530 the grand jury learned that during an executive session of borough council piroli made his displeasure known and required that chief joseph deluca remove officer dawn shane from the investigation

8790535 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8790536 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

8790540 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8790541 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8790542 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8790543 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8790544 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8790545 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8790546 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8790547 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8790548 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

8790551 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8790552 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8790553 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8790554 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

8790566 republicans have a post 9 11 worldview and many democrats have a pre 9 11 worldview that doesnt make them unpatriotic not at all but it does make them wrong deeply and profoundly and consistently wrong
8790567 when the eagles are silent the parrots begin to jabber
8790568 the first amendment of the constitution was not written to protect the people of this country from religious values it was written to protect religious values from government tyranny
8790569 today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the right of all who wish to be free
8790570 i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts
8790571 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure

8790586 it is disgraceful that border patrol agents are put in harms way and our government doesnt do everything reasonably within its power to protect us from marauding mexican soldiers and others
8790587 without a forceful response to these illegal incursions an agent will eventually be seriously wounded or killed it is only a matter of time
8790588 the incursions will not stop until the mexican military units and their commanders are held accountable for their actions
8790589 it is a documented fact that the mexican military is corrupt and is involved in protecting drug cartels smugglers and other criminals
8790590 there is an international boundary for a reason and they are to be respected by both governments
8790591 we take very seriously our role in working with our international neighbors to address and resolve these situations
8790592 the fact that the mexican military is operating in such close proximity to the border without any identifiable purpose calls into question its activities and raises concerns about the vulnerability of our southern land border
8790593 when considering the frequency of incursions and the threat these encounters pose to our border patrol agents it is critical that we take the necessary steps to ensure that mexican military and law enforcement personnel do not cross into the u s without our knowledge or consent
8790594 will result in a clearer delineation of the international border
8790595 a reasonable person would conclude that the soldiers knew exactly at whom they were pointing their rifles
8790596 had the agent panicked and fired a shot or attempted to flee in his vehicle there is little doubt the mexican soldiers would have opened fire
8790597 during past incursions the mexican government has denied it had soldiers in the area they have blamed impostors even when military humvees were involved
8790598 time after time they have gotten away with these incursions and time after time our government has not taken a forceful stand against them

8790649 lost 35 509 on the album of the year damnit
8790650 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like no 1 probably not but i cant judge too much on that because i really havent had chance to practice
8790651 this kind of loss i had today is just incentive to work harder to go back on the court and to keep working hard and practicing and improving
8790652 i thought i can slowly get into the match and she played completely different than i expected
8790653 she was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots so i really struggled and made too many unforced errors and my serve was not working really well in the third set i created a lot of opportunities for myself just didnt quite use them that was very very frustrating
8790654 maybe i was a little bit also too hard on myself at some moments
8790655 many people said i have the best draw as i ever had in the last two or three years because i never really had good draws especially in the grand slams
8790656 but that doesnt matter if youre playing well if youre doing the right things doesnt matter if you have a good or bad draw youre going to go a long way
8790657 ouhk still represents a breakthrough for education in hong kong because we successfully operate on a self financing model without receiving any recurrent grants from the government and provide wide access to education
8790658 compared with the other institutions participating in jupas we offer more flexible modes of study and a choice of programmes which integrate both theory and practice
8790659 in the past we have always received positive feedback from students taking our courses
8790660 therefore we want to give more people the chance to benefit from a tertiary level education and the advantages it brings
8790661 it is important for students to understand their personal needs before choosing a programme and applying
8790662 we hope the talk will give insights about the issues involved in studying a full time course whether ouhk will suit them best and whether they have the aptitude and self discipline needed to tackle certain subjects secondary students may not be sure about these things and we want to provide the necessary advice and guidance
8790663 people want the government under the leadership of president mahinda rajapaksa to flush out the terrorists from their last remaining jungle hideouts in the wanni and bring freedom and democracy to the people in the north
8790664 encourages civilians to move out from the conflict zone to areas under government control which would enable it to provide them food water shelter and other essential services
8790665 these are the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time
8790666 the defence welcomes this acknowledgment by the prosecution that fully half of the charges involving half of the alleged victims could never be proven
8790667 and by the time the trial has concluded the remaining charges will either be dismissed or anand jon will be found not guilty
8790668 these charges can never be resubmitted during this trial and the defence would strenuously oppose any refilling of these charges in the future after anand jon has been totally acquitted of the remaining charges
8790669 it is best not to swat at the fly s starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8790670 this illustrates how rapidly the fly s brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8790671 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8790672 when it first notices an approaching threat a fly s body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting
8790673 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8790674 since his appointment as president he has never thought about the people of afghanistan rather he is bent upon appeasing his foreign masters
8790675 ive seen a kingdom the rulers backed by russia the mujahideen government and taliban but this man karzai is the weakest ruler
8790676 the most unpopular man is in power one who has never been seen at public places for the last five years he is living in his highly guarded palace how can he serve the nation
8790677 we have to see whether the us wants karzai to continue as he has completely failed to deliver according to the wishes of people of afghanistan and the alliance isaf
8790678 he is fast losing his friends and i am sure after president george bush steps down in january next year karzai will be completely left alone and will be dumped by the new us administration
8790679 the governments have done nothing for us neither the mujahdeen taliban nor president karzai we have no water no electricity and are living in a miserable condition
8790680 you cant imagine how we were living during the taliban era
8790681 i would say that nato should stay in my country until taliban forces are eliminated still we are living under threat it was a nightmare and if they again came to power i would prefer to kill myself rather than live under taliban
8790682 hijab should be my choice i like to cover my head and body according to islamic tradition but i dont want someone else to tell me to do so
8790683 as long as karzai or some other person appointed by the us is in power and the isaf troops are in afghanistan we will continue to develop
8790684 as a result of the governors decision to bow to political pressures and move forward with her hearing we have no choice but to file a temporary restraining order where we have requested that the judge halt the governors proceedings
8790685 our decision was based upon the serious questions we have with the process the governor has outlined
8790686 we have a copy of the request for relief but have not been formally served
8790687 they wont just go away theyre making every effort to save this embarrassing administration
8790688 this meeting was scheduled at the governors behest and this meeting was an attempt to reach a global resolution of the matter
8790689 the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad
8790690 that kilpatrick had viable defenses to the charges granholm responded that it didnt matter
8790691 the mere possibility of kilpatricks rights being violated in the future is not going to justify a judge getting involved
8790692 plead to a felony under advisement probation for five years
8790693 dont run for office during those five years and at the end of the five years the trial court under a plea arrangement could refuse to accept the plea case dismissed he has no record whatsoever and he gets on with his life
8790694 im comfortable with anything that kym worthy comes up with
8790695 it was apparent at this meeting that the governor did not presume kilpatricks innocence the governor and her staff had prepared a blackboard scenario in which his presumption of innocence was ignored and significantly undercut the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad
8790696 the level of proof required in support of kilpatricks removal is that the governor is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence of official misconduct this burden of proof is entirely vague and amorphous
8790697 allowing the governor to proceed would be in blatant violation of kilpatricks rights and moreover undermines the publics interest in its elected officials

8790714 we own 86 dunams of land but we can only farm the 20 dunams furthest from the border it is too dangerous for us to work on the rest of our land
8790715 yousef and i have lost more than 300 000 because we cant farm our land any more
8790716 we had almond olive and citrus trees and we exported fruit and vegetables to the west bank and jordan and to israel now we will be lucky to make 300 from selling the parsley
8790717 they fire warning shots into the air and we see drones and helicopters circling in the sky above us we do not feel safe here on our land
8790718 i had ten dunams of fruit trees just behind my house
8790719 but the israelis bulldozed them our land is fertile but we cannot farm here anymore
8790720 my family feels more personally secure in this area now that they the israelis are not shooting and invading our area every day
8790721 it is just 800 meters away and i could walk there in ten minutes but if anyone goes onto their land near the border they will be shot even now i havent been able to farm those 40 dunams for more than four years
8790722 maybe if you see them for a few minutes theyll leave
8790723 we had a son who attended harvard for one year he loved harvard he was happy here but about a year ago he was accidentally killed my husband and i would like to erect a memorial to him somewhere on campus
8790724 we cant put up a statue for every person who attended harvard and died if we did this place would look like a cemetery
8790725 we dont want to erect a statue we thought we would like to give a building to harvard
8790726 a building do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs we have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical buildings here at harvard
8790727 people will forget what you said people will forget what you did

8790729 john mccain is my friend but these times require more than a good soldier
8790730 in a way to avoid having to know the hard things
8790731 to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers and the emergence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front in the war on terror
8790732 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets
8790733 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point

8790739 at the tuesday morning meeting with committee staffers biden launches into a stream of consciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing before he finally admits the obvious im groping here then he hits on an idea america needs to show the arab world that were not bent on its destruction seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran biden declares he surveys the table with raised eyebrows a how do ya like that look on his face
8790740 the reality is that although theres been some mild security progress there is in fact no security in baghdad or anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence
8790741 i will insist on a firm beginning to withdraw the troops and i will insist on a target date to get american combat forces out
8790742 if we do not change course in iraq soon youre going to see two years from now helicopters hovering over our embassy in the green zone in baghdad with people hanging
8790743 my sense is that we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our enemies in a number areas of iraq we are in short a long way from the goal line but we do have the ball and we are driving down the field
8790744 i think were lucky to have the most recognisable and largest icon in all of sport playing ours

8790749 the army chief is undertaking a four day tour to the uk sep 1 4 to add impetus to the existing defence relationship between the two countries and broadbase it into a mutually beneficial partnership
8790750 the army chief will visit the royal school of artillery at larkhill defence academy at shrivenham land warfare centre in the salisbury plains edinburgh castle in scotland and national army museum

8790752 this exercise and training programme was not part of our annual plan this year but was scheduled following an invitation from the uk army troops as a reciprocal gesture
8790753 we played hard not very smart at times but we played hard
8790754 i thought our line play on the offensive side was really good we did everything we could and we sustained it somehow
8790755 the line was killing today we did it as an offense and we came together as a team
8790756 its tough thunderridge made less mistakes and ran the ball very effectively
8790757 its exactly what we thought the grizzlies are a very good football team we knew what we were going to get
8790758 it was good enough and we feel pretty good about it

8790820 according to the web site mayoclinic com tapeworms can measure up to 50 feet long
8790821 i didnt see 12 out there you should be just fine
8790822 we were able to do it on our first drive the last time we played them but this certainly wasnt a super bowl opening drive
8790823 i know that if you play a bad game in the preseason it doesnt matter because it doesnt go on your record
8790824 and if you play a great game that doesnt matter either because it doesnt go on your record
8790825 the preseason is a necessary evil but you want to just get through it healthy thats the most important thing in my eyes i mean there are teams that have gone 4 0 in the preseason and then theyre not even 500 in the regular season i dont look at record i look at how people play
8790826 thats a legit defense thats given me fits in the past and a lot of people some headaches
8790827 im definitely happy to get something positive out of it but they were vanilla theyre not going to show anything now not in the preseason
8790828 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8790829 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8790830 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8790831 it felt real good we were down we were trying to make a comeback
8790832 we put the second team offense in and we were pushing it up and down the field it was good to end with a touchdown
8790833 you never know whats going to happen in this situation especially with bill belichick
8790834 well see what happens tomorrow and the next few days
8790835 as a quarterback youd like to get a couple snaps in just to get a feel for being there and having a rush around you but its not that important
8790836 as long as hes getting major reps in practice with the starters hell be fine
8790837 we wanted to see matt cassel play and tom wouldnt have played much in this game anyway we wanted to see matt gutierrez and kevin oconnell play
8790838 we made the check chad made the catch and the line picked up the all out blitz
8790839 its pretty fun when it goes to plan like that
8790840 in tough times invest your trust in an articulate mesmerizing speaker who has your interests at heart more than john mccain whose party leadership has squandered it right to lead
8790841 the rigorous studies clearly show red light cameras dont work
8790842 instead they increase crashes and injuries as drivers attempt to abruptly stop at camera intersections
8790843 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists
8790844 if the people were ever to find out what we have done we would be chased down the streets and lynched
8790845 real courage is when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway
8790846 its our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
8790847 the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and thus clamorous to be led to safety by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins all of them imaginary
8790848 great e commerce site easy navigation and good response a lot of good products as well

8790852 youre going to need a super well polished shield a wicked sharp sword and a nice sized pair of cajones
8790853 to defend something is always to discredit it yes the person who defends that has never believed in it if he does believe then the enthusiasm of faith is not a defence no it is the assault and the victory a believer is a victor
8790854 thou shalt not extinguish thine anger but shall master it that thy conscience may not be blunted by adjustment to wrong causes
8790855 it is not only a threat to international security but a breach of it
8790856 the territory previously known in soviet times as south ossetia is completely cleansed of remnants of the georgian population
8790857 an additional factor that needs to be taken into account
8790858 man utd to face celtic in europe but liverpool draw toughest group
8790859 we decided it best to keep our team and student athletes out of potential harms way
8790860 we are disappointed but it is the right thing to do
8790861 neither offense was moving the ball very well at that point and it gave us momentum going into the half
8790862 i owe everything to my teammates and especially my linemen
8790863 we just tried to keep the same amount of intensity for the entire game and we got a big win
8790864 we were dominated in every possible way we couldve been tonight
8790865 we have athletes on this team but they have to learn to play the game better and we didnt play to our capability tonight
8790866 the reason we kept pooch kicking it was because we were scared of burton returning the ball for a big gain which he did the first time
8790867 so they didnt always look consistent with their pass and that takes your middle out of the game that was our goal because we know how good of a player she is
8790868 we made too many errors and we didnt really work as a team
8790869 were still working on that and will come out next game with a better mentality they were chipping over alex tanner and they were just killing us there
8790870 finally we moved our defense more and it started getting better but they obviously werent hitting toward me and focusing on hitting down the line more there was no way we could have stopped it because alex isnt the tallest person in the world
8790871 nikki is a great player for them so we tried to mix it up against them and running different things while trying to take different shots and we did that tonight going against them was nerve wracking but we got this win under our belt we know now we can close out in three against really good teams
8790872 i was nervous i got some sleep last night but i kept tossing and turning
8790873 this is probably the race that will decide the whole season ive got to do my best
8790874 i tend to go out too fast coach and i were trying to make sure that i was relaxed throughout so i could pick it up as i went but i guess i relaxed too much
8790875 im sure it wouldve helped having a track season being my senior year and all but i trained hard over the summer so it wasnt much of a factor
8790876 we just need to keep on working harder because we can get better
8790877 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8790881 this is a cbs news election 08 update in a new cbs poll voters were asked which nickname they preferred for the democratic ticket of obama biden
8790882 do everything in his power to protect israel from iran
8790883 watch obama describe how mccain doesnt care about working class
8790884 now i dont believe senator john mccain doesnt care about whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8790885 mccain doesnt care sen barack obama says sen john mccain doesnt care about struggling americans
8790886 dems just tax everyone and blow it on social programs
8790887 at this point we are still in the process of making a decision
8790888 were certainly paying close attention to the vice presidential choice expected later this week but were still ahead of schedule in terms of a final decision when you look at our endorsement decisions in 2000 1996 and 2004
8790889 were continuing to assess where we want to go but certainly sen mccain is no george bush when it comes to gay issues he has a more inclusive record than our current president and he is going to be able to get our party focused on the unifying core republican issues instead of using divisive social issues to win
8790890 oh nena no se que hacer soy inutil y no sirvo para nada me pagan para comer con mis compa eras secretarias y en realidad solo se organizar coperachas para el siguiente cumplea os que habr de la patty o de la martha
8790891 i have worked with akshay for eight years i really respect him for the way he has groomed himself he has become one of the biggest metrosexual stars most stylish fashion icon and he is so successful that i am proud of him just look from where he has come and where he has reached
8790892 i started designing for akshay in 1992 but i stopped working with him in 2000 because i had to move on also both of us needed to take a break from each other
8790893 i started 16 years back at that time the only opportunity i got was in bollywood i think it was good for me as it has created awareness about my brand i have met a lot of actors who want to wear clothes designed by me
8790894 the people i dress up are the best dressed they are really great with clothes they have a great body to carry off anything and they have a good style of their own
8790895 shilpa likes deeper and rich indian colours she likes to wear emerald she loves red and it really suits her even bipasha likes red katrina likes pastel and lighter shades
8790896 it is fun to work with actors and also challenging to make them look different every time it is also a challenge for them to get into a character every time with different clothes and looks a lot of hard work is required in bollywood
8790897 when i started fashion was not even taking off in a very big manner and i think it was after four to five years that i felt the need to do creative work for myself thats when i started doing clothes that were more wearable and saleable
8790898 i came at the right time for mainstream fashion luckily i have kept a very good balance between bollywood and mainstream fashion till now
8790899 at times you get so over stimulated and agitated by these voice that you often flip out
8790900 if you are asked about this matter your message should be it is now under investigation
8790901 you have to remember that the sources are often other inmates and theyre not the most reliable sources in the world
8790902 you need to have fairly cogent evidence before you lock down an institution otherwise youd be locking it down consistently the issue here though is what was the information how cogent was it and what steps did the staff take
8790903 you can talk about what a great player he is but his legacy in my mind and i think in the minds of anyone who was here when he was here is one of all those intrinsic values his capacity for hard work and doing things the right way
8790904 in his time at k state he was everything we want our student athletes to be
8790905 beating nebraska for the first time is definitely one of the things im most proud of there are a lot of things in my career im proud of the fiesta bowl tripwas great and my senior year we finished in the top 10 and won our bowl game against but if i had to pick one thing it would be beating we had had a lot of teams who had been competitive and knocking on the door against them and we were finally able to get it done
8790906 he was always open to coaching he did everything you asked him and more and he was just a great model for our other athletes
8790907 he worked as hard as anyone we ever had in our program
8790908 i didnt have any expectations as far as playing in the nfl
8790909 i wanted to get a scholarship to play football and i wanted to play at k state
8790910 hes an inspiration to our kids about what you can accomplish if youre willing to work hard at it
8790911 i have to step back and remember that some of the kids who play for us now werent even born yet when mark was here but we talk about him so much and use him as an example that they feel pretty close to him his example really motivates our kids
8790912 what im so proud of is the fact that hes managed to have a 10 year career in the nfl and has not changed as a person and thats a real tribute to who you are
8790913 the change in lifestyle from college to becoming a professional athlete is a big one
8790914 its crazy to think that this many years have passed since i was in school and they went really fast i played with a lot of great players and a lot of guys who really deserve this honor as well
8790915 i had a great time and i loved k state it was a great time to be there to play for coach snyder and im just glad that i got to be a part of it
8790916 a u s airstrike south of herat in western afghanistan has killed more than 50 innocent civilians including women and children
8790917 he who controls the present controls the past he who controls the past controls the future
8790918 i hate to be a cynic but it smacks of how do i get my tour opening night in the news during the democratic convention
8790919 if its against the law arrest me if you can handle it undress me
8790920 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refused to consider any smear or attack off limits
8790921 these comparisons are outrageous and offensive and have no place in the political process we hope that john mccain will offer a similar condemnation as his allies increasingly practice sleazy swift boat politics
8790922 dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men
8790923 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose and thats what we have to restore
8790924 and no we cant agree on the second amendment because yes gun advocates really do want everyone to be able to have ak 47s if theyre so inclined
8790925 this is what i believe and if you believe otherwise then you are going to hell
8790926 actually no we cant agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies because many of the no abortion advocates dont want birth control
8790927 this was a very impressive speech sure not everything he promised will happen less taxes no deficit pudding for all
8790928 i was against the war before it was cool to be against the war
8790929 uh uh uh hold on im trying to think uh uh uh
8790930 get this one iran is changing its cars to run on natural gas and were not doing a thing here theyre doing this to use less oil and sell it for a 120 a barrel we can switch our cars to natural gas and stop sending our dollars to foreign countries
8790931 between countries we have life expectancy differences of more than 40 years a woman in botswana can expect to live 43 years in japan 86 years
8790932 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
8790933 what makes this especially interesting is ford owns mazda which means anything mazda builds could appear in showrooms with a blue oval on the hood looks like the race is on
8790934 he raced at a time when racing was extremely dangerous and got through it all without a serious injury
8790935 he had an extraordinary mechanical sense he was very much in tune with the car
8790936 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari
8790937 phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much
8790938 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
8790939 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
8790940 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
8790941 things didnt happen the way we wanted but youve got to expect that out of any football game
8790942 especially when youre playing such a good opponent like miami
8790943 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
8790944 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays
8790945 it felt like we had a junior or senior out there playing quarterback
8790946 it would be hard to be a good coach if the guys didnt see that you loved them at some point
8790947 going against their first defense and being productive that was the highlight of my nfl career to date
8790948 a little bit but you always are in the preseason
8790949 every game is important if you take a day off the next day youll be gone
8790950 it doesnt make you uncomfortable it makes you want to work harder
8790951 hopefully ill get a phone call and go somewhere else this is a dream ive had since i was young im so close i dont want to give up yet
8790952 i dont think youll see the legalization of the recreational use of marijuana as a tax resource or whatever
8790953 what stops marijuana from being legalized for medicinal or recreational purposes
8790954 i have supported medicinal use of marijuana over and over again but there just isnt enough support for it we try to grow our numbers each year but were not there yet but we try each year to try to grow our number its a struggle we need peoples help to be in touch with their members of congress to say why this should be the case
8790955 el gobierno est abierto al di logo pero no bajo la irracionalidad de bloqueos propiciados por los prefectos y c vicos de la media luna
8790956 lo que buscan con estas acciones es el enfrentamiento pero nosotros no daremos lugar a esa provocaci n
8790957 es una decisi n hist rica para el pueblo boliviano porque se est poniendo en manos del pueblo boliviano una nueva constituci n pol tica del estado para refundar bolivia y terminar con la desigualdad y desconocimiento de los campesinos e ind genas originarios
8790958 el sector gremialista de todo el pa s va ha trabajar para que la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado sea aprobada porque reconoce al sector minorista las autonom as ind genas y departamentales y porque es inclusiva
8790959 lo aceptamos con agradecimiento con profunda humildad y con el compromiso irrenunciable de continuar con cada una de las medidas puestas en marchas y de las transformaciones estructurales que nuestro pa s est requiriendo
8790960 los importante es haber obtenido esta votaci n lo que se traduce en una preferencia de un pueblo que apuesta por un futuro mejor para los bolivianos
8790961 el objetivo es fortalecer las microempresas ligadas a cadenas productivas capaces de generar impresos mercados profesionales con altos niveles t cnicos y que esta actividad forma parte de la pol tica de dignificaci n laboral
8790962 vamos a venir con ellos para verificar d nde va a ser la sede del parlamento sudamericano y como siempre queremos el cari o el respeto de ustedes hermanas y hermanos porque estamos hablando de algo grande
8790963 antes que el conalcam el pueblo boliviano a trav s del referendo revocatorio le ha dado al hermano presidente de la rep blica evo morales ayma el mandato de aprobar la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado en democracia
8790964 esta es la primera vez que este seminario se realiza en bolivia esta es por lo tanto una ocasi n importante para la discusi n de medidas orientadas a la diversificaci n del comercio entre nuestros dos pa ses vecinos y socios en sudam rica
8790965 el compromiso recientemente asumido con bolivia y chile de crear una conexi n interoce nica entre el pac fico y el atl ntico seguramente incrementar a n m s el intercambio comercial con brasil hay campo para que crezcan las exportaciones bolivianas hay que aprovechar el momento
8790966 el comercio bilateral registra un incremento de casi el 95 por ciento de las exportaciones bolivianas hacia brasil en los primeros seis meses de este a o pero ese incremento puede ser a n m s grande
8790967 exigiremos a la fiscal a acelere la investigaci n a objeto de identificar a las personas que incurrieron en un acto ilegal y sorprendieron la buena fe del estado
8790968 es lamentable que los sectores pol ticos no est n haciendo un esfuerzo para lograr encontrar puentes que nos permitan tener un verdadero pacto social de unidad nacional que se exprese en una nueva constituci n
8790969 un autentico pacto de unidad y de integraci n entre los bolivianos
8790970 la ley 3837 se encuentra vigente la que se ala que la convocatoria al referendo dirimidor tiene que ser hecha por una ley de la rep blica y sancionada con una votaci n de dos tercios del congreso nacional
8790971 en la ley de descentralizaci n se establece un mecanismo distinto de designaci n y se tiene que entender que en bolivia se requiere un marco de legalidad no se lo puede hacer a costa del quebrantamiento del estado de derecho
8790972 hoy d a estamos concentrados para comunicarles oficialmente que esa normal de educaci n musical que ha sido cerrado durante los gobiernos neoliberales se est reabriendo ac en tarata
8790973 si queremos que haya un profesor de m sica m nimamente deber a de interpretar 20 instrumentos musicales entre quenas zampo as tarkas instrumentos de viento como trompetas tocar todos los instrumentos y escribir adem s de eso porque as mejoraremos la educaci n
8790974 ha empezado a mejorar la econom a nacional en todos los niveles
8790975 digo esto porque esta madre tierra tiene tantos recursos naturales pese al saqueo hist rico de 500 a os de 200 a os de la vida republicana de los ltimos 20 a os de neoliberalismo
8790976 esta totalmente sustentado respaldado y remachado legalmente para que este blindaje permita avanzar al 7 de diciembre y definir el destino del pa s
8790977 lo que ha hecho el presidente evo morales se funda en la legalidad y en la legitimidad y ambas convergen en este caso
8790978 estos aspectos dan pie al referendo nacional para definir y dirimir en este caso aprobar el nuevo texto constitucional por ambos lados entonces convergen la legalidad y la legitimidad
8790979 le dan la definitiva base legal y constitucional al decreto supremo no
8790980 eso es lo que se har con este decreto supremo
8790981 por eso este decreto hist rico el 29691 permite retornar a la fuente del soberano principio establecido en el pacto de san jos de costa rica y otorgarle al pueblo la capacidad de decidir si quiere una nueva constituci n pol tica del estado o no la quiere
8790982 el pueblo es el que va decidir no rganos obstruccionistas no grupos de hecho no los palos no patadas el pueblo decidir si quiere o no quiere esta nueva constituci n
8790983 intentar n seguramente utilizar cuanta argucia legal exista cuanta chicana sea posible realizar para evitar el pronunciamiento del pueblo
8790984 como ocurri el 10 de agosto de este a o
8790985 crea un efecto de empleo muy grande que bolivia lo necesita mucho
8790986 es una vitrina de promoci n y comercializaci n de ofertas de turismo cultural de aventura ecol gico hist rico para colegios
8790987 el turismo interno debe constituirse en uno de los mecanismos para la integraci n de bolivia la conformaci n de un pa s multicultural e intercultural
8790988 el presente decreto supremo tiene por objeto fijar la fecha del referendo nacional constituyente dirimitorio y aprobatorio convocado por ley no 3836 del 29 de febrero del 2008
8790989 estamos entrando a la recta final y aqu nueva constituci n se encuentra las demandas de todos los sectores sociales el sacrificio de todos los bolivianos
8790990 el nuevo modelo de estado es incluyente participativo nuestra nueva constituci n nos ofrece eso
8790991 qu triste es ver cuando el poder se encuentra en pocas manos y regiones eso lo est n demostrando aquellos que vivieron del pa s
8790992 en el primer semestre de 2006 se registraron 134 conflictos en el primer semestre de 2007 se registraron 139 conflictos y en el primer semestre de 2008 se dieron 144 conflictos que significa un aumento de los conflictos en esta gesti n
8790993 esa lucha hist rica por una refundaci n de bolivia tantas marchas aportes debates siento primera vez en la historia espero no equivocarme que el pueblo boliviano participa de la redacci n de una constituci n esta nueva carta magna ser sometida al voto del pueblo boliviano
8790994 estamos dando pasos importantes cambios importantes en democracia pero fundamentalmente con la participaci n del pueblo boliviano con su voto
8790995 ahora hay un desaf o de c mo con el voto del pueblo refundar bolivia y garantizar un estado plurinacional
8790996 ser una nueva experiencia ser una nueva vivencia la mejores lecciones son errores y ahora estamos planteando democratizar estas autoridades que tiene el estado boliviano
8790997 yo tengo mucha confianza en el poder del pueblo en esa conciencia del pueblo para ir resolviendo las diferencias que tienen ciertas autoridades
8790998 youre on your own and its time for them to own their failure
8790999 significant and perhaps major part in the uks energy mix over the next two decades
8791000 there will be environmental challenges but frankly its a political must to keep the lights on
8791001 to start from scratch to drive shafts would cost about 1bn and take eight or nine years even if you find the people who know how to drive shafts any more
8791002 the problem behind the incidents is a lack of investments iberdrola and endesa are spending less on maintenance and security
8791003 the fiction looks brilliantly varied but once again it seems to be non fiction that is particularly ambitious and unafraid of scaling the really big themes of history culture and society
8791004 i thought it was marvelous he laid out what he is going to do its not going to be easy but he is going to try
8791005 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8791006 he did a great job addressing the areas where he has been attacked patriotism his qualifications for the job and how he plans to pay for all his ideas
8791007 the over the top stadium show surrounding the speech might help motivate his supporters but it might be playing into the hands of his critics who try to paint him as a rock star with no substance
8791008 he described a chance to keep the american promise and he made a lot of promises he is the pied piper of promises
8791009 a government that is powerful enough to give you everything you want can take everything you have
8791010 he is scarier than former president bill clinton because he is arrogant and a true believer
8791011 it was a feel good speech it made you think about yourself and where you wanted the united states to go it was just him making you feel good for the purpose of him getting elected
8791012 there was great resonance with his criticism of the bush administration and mccains support for it
8791013 move in and circle around me we cant let them seize our stage too easily
8791014 we have told our union members to call a leave of absence to join the rally in bangkok to oust this government which has been damaging the country over the past seven months
8791015 in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8791016 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8791017 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8791018 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
8791019 john mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue the same policies over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8791020 on this the 45th anniversary of the march on washington and in honor of the legacies of my father and of bobby kennedy let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change we still need barack obama
8791021 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but were the ones who will pay for his flip flops
8791022 i knew i need a triple so as soon as i hit the ball im going to go to third
8791023 they were going all crazy and i was just thinking about boone a little bit
8791024 but as soon as he hit the ball everybody was go three go three go three all the way
8791025 i didnt know what was going on until everybody went to screaming
8791026 i was just trying to sit there and get some air or whatever and i look at the board because everybody was screaming in the dugout and i was like oh thats why so i went to screaming too
8791027 you get that two run lead in the first inning its kind of the last thing you want to do is give up runs especially that many
8791028 we have to go out there and win a ball game to start making us feel good right now it doesnt feel too good
8791029 it was just a great feeling in a season full of some not so happy memories
8791030 weve been playing well of late and its just good to see smiles on everyones face
8791031 it seemed to me that the clintons did what they needed to do
8791032 but it does also seem like the last two days were more about them than him
8791033 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8791034 they were able to make obama more acceptable and to restore some measure of party unity but they never defined john mccain in terms that will help them in the fall
8791035 i think mccain was able to thanks to the clintons successfully not be the pinata this week
8791036 sen mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear well not this year not this time
8791037 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because republican presidential candidate mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8791038 we love al gore we believe he was cheated in the 2000 election and that he would have been a great president
8791039 were proud that he keeps on serving this country and the world
8791040 mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8791041 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8791042 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
8791043 die milit rische auseinandersetzung im kaukasus ist neudeck zufolge ein beweis daf r dass zu sp t auf krisen reagiert werde der konflikt zeige wie verh ngnisvoll wir als b rger im aktualit tsterror verfangen sind sagte neudeck die pl ne zu diesem krieg seinen lange zeit absehbar gewesen georgien sei der beweis daf r dass russland noch nicht teil der demokratischen welt sei man kann sich aussuchen ob dieses vorgehen in der tradition der zaren in der tradition stalins oder putins steht erkl rte neudeck
8791044 the police are in a tough position if they bring in armor or anything like that to crash a gate its going to look like the september 2006 coup times three
8791045 the logical non violent solution would be simply to seal off the area and deny them any food and water
8791046 i think he is on everyones short list you never can tell my guess is mitt romney
8791047 sen obama this is truly a good day for america
8791048 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8791049 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8791050 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8791051 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8791052 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8791053 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8791054 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8791055 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of senator obama
8791056 the fact remains obama is still not ready to be president
8791057 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8791058 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8791059 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8791060 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change america needs
8791061 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8791062 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8791063 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8791064 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8791067 people are really afraid to be free because they think someone might mistake being eclectic for being hodgepodge or mismatched
8791068 its important to have a direction and not just purchase aimlessly
8791069 chinas plans indicate its key role in new nuclear build and the impact of just a small element of its projects being realised would have major implications for new nuclear build capacity and the many constraints
8791070 over the next 20 to 30 years we are going to see a major ramp up in nuclear build
8791071 as more and more countries seek to insulate themselves against future energy price rises and the irrefutable reality of climate change theyre competing hard to enable their own nuclear programmes
8791072 the uk government has the ambition and commitment to build and maintain the best market in the world for companies to do business in nuclear power
8791073 the uk must aim to become the worlds number one location for new nuclear investment
8791074 we are not putting all our eggs into one basket
8791075 there is genuine concern about the difficulties people will face paying heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8791076 the poorest families now face an urgent situation the voluntary approach is failing and government and the energy companies need a plan of action within weeks
8791077 this letter really emphasised it and we said thats it
8791078 it doesnt sound like much but it all adds up
8791079 thats the little ways people are saving pennies at the moment
8791080 once the ground has been declared non organic you shouldnt go back to it
8791081 wants to impose wide ranging even draconian restrictions on former diplomats to prevent them from discussing anything that draws on their experience in the diplomatic service
8791082 freedom of information means it is not up to the government to decide what information is made public and what stays private
8791083 thats what we were laughing about two in a row whoo
8791084 i was just kind of looking in one zone for a pitch to hit
8791085 you always want to be in that spot to be able to drive in the winning run any time you can get a hit like that its fun
8791086 weve been through some tough times the last month and a half we didnt play well or swing the bat well thats part of it tonight we got some big hits thats contagious when everybody is struggling at the same time thats contagious too
8791087 i know hes always going to give me a good at bat and thats all you can ask for when a guy comes off the bench cold
8791088 hes had success this year and confidence grows from that
8791089 were on a long road trip and weve been battling things a lot ourselves so were just trying to figure out how to do a little better job on the road trip
8791090 we know what happens here with us and the as its always a battle its always good baseball two teams that play the game the right way hustle bust their tails
8791091 im not so sure youd want to see me eat it might not make a great first impression
8791092 carrie needs someone who is going to stick by her
8791093 im not complaining about this because of my record 4 14
8791094 but i know that would save our pitchers 20 home runs a year and at least 30 runs how many line drives barely clear that wall in right and how many balls barely clear the center field wall and drop into that grass i know ive given up a few
8791095 if i hadnt shaded it with my glove it would have hit me in the face
8791096 at the times we play its one of the most difficult parks with the sun right there in the fifth and sixth inning
8791097 sometimes we practice it and try to get behind the ball and get to the side where we can see it coming out of the sun
8791098 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
8791099 a hombres y mujeres que est bamos marchando nos han golpeado con piedras y ladrillos son gente de la prefectura y de la uni n juvenil tarije a estamos muy preocupados por las agresiones hay muchos heridos ya no queremos m s violencia
8791100 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
8791101 estos materiales no pueden ser siquiera utilizados bajo el argumento de material antimotines
8791102 hemos convocado a la prensa para hacer una denuncia de contrabando que atenta a la seguridad del estado estos materiales son de guerra son cascos de guerra ni siquiera podemos comparar con un material que puede ser utilizado como material antimotines
8791103 ninguna instituci n municipal ni civil pueden armar su propia fuerza paramilitar o policial eso es atentar contra la seguridad del estado
8791104 se pretend a enga ar la fe del estado al manifestar que se trataba de material para motociclistas y l minas de policarbonato pero se descubri que eran equipos b licos
8791105 las placas o escudos son los que utiliza la polic a militar y la polic a nacional para brindar seguridad a la comunidad adem s de ser utilizada para su propia protecci n personal
8791106 siete misiones de observaci n internacional han dado fe de la integridad de esta proceso y que reconocen avanzar en una serie de tema e incidentes que todav a permanecen en la participaci n electoral
8791107 when groups of people come together for events they can generate a tremendous amount of waste mainly from disposable utensils and plates food waste and beverage containers
8791108 in 2005 1 9 million tons of paper and plastic cups plates and food service products were thrown away in the u s thats 3 8 billion pounds of disposable food service products and packaging filling our landfills much of it from special events
8791109 a key factor to hosting a zero waste event is composting the food waste and compostable products after the event
8791110 im a firm believer that the greenest product is frequently the one you dont buy
8791111 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year
8791112 i just havent been scoring the way i would like even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week
8791113 it was a fun tournament last year and i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament
8791114 but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8791115 id be making half as much as i am now
8791116 im very thankful hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game
8791117 you know that right you are playing left handed this week arent you
8791118 the key is going to be again scoring getting up and down around the greens that i miss and getting those birdie putts to drop
8791119 shes in talks to have a guest spot on one of their high profile shows
8791120 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
8791121 chris smelley did come in and play very well well have to wsatch the tape analyze it to see what in the world happened to tommy
8791122 i went out there and gave it everything i had
8791123 id like to play next week its the thing ive been working for well see how it goes
8791124 basically a tough start the game was fine until the last series we fumbled the ball at the half the first series of the second half we let it gete away from us
8791125 i thought we played ok its not time to start breaking out the champagne or anything
8791126 i kept watching hale he always seems to be there when im around
8791127 usually he irwin ends up winning most of the time so that was the difference he won a lot more than i did in those situations when we were neck and neck
8791128 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8791129 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8791130 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8791131 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8791132 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8791133 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8791134 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8791135 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8791136 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8791137 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8791138 its a big step to actually put it out there
8791139 i remember what roberto de vicenzo once said to me
8791140 if you shoot under 70 everybody will understand you if you dont they wont want to talk to you anyway
8791141 im not complaining about this because of my record 4 14
8791142 but i know that would save our pitchers 20 home runs a year and at least 30 runs how many line drives barely clear that wall in right and how many balls barely clear the center field wall and drop into that grass i know ive given up a few
8791143 if i hadnt shaded it with my glove it would have hit me in the face
8791144 at the times we play its one of the most difficult parks with the sun right there in the fifth and sixth inning
8791145 sometimes we practice it and try to get behind the ball and get to the side where we can see it coming out of the sun
8791146 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8791147 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8791148 to still be in fresno at this juncture of the season is a bit shocking
8791149 i understand this is a transition year and maybe that transition does not involve me
8791150 its who we think going into next year is going to have a chance to help us
8791151 you want a smaller pool of guys because there is only going to be so much playing time within that pool you want an ample amount of time to evaluate them
8791152 just because somebody was in the big leagues or somebody has been here earlier in the year they wont have a free pass to get back up here
8791153 i feel that we all believe we can contribute at the major league level
8791154 weve proven it in previous seasons to sit and dwell on our misfortunes is not going to help us get back to that level
8791155 it cant be easy being in that situation passed up by some other guys and having to wait it out and see what happens in september
8791156 and im not going to sit and play gm im grateful to have had the opportunities that i have had and i believe that ive made the most of them all i can honestly say is that i would love to have the opportunity to play in the major leagues with any team that is willing to allow me that chance whether its the san francisco giants i cant say
8791157 hes been able to command his pitches in lower half of the strike zone better hes commanded his sinker and slider and used his curveball in the right counts it was just a matter of getting his strength and velocity up the key for him was getting back to healthy and trusting his stuff
8791158 im seeing better velocity on his fastball hes using it more i like the way hes pitching hes avoided throwing his breaking ball on all counts and hes using it as a put away pitch instead of trying to get ahead with it his velocity is back up to 93 or 94
8791159 its just consistency at the plate his knowledge of the strike zone has improved a lot hes putting better swings on the baseball just quality at bats thats what were looking for hes driven the ball a lot better this year than last year
8791160 fop just tore up his knee in albuquerque two weeks ago and hes out for the year he had surgery for an acl tear he was making progress he was getting his confidence back and we put him in the rotation for a couple of starts hopefully he continues after he comes back and we see what happens
8791161 my legs are the no 1 priority on my body
8791162 thats how i do basically everything i need to do my success comes from legs
8791163 without a doubt you cant just arm tackle you have to make some hard hits on that guy
8791164 hes a guy who has great balance and vision and is tough
8791165 hell run between the tackles and you better make sure you wrap him up or hell bounce out of there and make some big plays
8791166 of course i pride myself on never letting the first guy bring me down
8791167 were playing a downhill physical football team we better be ready for it
8791168 at the end of last year we let ourselves down but stopping the run and playing smash mouth football is our pride
8791169 i just put myself in their coachs shoes and all hes heard about is our 3 4 defense
8791170 id be ready to test our run defense and see if we can hold up
8791171 i think thats part of the reason why im not being successful
8791172 when i was in the minors i always started like 100 and everybody was really worried about me but ive always trusted in my tools and i know that i can do it
8791173 but you dont ever make promises in this business you just go down you do your best you get your swing back and you earn your way back up
8791174 something thats deep in the left field corner a cameraman from a certain angle might be more inclined to focus on the player well now he might be a little bit wider and keep an eye on the tip of the fence
8791175 because we know what were doing the camera guys know what theyre doing its up to major league baseball to take it from there
8791176 restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8791177 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8791178 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8791179 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8791180 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8791181 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8791182 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8791183 enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century to keep the american promise alive
8791184 its not that john mccain doesnt care its that he doesnt get it
8791185 i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
8791186 we can disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8791187 its no surprise to learn that the mets t shirt originated as a washington post cartoon
8791188 i get to run out on an nfl field in front of my family and everyone im just going to live it up and see what happens
8791189 i dont have the luxury of sitting back with my shoulder pads off
8791190 college was the last time i really got to play the whole game
8791191 ive been thinking to myself ive had a good camp yeah but its not over i want to prove to myself that i can be a viable receiver on this team
8791192 some guys will make it or break it in that game
8791193 but for the most part you know your team right now
8791194 i think some teams that are really deep right now there is value to this game for them because theyve got a number of guys theyre thinking can make the roster hopefully well be there some day
8791195 are and do not care for them very much im looking for opinions on what to get i want these opinions based on challenge game play missions and quests storyline and the fun experience of the different characters i dont mind the

8791207 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same
8791208 we create the threats why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its a fact that were over there that we create these crises
8791209 ive endorsed neither one and we will not endorse either the two top candidates

8791216 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8791217 even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings
8791218 we arrived at 9am more than three hours before our flight and waited for 45 minutes then we were told that the flight had been delayed due to technical problems
8791219 we were told to check back and some people left the airport but we have been waiting here as we had nowhere to go and had limited currency weve just found out whats happened and my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand
8791220 from here we believe that the company has the opportunity to address its cost base more aggressively
8791221 the references to difficult trading conditions encouraged the market generally to write down its forecasts for the company
8791222 it may seem madness to stay on buy given current sector news flow but we think the yield provides a solid underpinning and believe the medium term upside when a recovery in transaction volumes occurs could be very material
8791223 we can see far better returns in larger more liquid stocks such as hbos
8791224 people have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power

8791230 we expect that the current price correction in the used car market has some way to go although we anticipate that it will have run its course by the end of the year
8791231 these market conditions are causing volume and margin pressure in addition like most other companies in the uk we have been affected by rising costs which we have already taken action to mitigate

8791400 ive never felt this way about anyone in my life
8791401 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8791402 all hok offices besides us basically operate as a general practice we operate as a specialty and that has been a good business model for us
8791403 like many businesses across the country we continue to feel the economic challenges including consecutive newsprint increases over the past 13 months
8791404 continue to provide quality products and services for our audience which continues to grow in print and online
8791405 is clearly a transforming event in the history of our company
8791406 we have been very impressed with evogenes discovery capabilities particularly their computer based predictive biology efforts

8791410 our universities and culture are the envy of the world
8791411 at this point the future is so cloudy in terms of the development of the market when its going to pick up again
8791412 then i see a very good opportunity that basically i would hope that everything could be break even to profitable
8791413 we would hope to have the corporation profitable again by then
8791414 we are selling every hhr and cobalt we can make with either minimal or zero incentives whereas three years ago even the hhr you had to put 3 000 bucks on it to move it so i think in practice the price of small cars has gone up three or four thousand dollars
8791415 there may be a post olympic slump but i would argue that it is one that has been under way for some time
8791416 clearly chinas growth rate could go lower if the global economy goes into the kind of slump people are talking about
8791417 its not the level but the change the worst fear of chinese leadership is social unrest
8791418 in a way this olympics was a revelation to people
8791419 theres still a largely shared view of people working in sweatshops that its just another third world country
8791420 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8791421 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8791422 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8791423 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8791424 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8791425 each party negotiating this has its own views about its own standards being better
8791426 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8791427 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8791428 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of example than by the example of our power

8791430 all i can say after last weeks selection is that when youre right 52 per cent of the time youre wrong 48 per cent of the time stick with me punters
8791431 i dont care about the first two games this one hurt
8791432 we played our hearts out we lost a really tough game
8791433 thats the way to go the same way with the lineup we put guys in and out and right now you have to mix and match and go with the hot hand
8791434 i like to throw and ive thrown a lot of times and i made one
8791435 brad said you throw 100 times and get one thats good
8791436 we have a good idea what were going to do but were going to hold off
8791437 any moves we make unless something happens health wise the guys wouldnt report until the second tuesday
8791438 theyre still doing the same stuff theyre playing consistent and getting pitching theyve got a pretty good offense themselves
8791439 you credit manager theyve been able to continue i give them a lot of credit for taking relievers and making them starters
8791440 you credit manager theyve been able to continue i give them a lot of credit for taking relievers and making them starters
8791441 i think thats one of the things were supposed to do
8791442 thats what were here for theres no way coming into the clubhouse is going to change the situation any but if you can do a little something even for a small period of time to make him feel good it is certainly something we ought to be participating in
8791443 i want to go out and compete and at the end of the year everything works itself out
8791444 im throwing the ball well but theres been a lot of games this year i thought i threw the ball well and came up empty obviously the last two games ive thrown the ball pretty good and kept them off balance
8791445 these last two starts have really been terrific and im hoping thats the real brandon backe we see
8791446 he did the same thing here last time out and attacked the zone with his fastball and went to his off speed stuff when he needed to he was really good
8791447 im looking at eight innings or a complete game going into the seventh inning
8791448 im not trying to get ahead of myself but its certainly possible to get two outs and have all the stuff happen a ball that goes halfway to third and i would have had to have made a great play it starts from there
8791449 they had a triple that gets in the nook of the crawford boxes and i walk a guy adam rosales who hasnt established himself in the league and here you go im more frustrated i didnt last longer than 62 3
8791450 if there is a difference its early on in the season i felt good and i busted up my thumb and it took a little bit to get my timing going since the middle to end of may thats when i started feeling comfortable at the plate
8791451 hi my name is heather and im a football holic

8791461 our calendars where we are supposed to go the addresses
8791462 and its like we are kind of stuck at the moment
8791463 they came with a knife its mind boggling to think something like this could happen
8791464 it was terrible for us because they are black and we are black and so they are like stealing from their own brothers and sisters
8791465 i wont say its always educated conversation but theres definitely a lot of conversation
8791466 its good to know about the guys you like and the guys you dont like
8791467 i think its important to be informed our most democratic right is to be informed hear different opinions and cast our vote on those
8791468 if we analyze the speeches here then they go history class where they discuss how its affecting history they are more prepared and they are more prepared as citizens
8791469 if im going to keep up with this trend i have to know what im talking about right
8791470 we havent worked hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through four more years of failed leadership
8791471 i tried to throw strikes make my pitch tried to get a good situation see how my pitching responds good changeup good breaking pitch i was pretty happy about all that
8791472 they wanted me to come here to face more experience so i proved to them i can pitch right now
8791473 if they give me a chance yeah i have to pitch every five days we finish here monday so i probably wont pitch any more for the mud hens i dont know what they want to do maybe go to florida and pitch to hitters in instructional league i dont know
8791474 to me you just look not so much as the success but the swings against him there werent many good swings tonight against him
8791475 fans who had purchased tickets in rotterdam and oberhausen were very disappointed as the tour was called off at the last minute but we could do nothing about it we arrived at the decision to call off the tour after weighing the pros and cons of every possible solution the local promoters defaulted at the last minute making it impossible for us to continue with the shows
8791476 the official take is that local promoters defaulted and did not meet the requirements of wizcraft and stars on the tour however one of the main reasons for calling off the tour is mediocre ticket sales the tickets are very expensive and the meet and greet with the stars comes at an additional price also as compared to the unforgettable tour the tickets of srks temptations shows were much cheaper considering another temptations tour being in the offing in europe including germany bollywood fans were in no mood to buy expensive tickets for the unforgettable tour
8791477 the promoters of the show have defaulted on the contract im not authorised to give a comment on this and ticket price is not an issue all our other nine shows in canada trinidad and in entire usa and london were sold out
8791478 considering the fact that we are planning to have our segment of the show in europe we had an afterthought about doing the shows now in rotterdam and oberhausen we have now scheduled shows in the said european cities for our second segment in europe

8791491 ho da poco sentito il presidente saakashvili mi ha detto che la situazione difficile senza giri di parole ma tutto il paese con lui il momento in cui bisogna stare uniti io parlo ogni giorno con i miei genitori e con i miei amici e so che a tbilisi il clima ancora teso non certo per colpa dei georgiani molte cose non si sanno in occidente ed bene che vengano alla luce
8791492 sono laureato in storia della georgia e vedo molte analogie con il passato regime sovietico i russi stanno facendo quello che ha gi fatto con noi nel 21 e che lurss ha ripetuto nel 68 in cecoslovacchia e nell86 in polonia e succedendo ora il rischio grosso non riguarda solo noi e loro ma si pu estendere a unarea molto pi ampia
8791493 la premessa che loro dopo lindipendenza della georgia nel 91 secondo i trattati dovevano diventare una forza militare di pace nelle zone di frontiera e invece per anni hanno fatto tuttaltro di notte bombardavano e uccidevano stata una vera pulizia etnica e le aggressioni ai georgiani si sono intensificate non a caso prima dell8 agosto
8791494 non sparano pi ma c un grande nervosismo a tbilisi ed comprensibile il porto di poti sul mar nero che ci collega alloccidente stato minato la nostra marina militare stata distrutta i soldati russi hanno saccheggiato quello che potevano rubato i computer preso le uniformi dei nostri soldati le foto e i video lo dimostrano certe scene di violenza sono state raccapriccianti i russi non vogliono una situazione politicamente stabile in georgia hanno paura del nostro ingresso nella ue e nella nato cos ci sono 140 mila profughi donne bambini che vagano senza pi un tetto gori una citt distrutta
8791495 no ma lo sport pu aiutare soprattutto a tenere viva lattenzione sul problema le nostre sei medaglie a pechino hanno avuto questo grande merito in un primo momento gli atleti dellolimpiade dopo l8 agosto volevano tornare a casa le comunicazioni erano difficili e lassenza di notizie era angosciante poi sono rimasti in cina e le tre medaglie doro e le tre di bronzo sono state fondamentali perch il mondo continuasse a parlare di gori ora tocca a noi calciatori della nazionale di cui io sono il capitano
8791496 il 6 settembre affronteremo lirlanda per le qualificazioni al mondiale 2010 prima di sfidare litalia a udine il 10 settembre avremmo dovuto giocare a tbilisi nel nostro stadio da 80 posti e sarebbe stato importante per il paese putroppo la fifa non ha voluto andremo in campo neutro in germania a karlsruhe non giusto ma non ci lasceremo scappare loccasione noi calciatori della nazionale studieremo qualcosa per non fare dimenticare quello che sta succedendo
8791497 non cos noi difendiamo semplicemente il nostro territorio al quale storicamente appartengono labkhazia che la nostra costa azzurra e lossezia del sud che montuosa ma altrettanto affascinante anche se siamo solo cinque milioni e anche se il nostro un piccolo paese siamo orgogliosi e non ci inginocchiamo davanti a nessuno per grande che sia
8791498 no i delinquenti sono in tutto il mondo in georgia sono nato e cresciuto ci vivono mio padre carlo e mia madre medea scappare sarebbe assurdo io voglio che le cose migliorino e gi sono migliorate parecchio quando mio fratello stato rapito la corruzione imperava oggi diverso e infatti tutti e quattro quei criminali sono stati arrestati e condannati a 25 anni di carcere
8791499 its not that john mccain doesnt care he just doesnt get it
8791500 its history the spectacle is what dominates at the moment the speech was more prose than poetry i dont think he really played to the emotions of the crowd
8791501 the spectacle of sight and sound and pyrotechnics they were subjected to
8791502 published in the wall street journal that obama and lincoln were both
8791503 stevie wonder and the msnbc panel dance back up band and the blues brother pat buchanan
8791504 john mccain pays hundreds of dollars for his shoes but were the ones whore going pay for his flip flops
8791505 mccain is giving out free tickets to fill a ten thousand seat stadium
8791506 i realize im not the likeliest candidate for this office this election isnt about me its about you
8791507 patriotism has no party john mcain says hell folow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8791508 now click on the frogs at the top of your blog and make them croak
8791509 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8791510 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8791511 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8791512 the oxygen bottle went from the base of the aircraft to the ceiling of the first floor cabin
8791513 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8791514 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8791515 a loud bang was heard by passengers and crew followed by the rapid depressurisation of the cabin
8791516 we will continue to assist the atsb to ensure that factors that may have contributed to the incident are understood and that any ultimately identified are implemented
8791517 per la moglie di wenders ho fatto uneccezione perch vorrei occuparmi della chioma del marito
8791518 the beast promised itself to me white to grey and now almost black i want her on my side in the war
8791519 your war means nothing to me your war and jesus war is nothing more than keeping my children busy while your father and i play
8791520 when we stop playing i swallow the father and all our children i sleep until we are ready to play again
8791521 mother why do you take such interest in the beast
8791522 the beast is me it is the closest being to me in all creation see how it gets so caught up in its emotion in its blood in its lives but also see how none of it touches its core it likes to be human act human play human games but within nothing changes you can turn it black jesus can turn it white really it only remains grey it is me its core is me yet it has an entity it has a will and it exercises it as i have always exercised mine with abandon
8791523 are there any point to my games at all then
8791524 i have already answered your question and my own has been answered
8791525 we have some hills we have some turns and that should make it interesting
8791526 we went and looked for hills because typically when we race in saskatchewan we get all these flat chunks of highway so we intentionally put it out in the hills and theres one thats five kilometres from the bottom to the top
8791527 the elite group theres usually about 20 guys riding in that category
8791528 they dont drop many guys they stay together throughout that race because theyre all pretty strong but in the hills that makes it that much tougher to stay together
8791529 itll reward a smaller guy whos maybe a good climber instead of a big power guy whos really good on the flats
8791530 it might reward some different racers than those who always win the flat races
8791531 typically in saskatchewan we have a section of highway where we ride west turn around and go east and then back west
8791532 the wind is always consistent in those cases so this race should be more interesting
8791533 if i would have had a couple of days like that i would have been right in there
8791534 it was a good day im disappointed with my tee shot on 17 but other than that i cant say i didnt play well i played like i can play
8791535 it was a much better start and when i can do that and get a couple putts in the hole right away it makes a difference
8791536 it was great to be able to get up there
8791537 i was happy with my round and it makes me a lot happier to be going home with this as opposed to another 84
8791538 right now im just concentrating on getting all our shuttles set up we have a lot of athletes coming in friday so we just want to make sure they all get in
8791539 and then its the last minute details for the weekend also working with our team and making sure everyone has their uniforms and ready to go
8791540 but its coming together pretty good im not too stressed yet
8791541 b c is sending a huge team because they have worlds right in their back yard
8791542 as far as ontario thats pretty much who were picking up all day friday them and quebec
8791543 there are going to be a lot of people coming in and there are going to be some pretty good pullers too a lot of national and world champions every class is going to be tough
8791544 george is 60 years old and hes been the canadian champion in his weight class for like 10 years
8791545 hes thirty years older than a lot of the younger guys and he can still beat them
8791546 at my tee time i was hitting into oblivion off the first tee and they didnt call it
8791547 it was nothing but white after 10 yards so we had no idea where we were hitting it was all by feel and on a golf course we dont know really well that isnt going to work very often
8791548 i didnt even get the worst of it my teammate who was hitting before me she lost a ball on her second shot when she thought she was shooting at the green
8791549 to say the least it was a bad start and i was a little upset
8791550 if i would have known that was going to happen and that i didnt have to tee off in those conditions if i didnt want to without being disqualified i would have definitely refused
8791551 i could have said i refuse to tee off but i didnt know that
8791552 i was just livid at that point and i just couldnt settle down
8791553 thats hard to let go youre at a canadian event and youre shooting into oblivion it just bothered me so much and that was my whole front nine
8791554 i was able to turn things around on the back nine but for the most part i was seeing red the whole way around
8791555 its just going to be let loose and go for it
8791556 play golf like you know you can its tough to be out of it right now but im still having fun and enjoying it
8791557 all i can do is go out there and do my best my goal was to get into the top 20 and i think i can do this im going to try and thats all i can do
8791558 weve always had lots of kids theyve worked their way up some of our open pullers for nationals first went to nationals as youths
8791559 this ones got a strong upper body so i thought it might be something she would enjoy
8791560 we dont make it in for every practice but kayne is a good coach and he shows us some technical things we practice on our own at home
8791561 its easy to practice and its a low cost sport
8791562 kaidens been doing it since he was three he went to his first national when he was 3 1 2 and he finished fourth now annae is getting interested in it
8791563 if theyre big enough and strong enough we encourage them to do both
8791564 i hope the city comes out and gets behind it

8791593 al lami was a moderate official and we are surprised by his arrest
8791594 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighboring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq
8791595 fighting and confronting saddams regime despite the risks that surrounded him
8791596 the americans know very well that such people were brought up and trained in iranian intelligence system
8791597 the detention of al lami is part of a chain of events that will lead to the uncovering of others

8791627 it wont make much of a difference to struggling american families who john mccain chooses to be the next dick cheney if he continues to insist on being the next george bush

8791632 uranium mining is extremely hazardous to human health and scarce water resources it creates an eternal pollution legacy for future generations of australians to deal with
8791633 beverley is in the driest state in the driest continent on earth south australia cant afford to give up the water that the beverley mine will pollute what south australia has in abundance is sunshine solar thermal electricity is what south australia should be exporting not yellowcake
8791634 this massive increase in the size of the beverley borefields from 16 square kilometres to more than 100 square kilometres radically expands the impact area into which hundreds of millions of litres of liquid radioactive waste is being discharged
8791635 it beggars belief that an environment minister would describe 90 million litres of liquid radioactive and acidic mine waste being discharged into groundwater in one year as worlds best practice
8791636 peter garrett may have decided to swallow a bitter pill to gain his ministry but he shouldnt expect the public to swallow the idea that what is going on at beverley is worlds best practice
8791637 in fact pumping millions of litres of strongly acid or alkaline solution into the ground water to strip uranium from the host rock is something most australians would be horrified
8791638 the environment ministers use of powers under the environment protection and biodiversity conservation epbc act 1999 to expand this uranium mine provides yet more urgency to the senate inquiry into the effectiveness and operations of the act currently underway i look forward to the senate inquiry recommending a thorough overhaul of this act which has failed australians again by enabling this decision
8791639 as you know im a believer and ive never pretended not to be and i respect those who have no religious belief its a free country
8791640 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8791641 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8791642 if you were simply reducing that to mathematically probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8791643 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8791644 if we properly compute based on our actual knowledge rather than speculation the probability for the universes existing with human life the result is unity

8791665 as legislative leaders we are more than willing to assist with any additional funding necessary to carry out the law
8791666 creating a patchwork of confusing and disparate directives opens the door to disenfranchise voters and does not allow every qualified voter equal opportunity to a ballot

8791678 i wonder how it would affect sales and piracy if the companies change the way they interact with their fans players community remembering back to the launch
8791679 piracy doesnt drive drive hardware prices up for the reason that those who manufacture games for pc are not manufacturing pcs with consoles

8791681 hi all for years ive been interested in programming games etc and im a whiz on the computer and know the basics of creating websites but
8791682 yeah i think juusos point is not that hes angry over the purchase he just wants to give some new examples of how you can market your stuff or
8791683 so some consoles are cheap because they are counting on licensing deals and software sales to make up the price right does this mean that piracy might

8791704 cindy i refuse to take out the garbage i lived in garbage for 51 2 years

8791706 one of the things ive never tried to do is exploit my vietnam service to my country because it would be totally inappropriate to do so
8791707 it has a five year half life and it is a powerful neurotoxin

8791709 that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
8791710 has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
8791711 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman
8791712 as a christian for me as a christian its also a sacred union
8791713 equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws

8791738 not knowing everything was what saved us if you know now what you what you will know someday you will not do this theres no question about it because its too hard theres too much to know you have to know so many things to make everything come together there are too many infinite number of details in order to be successful not to mention a lot of serendipity so if you know now what it will take you to be successful you wouldnt do it because the odds are just impossible my ignorance protected me from being overwhelmed by what you guys entrepreneurs are up to
8791739 we learn something of our recent experience with ati in that to make sure we understand the competition nvidias market share in the high end is probably something in the likes of 97 so in order for us to grow we have to grow the tam total available market but if youre a competitor you dont need to grow the tam you just have to grow into that 97 so heres a perfect example where 2 companies ati and nvidia have built the same products but have radically different strategies our focus is growing the tam notice nvision there ati strategy is taking my share notice dont focus on the tam focus on building the fastest little widget at the lowest possible price we have to make sure we simulate our competitors knowing our competitors is not enough that analysis process is something we really need to internalise and do much much better at the scale of business that we have today all it takes is one chip to disrupt 100 million chips we have in the marketplace

8791742 first of all we dont know what larabee is it has to ship i never competed against a powerpoint deck for this long so lets ask ourselves why that is the case imagine youre a start up company and you have a great idea this is going to be a killer its going to be the best thing in the world its going to change everything and im going to tell my competitors right away is there something wrong with that what would you do that well because the competitors are already there weve already built larabee its call cuda its not x86 binary compatible but neither is larabee when youll put larabee on your pc do you think itll boot windows i dont think so can you run word no so what can you do with it write a c program and compile to it just like cuda they intel know that weve built larabee 2 years ago they know that we have 100 million larabees in the world today and they know that by the time they show up there will be 200 million larabees in the world and if the case they have a talk about larabee and they have to talk about it as often as they can
8791743 i think its fabulous because its going to make the gpu market bigger gpus are not only for graphics when you have another player comes in the market place and talks about the general purpose nature of this processor and start highlighting design wins that are very general purpose in nature its going to expand peoples understanding and its going to eliminate this barrier of oh gpus are only for graphics its going to open up the field incredibly
8791744 transmeta innovated in 2 areas that are very important one area is low power technology and building processors that are low power and its not that we cant reinvent it all but we have to be respectful to the intellectual properties of other companies who have invented it and so were using a lot of very similar techniques as they have invented over the years as we built more and more processors that needs to be low power the second is that they created a dynamic translation software that frankly most processors someday will use cuda is dynamic translation we have an instruction set that is general purpose but that instruction set is a little different inside the chip and so hardware instruction set is changing all the time but the instruction set that is presented to the user never changes that technology is something that weve using for several years and again these are kind of grounds that transmeta has walked through before

8791789 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
8791790 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a love affair with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports

8791795 some people take the class because theyre looking for something fun to do on a saturday and some people have decided to start cooking more at home because of the slow economy and they want to improve their cooking skills
8791796 by the time they leave theyre in awe of the skill and technique involved in making great bbq
8791797 and this awe has transformed many of backyard bashs students into barbecue hobbyists
8791798 there have been several classes where weve had people enroll who ive been seeing on the competition circuit for years
8791799 we also have people who have never smoked anything before in their lives and the great thing is they keep coming back for more classes and advice
8791800 but were spreading the word of bbq and often creating more in store sales its definitely worth it when you know youre getting people excited about barbecue
8791801 the last time we had a class we had a guy in who smelled the barbecue from the intersection of highway 9 and nw 64th street he followed his nose to the store and inquired about signing up for classes
8791802 i see that ron paul is endeavoring to let you off the hook once again for my past criticisms of him here he provides plenty of evidence that he is even further around the bend than steve greens article in the january february issue of the new individualist said
8791803 how would you handle these global threats then if its not to send our troops there and make sure that were protected
8791804 why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its the fact that were over there that we create these crises
8791805 it is a good sign that we are getting there
8791806 i look forward to the day where we are like bowling green who has like 18 seniors or whatever but were closing in on that we still dont have a big senior class but at least we have a lot of guys who have played and i think there is a big difference between playing a freshman that has never played and a redshirt freshman who at least had a taste of it
8791807 i think were comfortable at a lot of positions right now
8791808 but i think the offensive line is still the no 1 spot where depth is an issue building this thing is a process
8791809 given that a debate appearance has been scheduled in my hometown of danbury
8791810 i would be happy in the interest of fairness to participate in a debate hosted in your adopted hometown of
8791811 i would be shocked if hes not there a week from sunday
8791812 he would have to have a dramatic setback right now every step weve taken has been good
8791813 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8791814 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8791815 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8791816 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8791817 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8791818 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8791819 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8791820 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like no 1 probably not but i cant judge too much on that because i really havent had chance to practice
8791821 this kind of loss i had today is just incentive to work harder to go back on the court and to keep working hard and practicing and improving
8791822 i thought i can slowly get into the match and she played completely different than i expected
8791823 she was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots so i really struggled and made too many unforced errors and my serve was not working really well in the third set i created a lot of opportunities for myself just didnt quite use them that was very very frustrating
8791824 maybe i was a little bit also too hard on myself at some moments
8791825 many people said i have the best draw as i ever had in the last two or three years because i never really had good draws especially in the grand slams
8791826 but that doesnt matter if youre playing well if youre doing the right things doesnt matter if you have a good or bad draw youre going to go a long way
8791827 above all obamas form of pragmatism is heavily empirical he wants to know what will work
8791828 we affirm the district courts ruling that the government deprived defendants appellees of their right to counsel under the sixth amendment by causing kpmg to place conditions on the advancement of legal fees to defendants appellees and to cap the fees and ultimately end them

8791832 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
8791833 klpga players agree that for players who want to play on lpga tour english is a necessary thing
8791834 but they also think language cant be a means to restrict
8791835 we think its like discrimination we know its very important to speak english in america and to be friendly with people we all know but its not the standard the method to cut or pass a player on the lpga
8791836 america has this image of equality this rule might ruin that
8791837 under this policy all members must demonstrate that they can communicate in english in the following areas of our business interaction with amateurs during tournament pro ams media interviews and winner acceptance speeches including thanking sponsors fans and volunteers by the end of 2008 the lpga will develop detailed criteria for this new policy and will distribute it to the tour members
8791838 were pretty strong on our stance on everything like drug testing
8791839 so it doesnt surprise me that we are taking an aggressive stance on it and were giving international players ample time
8791840 i have friends who will turn the tv off or find other things to watch if koreans are in the lead
8791841 a couple of weeks ago there were seven or eight of them carolyn bivens has to protect the business of the future and the television package shes trying to design so i think it is terrific
8791842 foreign born players are needed here and they help enhance the united states global image and competitiveness
8791843 we should make them feel welcome encouraged and appreciated it does not make economic sense to create an atmosphere in which foreign born players feel unfairly treated because english proficiency is not performance relevant with respect to playing golf
8791844 the reason im not going to outright consider legislation right now is im still waiting on a callback from the lpga
8791845 id like to see the written policy and have a conversation with them about why this is necessary im willing to work with them but as a state legislator im very concerned about this policy being potentially discriminatory
8791846 whether federal employment discrimination laws or state public accommodation laws or some other type of civil rights laws may apply to prohibit the lpgas rule is something that im sure is going to be debated and possibly litigated in the future
8791847 for us it really does come down to the fact that we dont see that english proficiency is something that is necessary to compete and excel at the game of golf
8791848 its difficult to argue with their goals and what they consider to be a need
8791849 its a decision thats going to be too offensive to too many people that a large corporation cant associate itself with it
8791850 ea sees second hand sales of ps3 xbox and wii games as evil
8791851 comparable to second hand sales in the normal physical goods area
8791852 just a shake of the hips and people literally fall on their face trying to chase this guy down
8791853 if this did indeed start from a fire pit you can see how fast it spread up into the attic spreads very quickly and very difficult to contain those fires
8791854 with a fire pit you really need to douse them with water to make sure they are out because the size of the logs you might not know its out itll smolder and get embers and later could start something on fire and just make sure they are out
8791855 its weird to look down and hey theyre not sweating
8791856 when i was younger growing up i had social anxiety didnt like new situations meeting new people
8791857 most patients go back to work after two or three days
8791858 now my confidence has grown so much i can go and meet new people im a happier person
8791859 is a man of integrity he is a leader he understands the dynamics of our community and we really do believe he understands the needs of naperville
8791860 and he already has the respect right off the bat from naperville and from the park district as well
8791861 im going to be at the top but certainly ill rely on the leadership team to challenge me on certain things and say that may have worked in law enforcement but here it doesnt work that way and i want that
8791862 i dont want yes men and women and im going to challenge them too
8791863 i think the board felt that was appropriate under the circumstances given the history of its relationships with directors and i think its trying to make sure its a good fit before it commits to a long term relationship
8791864 i certainly hope this is the last director for a really long time because i plan on staying until they push me out the doors
8791865 as a result of the circuit courts abandonment of its policy issuing recognizance bonds the cook county jail will once again become overcrowded
8791866 there are four bcs schools in the state of florida florida south florida florida state and miami nobody else in that room
8791867 i sill cant believe pitt took him back they have a perfect brew of shit at that school to open up a portal to hell
8791868 i am not going to say a thing ive got a mortgage to pay

8791872 he wanted to watch it at home with his family its a historic moment
8791873 the cuts have to do with the budget what happened last night doesnt change the fiscal shape that we were in when the budget came in out of balance not sure how you make that connection
8791874 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8791875 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8791876 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8791877 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8791878 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8791879 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8791880 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8791881 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8791882 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8791883 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8791884 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8791885 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8791886 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8791887 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8791888 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8791889 slew of ps3 exclusive titles sky gods and seed project revealed
8791890 dont do it theres no crying in baseball dont do it
8791891 i think at 20 years it is time for me to set the lead and say to the others you work out what you want to do after that
8791892 tony has done a fantastic job given the health problems he has had most people would not appreciate what he has been through
8791893 in fairness theres been a lot of rain in the region lately but these are the worst putting surfaces i have ever putted on
8791894 its very disappointing as my stroke average for first rounds continues to be around 78
8791895 not true they arent appearing and were never going to i dont know where this story came from
8791896 has offended the religious feelings of many people who consider the cross a symbol of gods love and of our redemption
8791897 pokes fun at the catholic population and offends religion and the pope
8791898 some might think that croucher brewing was at a disadvantage because porter is traditionally a good match for chocolate but our pale ale has intense fruity flavours and aromas which complemented the dessert
8791899 its fantastic because it adds yet another dimension to what rotorua can offer visitors
8791900 the injuries suffered by this man are horrific extreme violence has been used it is among the worst beatings that i have seen for a long time
8791901 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8791902 tonight i say to the people of america to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8791903 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8791904 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8791905 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8791906 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there

8791922 there are certain stories that dont end the way that they end in the book its not really family stuff its more like well theres a bit in the book about demi moore and i dancing on the bar
8791923 shes dancing up on me and humping me from behind the one part thats not in the book is that she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends
8791924 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me

8791944 despite these conditions our residential sales in australia remained strong especially in the premium segment of the market
8791945 the main challenge facing us in the 2008 2009 financial year is the soft market conditions for our residential carpets in new zealand and australia
8791946 our budget for the 2008 09 financial year shows a modest increase in earnings but these could dissipate if there were to be any further softening in the residential carpet markets in new zealand and australia

8791956 you know to me it starts really really simply when i read a script i am picturing myself in the movie theatre and from the first idea of the movie im saying if im sitting in a movie theatre do i want to see that and i think a lot of times people make movies for other reasons than for the enjoyment of the people who are going to go see it
8791957 for me it is always about if im sitting in a movie theatre and the trailer comes up for an alcoholic superhero do i want to go see it like just already the idea of it is interesting if the trailer comes on and it says the last man on earth do you want to see that and its like that germ and a lot of times if that germ isnt there it will be very difficult to create an interesting movie
8791958 its what we do for a living so i mean there is nothing in this world that i know more about than making movies so if my kids wanna do that its perfect opportunity for me to be a successful parent so for me its its almost perfection

8792004 the rockers have historically been the most courageous and honest musicians in cuba standing up to the castro regime and gorki aguila is the latest in that proud line
8792005 make no mistake about it the bands lyrics harshly criticize the castro dictatorship and that is the real reason aguila is being detained
8792006 aguilas arrest is a blatant case of musical censorship on the part of the regime and shows that nothing has really changed in cuba under raul castro since fidel disappeared from the public eye two years ago
8792007 we need to stand together and honor these men with the guts to do what the vast majority of musicians in my impoverished country havent done

8792012 zero involvement in the day to day running of the company with the aussie team retaining management control
8792013 ive always owned 100 per cent of the company so this is a first for us he said
8792014 before i was reliant on securitisation which is non existent he said
8792015 if we have access to wholesale funding we can offer our customers a bigger choice in products
8792016 we can grow the business faster than would have otherwise been the case
8792017 cba has always focused on the home loans business and they have the largest home loan share in australia so there is an alignment of objectives
8792018 for customers it will be business as usual but with a bigger product range
8792019 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry mr norris said
8792020 the financial muscle to seize opportunities in this current period of consolidation in the non bank sector

8792023 this new business model means allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation shipping and private equity he said
8792024 we will cease our principal investment activities sell remaining non core assets and in the future only use the balance sheet to co invest in our managed funds
8792025 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets mr clarke said
8792026 with its previous complex structure allco had entered some non core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding
8792027 they were either unprofitable in the new economic environment or required significant capital to achieve profitable scale he said
8792028 we have determined that capital is better deployed in our three core asset classes which fit our funds management model
8792029 unfortunately this has required the departure of many talented employees to date and will see a further reduction in headcount by up to 50 per cent by the end of june 2009 as we accelerate our restructuring program he said
8792030 the reconstruction of the group is progressing however the business remains in a fragile position and the continued market weakness is making the task difficult mr clarke said
8792031 we are committed to creating a leaner and simpler to understand company with realistic growth opportunities
8792032 we plan to continue to diversify and broaden our fleet with greater exposure to the growth segments particularly in high margin niche areas like lpg and offshore supply mr clarke said
8792033 what were trying to do is not a blaming thing its trying to change the system
8792034 i will not stand by and allow anyone to continually make allegations that strike at the heart of public confidence without appropriate evidence
8792035 it is not appropriate for dr andrew starkey to continue this debate publicly
8792036 if she has evidence of harm to patients i invite her today to take them immediately to the independent health watchdog it is not appropriate that this public debate continue any further

8792043 stronger more prosperous and confident country as a result of peters management of the economy
8792044 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8792045 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8792046 its about action i can talk they can talk we can all talk
8792047 its not hard to do that but it doesnt make any difference
8792048 so its about actions and the challenge to the players is im confident they can do it and i hope theyre confident they can do it
8792049 the group has responded to probably every challenge that has been thrown at them over the past six years
8792050 we started off the season people said we couldnt make the eight weve done that again
8792051 so weve answered a few questions there are now some questions about us again and hopefully we can answer those questions also
8792052 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well but ive still got enormous faith in this group and the team and the players that we can turn it around
8792053 weve got two weeks to do it starting tomorrow night
8792054 can we win next week we absolutely can next week if we play our best footy and get our guys into some form
8792055 and thats the challenge for all of us tomorrow night is to get back into form
8792056 actually ryan is a bit crook today so hes one who might not play tomorrow night
8792057 its just the flu going around he was a bit crook yesterday
8792058 we wont take any risks with him hes probably a 50 50 chance at this stage
8792059 its only natural that the sooner its out of the way the sooner it becomes less of a distraction for our side and for the wider football community
8792060 its not something that were really focusing on in terms of the 100 goals were more interested in getting our structures right and playing good footy leading into the finals
8792061 our focus is all about making sure were in the best possible nick we can be to go as deep as we can in september
8792062 its just all systems go in terms of the structure of our side and the manner we go about it and that hasnt been part of his routine all year and its certainly not going to be part of his routine leading into this weeks game
8792063 if he only kicks one but our team kicks 15 or 20 goals and we win the game then were not too fussed with that
8792064 its a hysterical theme outside our footy club but within our footy club its just sticking to the structure of what we do well
8792065 it has got significance for us and i think its got significance for carlton too theyd like to finish the season on a good note so i expect them to be going hard from go to whoa
8792066 we want to get some momentum leading into the finals
8792067 its not the be all and end all but certainly winning forms good form
8792068 the rest will do crawford the world of good hes played four on end and hes got through those games really well and played well enough to convince us he can have an impact in the finals
8792069 we think a fresh shane crawford in the first week of the finals will be really good for our club

8792075 texas teachers know firsthand whats going on in the classrooms they know vouchers are a cop out
8792076 they know they need a raise and they know that our tyranny of standardized testing is the tail wagging the dog i think we need to reform our curriculum to better prepare our next generation to tackle the economic challenges of the 21st century and not just to take yet another standardized test and im honored to have the support of texas teachers in this endeavor

8792080 prior period adjustments arising out of a reassessment of accounting treatments
8792081 we have said publicly we will re look at every type of related party transaction
8792082 having said that its always been disclosed in the annual report theres nothing that weve ever hidden i think people just like to keep speculating on it to make it look like theres something sinister going on and theres not
8792083 absolutely not we have to be very conscious of separating the financial aspect of the business to what we actually do within the centres
8792084 we wish jay well and will miss him not personally of course but in the sense of noticing he is no longer here at least for a few days

8792100 and id have gotten away with it too if it hadnt been for those meddlesome hacks

8792105 in economically challenging times typical trends have advertising budgets moving more towards executions and media that are more performance driven and trackable
8792106 this generally results in greater online share and within the online ecosystem greater emphasis on performance media pricing and executions we have seen many changes to budgets and plans over the last few months moving specifically in this direction

8792119 it was kind of here and there guys got on base i put papelbon in a bad situation
8792120 we got ourselves in a situation where were looking for hopefully a strikeout
8792121 he had faced giambi six times and struck him out four we were in a little bit of a box there he tried to elevate and didnt get it up enough
8792122 i felt a lot of anxiety and nervous butterflies before the start
8792123 then i settled into the game it was a great game unfortunately we ended up on the wrong side of it
8792124 i thought the ball off of mo was out when he hit it
8792125 i thought it was going to find its way to the seats
8792126 it hit square it didnt hit soft theres no art to catching foul tips i wish there was an art if there was an art bullpen coach and catching instructor gary tuck would teach it
8792127 hes not quite 100 percent as much for his peace of mind as anything hes going to go see dr andrews today
8792128 its just the way its feeling its not quite 100 percent we dont want to put any pitcher in a position where hes not 100 percent
8792129 when i fell behind i got back in the count and made some good pitches when i needed to get out of some jams
8792130 i got into some jams and i got out of some jams but obviously this isnt the outcome you want
8792131 but we had a good road trip and hopefully we can carry the momentum back home and continue to play well i felt good pretty good all game this is a tough lineup to get outs against and i was fortunate to get a couple of pop outs when i needed them and no damage down

8792133 the ruling should be required reading for the executives of every web 2 0 business that relies on user generated content
8792134 the finest australian feat of arms on the western front
8792135 it is simply outrageous that this mountain of information was not better protected and it is equally outrageous that we are hearing about a possible six million additional individuals and businesses six months after the fact
8792136 we fear a substantial number connecticut residents are among this latest group had the hundreds of thousands of connecticut residents affected been notified immediately that their data had been compromised they could have taken steps to protect themselves
8792137 nothing in the data we were given in may and june by bny mellon indicated in any way that these additional six million individuals and businesses were involved
8792138 this certainly raises serious additional questions about how secure personal identifying data is at the bank of new york mellon and widens the scope of our investigation
8792139 they are counting on the american labor movement for boots on the ground and mobilization and its nice to be thought of that way
8792140 he has a lot of plans but he has not always articulated them in a passionate enough way
8792141 ive seen that message delivered its in his gut he just needs to be doing it more often
8792142 people will vote against their own economic interests out of fear out of demagoguery out of racism
8792143 what the mccain campaign has deteriorated to is scaring away voters it has created an atmosphere where there is fear and hesitance about senator obama
8792144 this election is about whether voters are comfortable voting for obama
8792145 i believe this election is close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change obama represents
8792146 we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama the next president of the united states
8792147 im always going to remember being a little part of this
8792148 i care about the speech but im probably not going to remember most of what he says standing up here waving the flag talking to everybody around us in the stands all of that makes you feel like a part of something
8792149 i never thought id see a night like this in my lifetime
8792150 we had to apply for credentials and when we got them we knew we would come i mean a part of me still cant believe were here at something as big as this
8792151 you didnt even think about it you didnt talk about it
8792152 people were struggling struggling for the right to vote to end segregation in many parts of the american south people were so afraid they were afraid to be afraid
8792153 as the drama of the primary unfolded more and more what barack obamas campaign did and what it was saying to the country and to me personally was so akin to the movement
8792154 the revolution is at hand and we must free ourselves of the chains of political and economic slavery
8792155 to those who have said be patient and wait we must say that patience is a dirty and nasty word we cannot be patient we do not want to be free gradually we want our freedom and we want it now we cannot depend on any political party for both the democrats and the republicans have betrayed the basic principles of the declaration of independence
8792156 first of all i think shes so smart so gifted but shes also been a wonderful friend along with her husband theyve been like family and i thought she would make a great president
8792157 some people think barack obama just appeared on the scene overnight but it was a movement a struggle that produced this man that created a climate for this personality to emerge
8792158 in him is the embodiment of the hopes and dreams and aspirations and suffering of so many people people say hes not of the civil rights movement but hes a byproduct of that movement and theres no way you can forget that
8792159 were here to represent our ancestors yes indeedy every one of them
8792160 i must have spent 400 on buttons and shirts everybody says bring me something back but its not a problem i understand what theyre feeling
8792161 we already have our airline tickets to d c for the inaugural
8792162 i would like to see a qualified negro as president of the united states
8792163 but i suspect that even if this were today possible the necessities of the office would shape his actions far more than his racial identity
8792164 my first grandbaby is going to turn 1 on saturday
8792165 and for me this day represents new possibilities for her i want things for her to be different i dont want her to get paid 75 cents on the dollar like we are
8792166 they come up to me is he going to be okay is he going to make it little kids in many instances they cant even pronounce his name
8792167 i struggled the first few months it was an uncertain time
8792168 the honest answer is i dont know i have nothing in mind
8792169 i cant recall a time when i had greater happiness
8792170 either i can get on with my life or i could roll the dice i concluded i just really needed to get on with my life
8792171 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
8792172 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
8792173 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
8792174 i wish we had americans and american weapons but its not the case
8792175 they are living in a parallel world with a parallel perception if you say a lie in russia it becomes the truth the next day on tv
8792176 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8792177 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8792178 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8792179 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8792180 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8792181 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8792182 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8792183 we are planning for our convention to open on monday
8792184 like all americans we are monitoring the situation closely in the gulf
8792185 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
8792186 our nation needs a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain
8792187 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend
8792188 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8792189 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8792190 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8792191 brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8792192 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8792193 they need to turn themselves in because this is not right i couldve lost my daughter last night and just turned 14 today

8792204 one day ill come and live with you in devon by the sea i want to be with you i love you james
8792205 really pronounced rahly i dont know anyone courting for that long it rahly is a fairytale
8792206 i am not prepared to discuss how i had sex with diana
8792207 i would put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
8792208 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8792209 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8792210 i prepared really hard during the course of training camp and during the duration of the preseason i feel like im prepared and ready to go for next week
8792211 ive gotten better in terms of understanding the offense being more familiar with what were trying to do as a team and whats expected of the quarterback position
8792212 i dont think anybody would have thought this was going to happen a couple weeks ago i mean its pretty crazy for smith to get sick and something to happen to somebodys shoulder but ive done what ive been asked
8792213 we were able to keep that football team out of the end zone that puts us 13 straight quarters without giving up an offensive touchdown
8792214 i didnt stand there for two days and plan our girls doing that
8792215 it was a spontaneous reaction i knew we had won the national title i knew there would not be another opportunity for the four seniors to take their curtain call i didnt stand there and think about it it was a reaction had i known there was a gymnast performing i would not have done that i regret that
8792216 they felt they needed to act in some manner to further let us know that it was an offense that would not be tolerated
8792217 i dont think it will keep us from hosting it in the future
8792218 our institution and our athletic department hosted a fantastic event a lot has been made of something that really in the end was a gray area that we received a proper warning on i really dont think that the people on that committee are the kind of people that look at things like that and hold a grudge mistakes were made and consequences were doled out
8792219 to take the emotion and humanity out of an extraordinary performance is preposterous in my mind i dont understand why we over govern ourselves
8792220 my goal is to get the ncaa tournament and win some games there
8792221 weve never been to the tournament while ive played here its my last year and im going for it all i want to see an ncaa banner in the ramsey center before i leave
8792222 our end all focus for the season is to get to the tournament and once we get there to win
8792223 our goal is to get there by taking every weekend series and putting some wins in that column
8792224 selecting maria taylor to the all sec preseason team is a no brainer to me
8792225 it shows the respect shes gained from the other coaches in this league the other coaches know thats not only our go to player but shes a competent go to player in the league
8792226 coach has taught me so much in just one year i couldnt have done anything without him
8792227 the freshmen we have on our court are experienced very high level club athletes coming in
8792228 last year we relied on three freshmen to come in and it worked pretty well
8792229 i have complete trust in our freshmen they can have the same impact as anyone else
8792230 the first win we want regardless of when it comes into play
8792231 i dont want to say that it isnt important milestones are a reflection of how long youve been at it but the other part is the reflection of the special kinds of teams youve had
8792232 i dont want to sit here with false humility and say it doesnt mean anything to me because it would be a very special moment especially against our in state rival georgia tech to pick up that milestone
8792233 were thinking about adding in a few checks and balances you know keeping honest people honest
8792234 we dont want to see the art of revenuing die
8792235 so were handing it off to you youre the next generation
8792236 to say that youve got a pint of apple or peach brandy that was made in a georgia still has a certain cache to it if its made like it ought to be theres nothing wrong with it per se but you know theyre not going to make it like they ought to
8792237 just about the time we were getting ready to start i got pneumonia and that knocked me out of commission for two months
8792238 and weve had a few drummers there are four on the record including brad morgan of drive by truckers in this band frank and i are basically the pound cake and joe adds the frosting beyond that theres not a lot of room to play josh has been with us since november and this was basically his first real recording session but he was able to handle everything we threw at him
8792239 we wound up recording several versions one of which is basically piano bass drums and a little splash of guitar its a little darker and i actually prefer that version but one of the hardest decisions ive ever had to make was cutting garsons piano solo but he was thrilled with both versions and called it a substantial piece of work and theres no higher compliment in my mind
8792240 i hope to call on garson again someday if he can fit it into his schedule
8792241 when you get to work with your favorite musician well what can i say its not exactly what people expect from us
8792242 im glad to let go of the record because we jumped in way over our heads
8792243 but if anything were at the start the next time we play a show it will be the beginning of the satisfactionista era for me
8792244 we tried our best to make a classic rock record and i believe we achieved it
8792245 i just hope we can back the album up and deliver if im satisfied with it i know its a great record
8792246 one of my goals is to let athens know were here
8792247 there are a lot of great bands in this town and we can take on any of them there are a lot of bands here who i feel arent really trying theyre cruising that drives me crazy were just hoping to get the word out
8792248 i dont know why people want to believe its anything more than the family getting together and deciding
8792249 but ive got this story i like to tell i tell them that we closet ourselves together and when we reach a decision we send up puffs of red and black smoke youd be surprised how many people want to believe that
8792250 we look at the tail and how it sits up against the dog and with two definite crooks in it not a long tail like down his backside like you see on some dogs
8792251 we look at the way they hold their ears theyre strong as hell and theyve got massive shoulders we look at the chest as they develop and how they walk uga vi had a magnificent wobble back and forth back and forth those are the kind of things we look at
8792252 these dogs are family pets and we breed them to have a backup dog but we dont tell the public that
8792253 when vi died all we told dr michael adams uga president and athletic director damon evans was dont worry weve got it covered they never asked another question because theyve got confidence in what we select
8792254 i wish we could take credit for that but thats part of the breed
8792255 theyre not an aggressive dog they dont see a child and want to harm a child if they get frisky we know how to pull back on the leash to keep him away from anything that might be bothering him
8792256 the one that we will be introducing has already had on his shirt
8792257 he took to it like a duck takes to water you could almost sense that he was in his element and he was ready to go
8792258 broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8792259 stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8792260 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8792261 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8792262 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8792263 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8792264 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8792265 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8792266 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8792267 when were able to play more guys it helps us throughout the year
8792268 the schedule that we play year in and year out and moreso this year were going to need guys that can give us 15 to 20 reps a game in roles
8792269 in the hawaii game they had everybody repping some of those guys were twos and threes at the beginning of the year hopefully at the end of the season well be able to be in that same situation
8792270 i thought that one of the biggest keys to our team last year was playing a lot of guys
8792271 we played more guys on defense than i think weve ever played in season not because we had to or injuries but because we felt like these guys had earned the right to play we got them in there we got them experience and they started getting better morale they stayed fresher they stayed healthier it was just a good thing for us weve got a lot of guys coming back that have played a good bit for us hopefully we can continue that trend and add a few youngsters to the fold there
8792272 its certainly good for morale but im not about morale if a guy cant play
8792273 the guy doesnt necessarily have to make plays in order to play hes no different than a role player in basketball his job is not to score his job is to buy us time to let our best player rest or get out of foul trouble play good defense protect the ball youve done your job
8792274 my goal would be when your rotation is in youre out there and dominating
8792275 when the next guy comes in he dominates and we just keep unleashing them on them and we go out and have a great year
8792276 having depth at any position knowing whoever comes in is as capable as the first person thats obviously good for the team not only in the first couple of games but in the long run as far as everybody staying healthy
8792277 you play all of these spread offenses and theyre stretching the field
8792278 they put pressure on the defenses to run to the football i dont know if anybody can play 60 snaps full speed i dont know if thats what you want youve got to have a guy thats fresh
8792279 thomas ended up playing for san diego and playing in the afc championship game that was even harder for me to watch
8792280 i realized i was too short too slow and too weak to play anymore
8792281 football provided me with an education im not the smartest guy in the world but i know how to work hard
8792282 now i wouldnt trade what im doing for anything else in the world im overly blessed to be able to coach high school football in georgia
8792283 he has a lot of good qualities hes not going to get out worked
8792284 he told me i needed to be a head coach again
8792285 i had known jeff for 14 years i learned so much from that man
8792286 but was i making an impact on kids lives the way i needed to it was a great opportunity to do that
8792287 anytime there is a change it is going to be tough
8792288 i felt it was a very good fit smith is very organized and disciplined hes going to do the things that need to be done to get the team together
8792289 we are nowhere near where we are going to be eventually this team will become my team i think part of the team is not mine yet when that happens well put the pedal down
8792290 we are just going to have to play without them
8792291 we asked them to simulate habersham for us and practice hard against us

8792362 as expected the first 15 20 minutes of the game we were a little jittery a little excited but then we settled down
8792363 it was a good performance from our veterans and the young players looked excited and comfortable like they had been playing with each other for months it was a great team effort
8792364 were going to push through health care reform regardless of the views of the american people
8792365 education without values as useful as it is seems rather to make man a more clever devil
8792366 actors like kamal haasan and rajnikant are larger than life they cannot be accepted in guest roles i can get away with small cameos off beat roles walk on parts anything im playing a 90 year old man in a new film
8792367 therere some actors in this country like amitabh bachchan chiranjeevi kamal haasan and rajnikant who are above success and failure theyre blessed people if you say im one of them then i too am blessed
8792368 jackie chan appears in a major action sequence with me im trying to physically prepare for the role ive already shot for about 150 days for nair san in japan and mongolia
8792369 im the first actor from malayalam cinema to feature in a japanese film ive to speak not only in japanese but also in chinese and mongolian
8792370 nair was an indian freedom fighter ive met the man he owns a chain of restaurants ive been to his restaurant in tokyo and he has been to my home in kerala he passed away at the age of 85 86 i feel very privileged to be playing nair the film will definitely get wide release in japan
8792371 ibsens the master builder is a complicated play ive done stage plays including a play in sanskrit but ibsen is tough however i treated the film like any other i play an architect changes were made for example my characters norwegian name was changed for the indian audience
8792372 people just pounced on ramu they forgot how much he has achieved in the past such things happen in fact priyadarshan has just offered me a role in a hindi film to be done in the middle of next year i get a lot of hindi films but they dont interest me
8792373 they are mutually claiming the other side started it at the moment its very difficult to confirm who has started it
8792374 we explained that we want dialogue to end this fight
8792375 its not true that were breaking the ceasefire theyre trying to lie because they want war when theyre fighting us how can we disarm
8792376 based on one of the biggest horror icons of all time the games name plot or what systems it will be available for have yet to be revealed
8792377 the completely new title changes things up from past renegade kid projects in terms of gameplay genre and style
8792378 our first venture with gamecock dementium was an ideal partnership for us
8792379 our new game has been a pet project of ours for a while now and it not only felt natural but necessary that we team up with gamecock again were really looking forward to working with these talented folks again
8792380 the exciting thing about working with renegade kid and what we learned the first time around is that theyll stick to their guns and put everything they have into it
8792381 this new title is incredible and a huge leap forward for them and the genre
8792382 it is also shocking to know that beverages like palm wine and pito are also adulterated and surprisingly for palm wine water sugar saccharine miracle berry monosodium glutamate baking soda and tobacco leaves were added to sweeten them
8792383 potassium bromate e924 used in bread has the chance of causing cancer and nitrate used in tendering meat and beans could cause cancer and tumours in the liver kidney trachea oesophagus and lungs
8792384 i am proud of the work weve done together over the past five years and am focused on the agenda weve set for the city of phoenix for the future
8792385 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
8792386 the major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair
8792387 a common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools
8792388 at this point the future is so cloudy in terms of the development of the market when its going to pick up again
8792389 then i see a very good opportunity that basically i would hope that everything could be break even to profitable
8792390 we would hope to have the corporation profitable again by then
8792391 we are selling every hhr and cobalt we can make with either minimal or zero incentives whereas three years ago even the hhr you had to put 3 000 bucks on it to move it so i think in practice the price of small cars has gone up three or four thousand dollars
8792392 if anyone can make a comeback its michael jackson but my god hes really going to have to get it right can he do it well the jurys still out musically hes going to have to do something as momentous as elvis presleys 68 comeback special it depends on how well hes holding it together michael is going to have to get a new brand a new gimmick and a new sound
8792393 the biggest question is does michael jackson want to come back at 50 has he got the energy has he got the desire his career has been a rollercoaster over the last ten years and crucially im not sure hes got the appetite to
8792394 blahblahblahblahblah climate change blahblahblahblah hope and change blahblah blah blah blah bush sucks blahblah blahblahblahblahblah im still made that i lost blahblahblahblahblah
8792395 our nations discourse has turned into a petty squabble too many people have failed us oh but not the democrats no those other guys

8792412 sesungguhnya orang orang yang bertaqwa apabila mereka disentuh oleh sesuatu imbasan hasutan dari syaitan mereka ingat kepada ajaran allah maka dengan itu mereka nampak jalan yang benar
8792413 sesungguhnya pada kejadian langit dan bumi dan pada pertukaran malam dan siang ada tanda tanda kekuasaan kebijaksanaan dan keluasan rahmat allah bagi orang orang yang berakal iaitu orang orang yang menyebut dan mengingati allah semasa mereka berdiri dan duduk dan semasa mereka berbaring mengiring dan mereka pula memikirkan tentang kejadian langit dan bumi sambil berkata
8792414 mereka hanya mengetahui perkara yang zahir nyata dari kehidupan dunia sahaja dan mereka tidak pernah ingat hendak mengambil tahu tentang hari akhirat patutkah mereka merasa cukup dengan mengetahui yang demikian sahaja dan tidak memikirkan dalam hati mereka supaya mereka dapat mengetahui bahawa allah tidak menciptakan langit dan bumi serta segala yang ada di antara keduanya itu melainkan dengan ada gunanya yang sebenar dan dengan ada masa penghujungnya yang tertentu juga untuk kembali menemui penciptanya dan sebenarnya banyak di antara manusia orang orang yang sungguh ingkar akan pertemuan dengan tuhannya b tanggapan yang negatif terhadap budaya berfikir itu sendiri most people think that in order to think deeply

8792425 in the media what business owners and managers need to do to better motivate their people and shift from surviving to thriving again
8792426 we think to come in there and get a guy who started and has as much experience as he has is an opportunity for us when we look initially at our backup situation
8792427 we dont have those kinds of starters on the team that was a plus for us

8792437 ich werde diesen krieg im irak verantwortungsvoll beenden ebenso wie den kampf gegen al kaida und die taliban in afghanistan
8792438 verdacht dass jemand in den vereinigten staaten diesen konflikt absichtlich mit dem ziel erzeugt hat die situation zu verschlechtern und einem der kandidaten im kampf um das amt des us pr sidenten einen vorteil zu verschaffen
8792439 wenn dies best tigt wird ist das sehr schlecht es ist sehr gef hrlich

8792444 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8792445 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the democratic nominee for president of the united states
8792446 hes being looked at in cases involving stabbings and death
8792447 the victim continuously screamed and begged for him to stop and for defendant larson to call the police which larson ignored and just told the victim to own up to what she did
8792448 we will look at the finances of the park district and do as much as we can to preserve the level of services which has suffered over the years
8792449 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8792450 i think you have to give those guys some credit over there
8792451 theyve got a pretty good pitching staff that will shut you down
8792452 i made a couple of mistake pitches and they hit them over the fence
8792453 im really proud of the fact that weve really raised the level of our intensity despite only having 12 000 people in the stands
8792454 theyve been very professional about this thats the part i really appreciate about it also youd like to see 36 000 every night but for right now the way our guys are going about our business im very proud of them
8792455 im proud of him because its hard to stay out of trouble when youre in trouble and trouble tends to find out
8792456 were going to try and keep him on the straight and narrow and hes going to make sure hes ok
8792457 hes just got to be consistent throwing strikes tonight he had the confidence you could just see it out there it was fun to be a part of and fun to catch
8792458 we havent had a very good month swinging the bats the pitchers have been able to do a good job but we havent been doing enough with the bats we obviously have a big series coming up with the wets and well try to turn it around against them
8792459 i would be shocked if hes not there a week from sunday
8792460 he would have to have a dramatic setback right now every step weve taken has been good
8792461 he wanted to see how loose hed be after the wait in the locker room that type of thing
8792462 we had an exercise bike out there for him but i think hes pretty happy with how the routine went
8792463 what we wanted to do was really kind of simulate what he was going to do on game day see how everything felt and see if he wanted to alter his routine for next sunday
8792464 i think he came away feeling pretty good about it he told me on the sidelines that if he started he would have felt in good shape and ready to go
8792465 it looks like theres going to be a parade but there isnt one
8792466 its just a little crazy its like a circus outside
8792467 any visible changes in security will be coordinated with the chicago police department and other city officials we will make every effort to ensure that any adjustments in security affecting area residents will be as unobtrusive as possible
8792468 i want him to be secure but maybe my landlord can offer reduced rent for the hassle
8792469 my mother had to park four blocks away yesterday when she came to my house
8792470 its an inconvenience but he needs the extra protection imagine how it will be if he wins
8792471 wed been looking for that one thing that says here come the republicans
8792472 and nothing says winner like the performance those girls put on at the olympics its that winning image we want right beside our man mccain
8792473 whats he gonna do next hand out bumper stickers or buttons or t shirts emblazoned with some nice lead paint
8792474 besides by the time mccain comes on stage isnt it just a little past those girls bedtimes
8792475 look at all the whining and crying and complaining when the judging didnt go their way at the olympics while those chinese girls handled everything with grace and dignity
8792476 we specifically this semester are interested in bringing someone with a political background because of the proximity to the election
8792477 we had hoped to bring someone that had some knowledge and some excitement factor in the political arena and john edwards obviously fit that description at the time
8792478 oh but there are so many people out there that have it much worse or who have gone through so much more
8792479 we worked against him in denver we were impressed with the guy hes more out type than their type they are a sideways finesse team hes more of a pwoer guy i guess thts why they wanted to trade him we think hes a good player he started for them every game lastyear once you lose kosier you look around and see whats available hes a veteran player i think he can get ready quickly what well do depends on hoq quickly he can get ready and what our other guys look like
8792480 we wont have anybody out there that has not been on the team trying to move the ball against cleveland
8792481 its too early to determine if any charges will be filed
8792482 every missing persons report we investigate as a possible homicide
8792483 if someone knows something about pedro lugos whereabouts please report it to mission police we fear for her life
8792484 its an event to showcase local businesses and bring some attention to the downtown district
8792485 we want people to know there is more to san juan
8792486 there are restaurants that are landmarks and areas that people wouldnt otherwise see
8792487 were trying to give everyone a different outlook about san juan and taking steps in the right direction
8792488 were really putting ourselves out there and hopefully not just a one stop shop and leave kind of place
8792489 weve asked all of the downtown merchants to open their doors and offer great deals
8792490 a lot of older businesses have been there for years and this will be a chance for people to see what they have
8792491 its going to be a busy day but were excited to help foster community awareness
8792492 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet
8792493 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8792494 there was some anxiety that was felt going into the convention
8792495 but delegates from both sides got to interact and realize were all democrats theres a palatable shift
8792496 our main focus now is to make sure that our community comes out and votes
8792497 it was a good match for us but we have to tighten up our game if we are to keep going
8792498 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8792499 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8792500 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8792501 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8792502 he hated it when pictures started appearing of him with a belly and love handles tom has a private gym at his home and david has been working out with him
8792503 i think it was sort of ironic but it couldnt have happened at a better time to me its more of a fulfillment thats actually taking place
8792504 im very struck by the fact that we are on the cusp of doing some great things in our country and really changing some things with our history and with the thoughts and the ideas that are happening
8792505 we just felt that we are not getting the involvement from the city like we think that we should so we decided kinda to take matters into our own hands
8792506 beckhams story is a modern day fairytale of heroes villains love manchester united and what it means to lead your country
8792507 his rise from obscurity to international stardom his universally acknowledged gifts as a supreme sportsman and his hollywood lifestyle all have the elements of an aspirational fable
8792508 i dont want her to look like shes going into a convent school but its just a little too much for a 15 year old if i didnt know better id swear she was 25
8792509 you will now be designing everyday wear for billionaire troll children make it work
8792510 the thing that was really painful to me and our staff is we want to give people a reason to believe
8792511 we want to keep em around keep em excited and we didnt do that tonight that to me is very disturbing and very painful im embarrassed that i think we didnt do a good job representing baylor university as a football program
8792512 appears to be besides zunes sharps only other self appointed defender
8792513 would have no problem imperialistically imposing a nonviolent strategy upon those inhabiting other parts of the world
8792514 critics of the aei it seems are either racists or here echoing mccarthyism marxist leninists or preferably both
8792515 a big destabilization plan aiming to overthrow chavez government and to pave the way for an international intervention
8792516 provoke repressive reactions by the state that would then justify crises of human right violations and lack of constitutional order
8792517 toward the formulation of what was called operation guarimba a series of often violent street blockades that resulted in several deaths
8792518 in almost every country where that strategy worked there were governments with little popular support
8792519 while zunes focuses on issues of personal history what is more crucial is political fact
8792520 i challenge golinger or anyone else to produce any supposed
8792521 las fallas en el pavimento ah est n ni c mo negarlas y todo es nicamente por la mala calidad en los trabajos realizados
8792522 we have seen tasmania wholeheartedly embrace tigers low fare revolution as a result of the great reaction to our product and the additional brand new planes we are taking delivery of we are delighted to be adding more flights to our tasmanian destinations
8792523 our competitors have been frustrated by us keeping our cards close to our chest but it is obvious with these announcements that we walk the walk when it comes to spreading the low fare revolution in australia we are focused we have a proven game plan and we are sticking to it i can let our competitors know one thing though which is tiger hasnt finished with its growth in australia by a long shot
8792524 no school is like another and mr rudd risks creating so called performing schools when a lot of families dont have a choice of schools they can go to
8792525 provide much richer suites of data to all tasmanian parents and school communities without the need for league tables
8792526 what i would say to our friends in the teachers unions across australia and many of them are fantastic people is that its time to arrive in the 21st century
8792527 that is lets get past the name calling lets get past all this pointless debate blaming someone here or blaming someone there
8792528 presumably what some of our friends in the trade unions would like us to do is just hand over a blank cheque well guess what i am not going to do that
8792529 its not right to have a situation where schools have been underfunded for more than a decade now he says come up with the goods or else
8792530 escalating strategies are being considered by the union nationally his plan is too simplistic
8792531 we have some real concerns about adequately funding all schools so we can achieve what the government wants us to achieve
8792532 im glad prime minister rudd and premier bartlett have finally come to their senses and adopted a policy they once vehemently opposed
8792533 the elderly want to show younger people that ageing can be a good thing
8792534 we dont just sit about in rocking chairs we are active and we are ageing positively
8792535 positive ageing is the buzzword at the moment and that is about showing people that getting old can be a positive thing
8792536 one of the reasons we need to do them on this sort of scale is because when we conduct our own training and development we can do it within our own agencies
8792537 the important thing about this sort of exercise is we get together with the other agencies and exercise our communication procedures while trying to develop a better understanding of how the other agencies work so collectively we can respond in a more effective way

8792551 this is a bill that is going to be subjugated to public consultation and i dont think there are reasons for this commotion
8792552 destabilizing the country playing with fear and keeping information from the venezuelan people
8792553 the publication yesterday monday in the newspaper el universal in which it as indicated that within the national assembly there is telecommunications bill up for quick approval is totally false we think that this has been written in a media campaign with a view towards the upcoming elections of 23 november trying to say that the national government seeks to monopolize the system of media of the country

8792565 no s ustedes pero yo no estoy dispuesto a apostar que la posibilidad de cambio sea del 10 por ciento
8792566 la creencia de que podemos lograr todo lo que nos propongamos es lo que ha caracterizado a este pa s pero ahora esta creencia est en peligro porque estamos en un momento en que estamos en guerra nuestra econom a est agitada y el sue o americano est de nuevo bajo amenaza
8792567 nosotros lo medimos por la cantidad de gente que tiene un trabajo que le permite pagar la hipoteca o ahorrar para la educaci n de sus hijos nosotros no lo medimos por el n mero de multimillonarios que hay en nuestro pa s o por los beneficios de nuestras corporaciones

8792605 i would say probably theyre about as far as they could come under these circumstances that is working against the same players and the same defenses
8792606 now they need those other schemes and other players to continue to progress
8792607 year after year the continued success of the mens final four demonstrates it is one of americas great events

8792609 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet

8792611 there was some anxiety that was felt going into the convention

8792629 its going to be an exhausting process its going to be hard physically to get through it
8792630 you want to capture that big idea and press it at every opportunity with dispatch and gusto
8792631 if youre right to go to barack obama and youre worried about him for whatever reasons then if you hear from your neighbor that personal kind of validation takes on greater importance for barack obama than is typically the case
8792632 the number one thing is that you have to change the mindset of the last few years
8792633 you have to turn that mindset around that we are capable of winning and that we are going to win the first thing with the players is letting them know that we are going to win we just have to believe we are going to win
8792634 each of the candidates talked about the challenges they are going to have rebuilding this program
8792635 it is not going to happen over night it is going to take a couple of years to get us going down the right path

8792641 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8792642 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
8792643 thats one of the reasons we took him when you have a guy like that who can change the game its bigger than big
8792644 i was just using my speed and believing in it
8792645 that was really big for me going into the season it will be a big confidence maker for me

8792689 everything starts by the aural reception by hearing we first hear about krsna and by doing this process we become purified and then we may understand more about the philosophy and then apply it in our lives everyone starts by hearing the bhakti yoga system starts like that according to srila prabhupada he says the hearing is the most important process of all the nine because once you start hearing you concentrate and by concentrating you can engage the mind and it will become cleansed so by doing this you can understand the lord and see him all the time
8792690 thats why while we are chanting we need to hear otherwise the mind wont be engaged in this process and you cant see the process working on your life you cant feel krsnas association through this chanting once you feel eager to know more about the lord and want to engage yourself more in the process of bhakti yoga means your hearing is working and your mind is being cleaned and properly engaged below is the quote from srila prabhupada about the topic i have just described

8792700 the man who else would that or could that be referred by none other than barack hussein obama
8792701 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8792751 another view that is being addressed to the ummah is the concept of fighting the rulers and that through military struggle islam will return to the world stage again this is based upon a particular hadith it has been narrated from many sources including imam muslim that the prophet saw said do not challenge the people of authority unless you see explicit kufr of which you have clear proof from allah from islam ibn kathir in his tafseer states that if the khaleefah reverts to the rule of disbelief he would be fought until he returned to the implementation of islam and the shariah ibn hajr in his fateh al bari also states that if he becomes a kafir or changes the shari ah he should be fought and removed this view is also mentioned in nayl al awtar and supported by imam shawkani that is if the ruler rules by other than the shariah he is fought until he either repents or is removed however that is the only situation that it applies to i e the ruling of a khaleefah who resorts to the kufr ruling and disobedience to allah it does not relate to the khaleefah becoming tyrannical and also does not relate to his personality becoming corrupt in which case obedience to him is binding and the muslims should still pray behind him and fight jihad behind him however these ahadith are not connected to the current situation they are all connected to revolt and rising against the khaleefah and are titled under the subject of khurooj min al khaleefah i e rising against the authority of a khaleefah or an imam the current situation is not that of the khulafaa who used to rule by islam and then turned away from islam the current problem is also not merely related to removing a ruler by killing him rather entire systems of kufr have been implemented over muslims for over 76 years none of the rulers have ever ruled by the shari ah and none of them are khulafaa within a khilafah the systems that they are applying are either monarchies or capitalistic with some sort of democratic framework hence the reality isn t that of removing a bad khaleefah within an islamic state the reality is of uprooting an entire kufr system including it s ruler to again establish dar ul islam the current rulers are not comparable in any way to khulafaa who have introduced one kufr law into the khilafah hence these ahadith which have always been understood in the context of dar ul islam i e where islam is implemented and the muslims possess the security do not apply upon the current situation the reality which they address is that of removing a khaleefah who rules with kufr within the islamic state not that of uprooting an entire kufr system merely by fighting and the only situation that is comparable from the evidences is the establishment of the islamic state for the very first time by the prophet saw and the struggle which he saw went through in order to establish this state and change dar ul kufr to dar ul islam this is the struggle which he saw referred to in the hadith of hamza and as is illustrated in the books of sunnah and seerah as that is the only instance in which a complete system of kufr existed and was changed to a complete system of islam so the matter is regarding the changing of a system not merely a ruler the ahadith of fighting apply to changing a ruler i e a khaleefah who has gone astray not a system only the struggle of the prophet saw in makkah applies to the changing of a system so military struggle is not the method of re establishing the khilafah

8792864 any possibility of internet tv by virtue of their bandwidth cap

8792867 omg they have a cap and they told us about it its not fair

8793058 the labour market is expected to loosen as a result of this which in turn is likely to reduce the level of pressure on wage demands increases and inflation falls between now and the autumn will be key to the level of pay awards we see at the start of the major bargaining activity in january 2009
8793059 when inflation begins eating into workers wages it is all the more important to set our sights on settlements that will protect living standards not least when we know that the cost of many essentials is way ahead of the official inflation rate

8793064 i am getting a bit frustrated with the liberal party in the senate mr rudd told fairfax radio today
8793065 raid the budget surplus of 21 7bn by blocking measures worth about 6bn
8793066 that has one consequence less money for the budget to spend on proper purposes and secondly it has the effect of putting further upward pressure on rates
8793067 i thought everyone in the country wanted downward pressure on interest rates
8793068 its all about excuses for past inaction excuses for past neglect excuses for past mismanagement mr ofarrell said
8793069 and an excuse that when we had record revenues instead of investing them in necessary infrastructure they failed to do so

8793095 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents julian walsh acting atsb executive director said today
8793096 the passengers were obviously very lucky atsb investigator julian walsh said in canberra
8793097 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8793098 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8793099 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8793100 these oxygen bottles are actually quite robust so it would take some significant force to do some damage like that
8793101 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8793102 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening mr walsh said
8793103 as far as we can tell from all the information thats available to us the crew have pretty much done a textbook response mr walsh said

8793107 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8793108 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8793109 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8793110 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8793111 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies

8793114 gold honey mustard you can do these colors in lightweight fabrics so its a head start on fall without the bulk
8793115 i think mustard has an automatic warmth to it a lot of the trick of modern fashion is seasonless clothes no one wants to wear heavy clothes even in the fall
8793116 think about it for a skirt or pants like khaki you can wear it with chocolate brown or olive green on top
8793117 its sort of like an oxidized metal color at night its sort of a new way to wear gold
8793118 i think its good in small doses i dont think you want to invest in a coat of this color
8793119 for a coat or a suit its a more colorful camel
8793120 its a flattering color on every woman it will look great in the daytime
8793121 youre going to see a lot of melding of all these colors especially a glen plaid or a check they work like the solid thats not a solid a good investment piece isnt always black pants or a white dress
8793122 she looks like shes going to a great celebratory cocktail party
8793123 its a completely chic dress shes dressed like shes celebrating
8793124 i think only certain people can pull that off i would just look homeless wearing them
8793125 among surrealist techniques exploiting the mystique of accident was a kind of collective collage of words or images called the cadavre exquis exquisite corpse based on an old parlor game it was played by several people each of whom would write a phrase on a sheet of paper fold the paper to conceal part of it and pass it on to the next player for his contribution
8793126 the woman who is wearing mustard is bold and wants to be a trendsetter
8793127 when youre wearing mustard the fabric is usually opaque and pretty strong with your makeup your best bet is to keep it matte matte makeup with matte fabrics
8793128 navy will make the whites of the eyes look brighter and when you wear mustard you want a bright and light face
8793129 i had in mind going full online with my stuff and rent the downstairs out but after i thought about it awhile i decided that wasnt such a good idea

8793159 its really quite mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
8793160 i would just like to say that the free slots are great i never thought i would win the jackpot on the slots but just goes to show anyone can i know its just free points but winning the jackpot gave me a chance to play on foxy bingo for real and winning 64k and the rest off my points i got 65k thats 65 in foxy i just have to say i have played on alot off free bingo sites but this 1 is by far the best gl to everyone playing
8793161 theres no one ready willing and able to look after them
8793162 for the community its just an added boost to economic development in so many ways
8793163 ive shadowed at different high schools before i went to davis and some of the teachers there are just kind of average but here at davis i really like them theyre really special
8793164 some of the teachers its really just like i dont want to be here ill give you this do this dont talk to me
8793165 to expect improvement of that magnitude is not realistic this is just the three year plateau were on it will be very difficult for buildings across the board to hit those targets

8793176 the show is a saga around the fond aspirations of the bahu to become the saas and the humorous obstacles that she encounters in fulfilling such a seemingly simple and innocent fantasy thanks to her own saas who is unwilling to abdicate the throne i am confident that this show will definitely add to our impressive line up of family comedy shows
8793177 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8793178 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8793179 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8793180 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8793181 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8793182 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8793183 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive

8793234 obviously some people are natural talkers and some people arent what if you have a person who genuinely struggles with learning a new language they have a learning disability thats tough to ask somebody with a learning disability who might have found golf as the saving grace in their life to ask them to learn a different language or else you cant play

8793241 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8793242 we love al gore we believe he was cheated in the 2000 election and that he would have been a great president
8793243 were proud that he keeps on serving this country and the world
8793244 mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change climate crisis
8793245 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8793246 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
8793247 we have more then enough problems with pedophiles in this society
8793248 about babies being genderless got me thinking its true babies are completely free from the performance that is gender little boy babies and little girl babies dont act differently its sad that this passes so soon and that little girls are quickly taught to play quietly with dolls whilst little boys are encouraged to be active and inquisitive the very things little girls are told off for being
8793249 were drawn to the range of feelings in the songs as i gave them the backgrounds of the compositions
8793250 i have discovered that young children have open welcoming minds and the more pure and emotional the music the more they connect
8793251 it was a gamble all the way around but i hoped that others might be as eager to hear and experience great jazz as i was without having to drive 30 miles spending big money on gas alone
8793252 pat and paul took a chance that i could deliver the music and the audience the fact that people came out for this evening of entertainment and jazz shows that there is a lot of support and enthusiasm for music and the arts out here even without the hundreds of winter visitors that fill our community every year my goal is to present all of the best jazz artists in arizona throughout the year building a series worthy of its beautiful surroundings
8793253 las declaraciones las listas de temas y los supuestos t tulos de disco que rondan por la red son totalmente falsos
8793254 did you know that i called you i dont think i left a message
8793255 southwest missouri is a very critical part of the total vote in missouri and could make the difference in whether john mccain carries the state or not
8793256 i think greene county and southwest missouri are going to be the real battleground for missouri
8793257 i didnt want to be seen as a specialist in that genre
8793258 but with tokyo sonata i felt that audiences really appreciated the film and found it satisfying it wasnt that they saw it as something weird and exclusively japanese they could relate to it
8793259 if i were offered the chance i would like to try working abroad even in hollywood but i want to make films in my own way if that is appreciated by audiences abroad i want to do it
8793260 i am almost what you could call a rabid fan of ozu and i think i have been influenced by him even in my
8793261 but i have never imitated him in fact ive spent so many years trying to avoid ozu i keep asking myself why the story and even the title have happened to follow on from ozu
8793262 the operations are directed only against the perpetrators of un islamic acts
8793263 tactical adjustments will be made to strike a balance between law enforcement of the law and allowing the proper observance of religious practices during the month of ramadan
8793264 maybe this is how it works for hollywood stars but its not certainly not typical for an olympic athlete
8793265 its no secret he loves mcdonalds and has ever since ive known him
8793266 i said i dont want to retire before the age of 30 right now im not sure
8793267 i really do have a great balanced diet there are some things where i do like to indulge i think everybody does
8793268 thats how i actually started swimming my mom wanted me and my sisters to be water safe
8793269 im interested to see how my comedy is hopefully its pretty good
8793270 that would be cool i have no idea who i could see playing myself
8793271 he hit all the points he needed to hit on
8793272 he touched on what is my story he touched on the stories of my constituents
8793273 when i was a kid growing up my father talked to me about bobby and jack kennedy and dr martin luther king and the vision and spirit they brought
8793274 no matter how eloquent and beautiful barack obamas words are the ugly truth lies in his meager record
8793275 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8793276 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8793277 light vehicle traffic and we have police presence in an area we should explore looking at that
8793278 initially i was a skeptic also i thought the dam should have remained open
8793279 there are 30 billion gallons of water behind that structure if it was compromised it would be catastrophic
8793280 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8793281 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8793282 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8793283 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8793284 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8793285 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8793286 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused
8793287 if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final
8793288 but i dont believe the question about an appeal has ever been raised
8793289 the events happened in new york and its a disadvantage to transfer everything here
8793290 when a guy has played as long as hasselbecks played or some other quarterbacks around the league have played youre not quite as concerned with your minutes in the preseason
8793291 then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8793292 what he needs to see is a comfort level of people falling around his feet
8793293 it will save the throws in his arm it will keep him fresh
8793294 i prepared really hard during the course of training camp and during the duration of the preseason i feel like im prepared and ready to go for next week
8793295 ive gotten better in terms of understanding the offense being more familiar with what were trying to do as a team and whats expected of the quarterback position
8793296 but we did some things well and we can build on it and get ready for next week
8793297 even if we planned to name a starter we couldnt right now
8793298 well find out more about kyle in the next couple of days we dont know about troy well see what the next few days bring
8793299 i dont think anybody would have thought this was going to happen a couple weeks ago i mean its pretty crazy for smith to get sick and something to happen to somebodys shoulder but ive done what ive been asked
8793300 i wouldnt be surprised if they said he was the starter hes played well hes done the things theyve asked him to do especially as a rookie guy
8793301 we were able to keep that football team out of the end zone that puts us 13 straight quarters without giving up an offensive touchdown
8793302 it was a game we felt we had to win
8793303 its a big win for us this was a great game
8793304 the perception is that everything has changed ive heard people say that hes trying to change the culture and thats not true at all
8793305 im embracing the culture are we running a new system as far as plays and maybe some different training methods sure
8793306 were still going to sing hail to the victors after games if we win
8793307 youre going to see the winged helmet running out of the spread its crazy
8793308 we have absolutely no idea what to expect from michigan this season especially on offense which makes this one of the most interesting seasons in my lifetime
8793309 its going to be so cool to see a michigan team running the spread it might take a few seasons but hes building a program that can compete with the sec and usc for the national title and especially a program that can beat ohio state i dont care that hes an outsider we probably needed an outsider to move the program in the right direction
8793310 one night in cedar point was all we could scrounge together we brought some bologna put it in the cooler but we had a good time on the demon drop
8793311 were going to be who are im a small town guy who cut my teeth coaching small college football
8793312 i havent asked what it was like before because i dont care my door is always open players never have an appointment to see the coach i want to have a bunch of coaches who like what theyre doing and crack a few jokes and have some fun i know its serious business but its not life and death no one likes winning more than me i can promise you that but there are things more important and thats why i have such a great job i get paid really good for doing a job thats a lot of fun
8793313 those who thought lloyd carr was too boring are psyched but with everything that happened this summer the traditional michigan fan is very very skittish
8793314 the impression that some people have is that hes not going to be on the up and up and now michigan could be like every other program
8793315 all the tough stuff is behind us and he can focus now on the program
8793316 sometimes its just heat of the moment if he sees something good he cusses if he sees something bad he cusses but you know when its good and bad hes just excited
8793317 do i curse at practice some too much yeah at times but im a lot better than i used to be i used to be worse
8793318 rodriguez is a young bo schembechler with a southern accent
8793319 usually we can watch film back to 96 on michigan and its the same stuff the same ideas
8793320 now youre just going to have a certain number of games to watch them on its a bigger challenge it makes the battle more exciting
8793321 it was just time for change because everyone kind of knew exactly what we were going to do
8793322 but that was the arrogance of being at michigan you know what they are going to run its up to you to stop them because our players are better than you
8793323 at first people were nervous because no one has been through it and they didnt know what to expect
8793324 its really a new chapter in the book a different chapter coach has brought in some things that were successful the thing that makes michigan michigan those things are still in place those who stay will be champions michigan will be michigan
8793325 its a highly competitive atmosphere and if you cant do that on a football field i think were kidding ourselves
8793326 were having a good time thats really all it is
8793327 its unfortunate that a couple of things that were caught by television cameras were blown way out of proportion
8793328 i dont think it looks good jawing with fans i will tone that down
8793329 i was not being derogatory to those colts fans i spent four quarters in the game and i felt like i knew them but it didnt come across great on tv and im the first to acknowledge that
8793330 philip made his mark to the world that hes the leader of this team
8793331 thats a quarterback who played on a torn acl not a defensive lineman a linebacker or a tight end
8793332 he earned new respect with his team and around the league
8793333 you have to be who you are its funny theres some quarterbacks who get a lot of heat in the nfl for not showing any emotion
8793334 the chargers are 25 7 with philip as the starter including 15 1 at home
8793335 he takes advantage of being with good players most of the great quarterbacks with that kind of record have that fortunate advantage
8793336 but if you wanted to write a manual about how to come back from acl surgery philip did that this offseason ive never seen anyone approach knee rehab the way he did with the time and energy he committed to getting back as quickly as he did
8793337 just to have an offseason with philip really helps my game and im looking forward to this season
8793338 hes a great guy to be around with a great personality i wish people could get to know him
8793339 people forget hes just a fifth year quarterback and hell be better and more mature this season
8793340 the best thing chris does for vincent is he drags a lot of attention away from him and there are a lot of open windows in cover 2 for a guy like vincent to make plays
8793341 a lot of defensive backs are taught run run and when you see the receivers hands go up get ready to chop down
8793342 if you want to get to that next level you have to really get to know one another chris and i have had a great offseason together

8793348 french speaking region of belgium that provides the gritty postindustrial landscape so omnipresent in many of their films
8793349 the dardenne brothers have confessed to a burden they believe in hope they insist that under the frenzy of our world physical and moral there is quiet
8793350 she hurtles through the film as if she would crash through a brick wall in search of a job
8793351 rather than personify or dramatize social forces arrayed against her this darwinian study suggests that rosettas oppression is rooted as much in her internalization of dog eat dog capitalism as in her unpitying environment
8793352 i t was pure chance jean pierre insists there was already a bill going through and the minister took advantage of our award to call it the rosetta law but we never intended to get laws changed luc adds of course we always hope our films will speak to people disturb them but we never hoped to change the world
8793353 for all its quasi documentary materialism the son is ultimately a christian allegory of one mans inchoate desire to return good for evil
8793354 it is hardly surprising that the dardennes put together their naturalist fable with such a fanatical self effacing sense of craft they are obsessed with work in the way that some of their european counterparts are obsessed with sex the textures and rhythms of manual labor are for them at once irreducibly physical and saturated with an almost spiritual significance
8793355 like the dardennes close framing and tracking their use of ambient light and sound the slow pacing is a way of clinging to the character and feeling the moral weight of his actions even when he does not thats why its possible to care about inept thoughtless bruno and care deeply when at last he too feels the gravity
8793356 its about a young woman who has every reason to be desperate and who continues to believe that everything is possible
8793357 what we do with the actors is also very physical the day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly the way they were rehearsed we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before the instructions we give the actors are above all physical we start working without the cameraman just the actors and my brother and me we walk them through the blocking first one then the other trying several different versions they say but do not act their lines we do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling at this point there is no cameraman no sound engineer no lighting then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot which is usually a long take doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors movements or any small details
8793358 the looseness of jennys script made me feel that this shouldnt be a tightly directed movie
8793359 at every step of the way jenny went to an unexpected place and went further and further off formula and never pulled back
8793360 theres terrible trauma in this family and yet the wedding is beautiful i wanted rachel getting married to explore both sides of that paradox the dark struggle and the celebration of love and family and friends
8793361 we all agreed to let reality happen in front of the cameras without trying to manipulate it from behind the scenes too much consistent with that we didnt do any rehearsals and nobody not even declan really knew what the shot was going to be until the take started taking shape
8793362 there would be the main characters in gut wrenching conversation and declan he was almost like one of the actors part crew and part cast relying on his instincts skill and confidence to know where to point the camera i like to say this movie has jonathans heartbeat and a lot of declans blood
8793363 the way we worked was very empowering to the cast and brought the emotions to the surface even the crew had to look at things differently because we all had to be on our toes and react in the moment as the dp i dont usually operate the camera myself but it gave me the freedom to make immediate choices i tried to see the action as a viewer in the room would to put the audience in the midst of it
8793364 since we never knew when the camera was on us the cast had to listen every second and achieve a very intense level of focus one of the lessons that the movie teaches particularly for people in recovery is how important it is to stay in the present to be able to stay in character and hear and react to the music and the scene around you is very liberating for an actor to me this story is about communication and love and we were given the latitude to explore that
8793365 something happens where you get to work and every corner of the house feels like a house and not a movie set
8793366 ive had this desire to try to provide the musical dimension of a movie without traditionally scored music i thought wait a minute in the script paul is a music industry bigwig sidneys a record producer many of his friends will be gifted musicians so of course there would be nonstop music at this gathering following that logic we have music playing live throughout the weekend but always in the next room out on the porch or in the garden
8793367 the musicians were encouraged to play whenever they were inspired to the more the better never paying attention to the rolling camera
8793368 anne hathaway was trying to act out a very intense scene while the musicians noodled around outside
8793369 storytelling that wasnt on the page as scripted my character paul and debra wingers character abby my ex wife hardly exchange any dialogue but debra and i followed our instincts and enlarged that relationship without words through gestures
8793370 there were things in the script that jenny had written in a very pared down style
8793371 at script level the wedding progressed through brief snapshot leaps in time
8793372 there are times when you feel like jonathans orchestrating everything and nothing at the same time
8793373 sometimes it seems like all hes doing is smiling and making sure people feel good about work day after day but he knows what hes after and gets what he wants
8793374 every person every face in the film is there for a reason
8793375 jonathan loves real people and loves working with his friends which creates a real camaraderie and ease we were really having a wedding i wasnt a producer i was a wedding planner and he invited his friends
8793376 people actually went home at night and saw their families
8793377 one of the conceits of the script was that despite the drama the wedding goes great
8793378 there are two different kinds of gatherings going on people gathering to have fun at the wedding and other people engaged collectively in the epic struggle against addiction gathering together to gain strength from that community on a parallel track we wanted to show maximum respect for that courage and honesty
8793379 and how direct she is her timing may not be appropriate but shes trying so hard to get across the chasm of tragedy that separates her from her family shes trying every day to choose joy and sobriety shes fighting for her place in the family trying to acknowledge and atone in her own way at the end maybe her sister rachel understands her journey and that acceptance is crucial
8793380 its meaningless even if shimane prefecture has proclaimed takeshima day after the japanese name for dokdo and even if the ministry of education culture sports science and technology has mentioned takeshima in teaching guidelines
8793381 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8793382 at the time i spoke korean in the interview i experienced pricks of conscience as i felt if the latest decision targets me ill pay more attention to improving my english
8793383 the prevailing atmosphere among korean golfers is that they should accept the lpgas decision and make more of an effort
8793384 we cannot give any name to russian troops other than occupation
8793385 russia is being ruled by former soviet security service agents who consider the end of the cold war as their defeat
8793386 its outrageous actions it would lead to the disintegration of russia itself
8793387 i think western pressure already put on russia has had its effect
8793388 it works and it will work because russia depends on the west its not the soviet union that was self sufficient
8793389 and so far only the terroristic organization hamas has supported russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia not a single state not even venezuela cuba so far they have not said anything in this regard
8793390 there is a lot for the world to learn from the united states their democratic process
8793391 here we have come to learn that the process is a lot more important than the outcome
8793392 we are continuing to have to cope with those challenges including how to ensure that our democracy remains credible in spite of the various interest groups and pressure groups that come together to try to achieve a particular result
8793393 so to that extent i think that the interaction has been very useful
8793394 but there is enormous solidarity between all the democratic movements here in this hemisphere and around the world nobody chooses giving up in regard to the problems democracy is facing in their countries
8793395 its very good its very transparent but i think we can improve on them and in fact ndi is bringing a team to have a look at where we can improve our system
8793396 regardless of your color your age your shape or size if you work hard and have a big dream america is a country that shows that you can realize your dream here
8793397 and that means a whole lot for the rest of the world its not just because of obama its for everybody

8793522 youve got all these deer eating up everything people are squawking about them eating their bushes and they lay around die out there cause diseases and everything
8793523 im a bow hunter i think its a good sport and i think its a viable way to control deer populations theyve been doing it at liberty and pretty boy for years no problems

8793535 just because they think they have the right to instead of pursuing whats in their shareholders best interests

8793541 i think it is time you stopped talking about the emerging church you havent lead a church in over two years your voice is irrelevant to the conversation since you are on the outside of it
8793542 i never thought id be single at this time of my life
8793543 and with that in mind i still want to work i still want to keep my hand in it

8793547 grains nuts dried fruit cereals and related items stored in the closet or pantry serve as food for its caterpillar
8793548 you are immediately struck by the enormity of this and the meticulousness of the records
8793549 thats the astounding part that they kept these records i guess that is part of their gestalt
8793550 it was a leap of faith because everything had changed
8793551 about two years ago i tried to gain access to it and could not

8793558 migraine is a mechanism that is built into the human brain we all possess it and it becomes active by an efficient build up of its triggers

8793560 the degree of symptoms depends on how high above the threshold your triggers are
8793561 the bottom line from my perspective is that its best to prevent it rather than to walk around with some expensive hardware to zap yourself every time you get an aura
8793562 that strong look though with women goes into a cat eye glasses
8793563 the frame has to be deep enough so we look for those frames but ones that are fashionable

8793590 probe of federal judge expands to include house sale to lawyer

8793623 we brought a proposed settlement to our client and the fire commission declined to recommend that settlement to the board of supervisors

8793627 an excellent wife who can find she is far more precious than jewels rubies
8793628 she considers a field and buys it with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard

8793630 she perceives that her merchandise is profitable her lamp does not go out at night
8793631 she makes linen garments and sells them she delivers sashes to the merchant
8793632 she opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy

8793634 strength and dignity are her clothing and she laughs at the time to come
8793635 she watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness

8793687 to bring to trial those who intentionally damaged property and provoked a disturbance of public order
8793688 asked relevant agencies to confiscate the whole acreage in dispute in dong da district for building public projects
8793689 this dispute has been going on for about 10 years but it exploded eight months ago here
8793690 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8793691 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8793692 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect and next week well also hear about those occasions when hes broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8793693 the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy senator mccain has been anything but independent
8793694 a nation of whiners tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who after they found out it was closing kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty these are not whiners they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint these are the americans that i know
8793695 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8793696 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
8793697 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now
8793698 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8793699 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend that promise is our greatest inheritance its a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night and a promise that you make to yours a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west a promise that led workers to picket lines and women to reach for the ballot

8793715 thursday night as he embarked on the final lap of his audacious bid to become the nations first black president
8793716 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8793717 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8793718 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8793719 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8793720 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8793721 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8793722 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent
8793723 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for

8793729 i would just like to remind everyone that this time last year we of course didnt have a peace process and perhaps its well to go back to when president george w bush came to office in 2001 in the midst of the breakdown completely of the peace process with the second intifada underway
8793730 i think that his position in dealing with the issues that are important to
8793731 comes from deeply held views that he has or lack of experience
8793732 this claim was verified to wnd by other diplomatic sources involved in the negotiations
8793733 black people have made much progress and history and for this i am pleased however there is no comparison between king and obama should be ashamed that he has disgraced mlks message with his filthy lies and terror associations

8793735 the decision was fiercely opposed by environmentalists including the nature and parks authoritys own science committee who fear the drilling will irrevocably damage the areas delicate ecosystem
8793736 no creo que al senador mccain no le importe lo que pasa en las vidas de los americanos sino que no lo sabe porque no lo entiende

8793752 i wonder if those of you who dont like the gloria storyline just dont like gloria and no matter what she was up to you probably wouldnt like it i respect your right not to like gloria and having said that i have to admit i realy like judith chapman so almost anything they have her do is pretty much ok with me as for the tainted cream affair if we can call it that i also wonder if the actual law is not what is keeping the show from doing anything about gloria first of all it was never proven that the woman who died died because of the tainted cream because she had a pre exsisting condition secondly gloria did not know this woman and so intent could never be proven since there was no intent to begin with the worse thing she could be charged with and maybe convicted because micheal would be her lawyer is sabotaging a product that is definetly illegal but its not murder and there is a possiblility she would get away with it because of extenuating circumstance the extenuating circumstances being that she never meant to have the tainted cream go out on the market of course this would have to be proven as tv court room drama goes this would make a tedious case at best and it is quite possible that she would never be charged because so many things couldnt be proven if justic is what you are all looking for i believe it has been served justice is not always handled in the courts gloria has lost 2 husbands all her money was thrown out of the abbot mansion is living in a pool house and has lost her job really how much more can they do to her i think she has payed i believe that the only thing that needs to happen now is for the writers to put this behind us and let us all get on with some new story lines i agree with all of you this is getting to be a very tired subject let us put an end to it
8793753 wasnt it jills son who was an alcoholic amp died in an auto crash i think thats what happened to him nina left with her son we dont hear anything about them i remember pauls mother being on the show when his son ricky was born amp after when paul amp christine were trying to get back together amp then she left about that time amp it was brought up that she had met someone amp i dont know what happened with that things get fuzzy here amp there age lol

8793758 used for nearly a decade in europe wooden key cards have proven to be equally durable to the traditional plastic key card but unlike plastic wood is a renewable and biodegradable resource
8793759 by switching plastic cards to biodegradable wood hotels and resorts can reduce plastic waste by 1 300 tons annually the amount of plastic waste that traditional hotel key cards generate in the u s alone the weight and density of this waste is equal to the volume of seven 777 airplanes
8793760 we do hope to produce prepaid gift cards in the near future
8793761 however we don t foresee entering the credit card market any time soon given the more delicate composition of the wood cards they simply won t hold up under repeated use like a plastic card

8793792 the offences for which our clients extradition is sought were committed on british soil and we maintain that any prosecution of our client ought therefore to be carried out by the appropriate british authorities
8793793 our client faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8793794 our clients case highlights a worrying trend where uk citizens are at the mercy of the ever increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country
8793795 it is a shame that the court of human rights will allow his extradition even as they consider whether us extradition measures were fair
8793796 i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion
8793797 i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8793798 when i found out we were going i started jumping up and down i was so excited
8793799 this is a huge historical moment world wide no matter how you look at it
8793800 i think what dr king said 45 years ago has come to fruition
8793801 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8793802 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8793803 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8793804 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8793805 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8793806 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8793807 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8793808 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
8793809 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism

8793812 i think the biggest thing is when youre confident you win even when you feel youre not playing well you see guys do it a lot thats the thing that just comes with matches and winning matches

8793815 my brother and i witnessed the instability of what our father did hed be working at a nightclub for a year then one evening we would say are you going to work tonight dad and he would say no were not playing there any more i remember thinking gosh this is tough i knew id have to get a real job when i grew up i didnt know what id do but it would have to involve carrying a briefcase and id definitely live in a house
8793816 i was placating myself i saw that as a more legitimate way to be an entertainer i understood later that i had wanted all along to try my hand at comedy but i was scared of the uncertainty sports broadcasting seemed like a more solid career less treacherous but as i got closer to graduating i knew i should try this thing
8793817 i got snl with a bit of a guilty conscience
8793818 i felt like a mouse who found this hunk of cheese that nobody else got
8793819 the other writers and i thought will was the straight man it wasnt until the first read through that i thought holy crap hes amazing he could do all these characters he was a great straight man and then he proved he could write the writing staff fell in love with him very early on
8793820 the cast was this really well adjusted group of people it wasnt the crazy drug addled snl of the 1970s and 1980s we had the advantage of seeing what fame had done to those people who had gone before the new intake was made up of anti celebrities who reacted against that excess i think people still respond to that in will he knows pompous big shots are ridiculous and that theres a hard fall waiting for them he has a pretty healthy outlook on the whole joke of wealth and fame and hollywood
8793821 i dont have this yearning to be respected or taken seriously but it does bother me that comedy isnt considered hard to do

8793833 the state department was the only agency that did not provide data for this study because it does not keep track of employees who have gone awol
8793834 there is currently no centralized human resources hr database or reporting process tied to the departments payroll system that tracks the number of cumulative agency awol hours
8793835 two departments in particular reported the problem was significantly worse than other agencies the department of veterans affairs va and the department of the treasury veterans affairs and treasury reported both the highest total number of awol hours as well as the highest number of hours per employee these measurements show va and treasury not only reported the highest total awol hours but that the two departments have the worst problem when size and number of employees are taken into account
8793836 missing from the homeland security data was awol information from employees of the transportation security administration tsa and the coast guard which accounts for a bulk of the departments awol hours when tsa information was reported for 2007 as part of the departmental totals awol hours at homeland security increased from approximately 100 000 hours per year to more than 800 000 hours per year it is not known if similar totals would be found for other years if complete homeland security department information was available

8793840 what really counts is that in moments of pain and suffering someone stays with us more important than any particular action or word of advice is the simple presence of someone who cares in a time so filled with methods and techniques designed to change people to influence their behavior and to make them do new things and think new thoughts we have lost the simple but difficult gift of being present to each other

8793873 be there for my dad the way he was for me
8793874 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market said ken hasegawa manager of the energy desk at newedge japan brokerage in tokyo
8793875 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant because of limited capacity
8793876 the environment of sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner he said

8793879 credit growth is actually slowing so the rba has actually achieved what it wanted to do by raising rates and slowing domestic demand and slowing the rate of domestic credit mr smirk said
8793880 now is the time to get out on the front foot
8793881 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8793882 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that ms deda said
8793883 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
8793884 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points mr oughton said
8793885 current economic turbulence and changes reinforce the importance of continued investment in our brands experience of our management and sound fiscal management chairman gerry harvey said today
8793886 within the 2009 financial year a minimum of 15 new complexes for our brands will open
8793887 the investment in and development of retail complexes is an essential component of our business strategy with current developments in the queensland victoria south australia western australia and new zealand
8793888 many times in fact over the last 50 years or so but were still around because we do the basics right
8793889 own the building wherever we can have low debt and give the customer a good shopping experience
8793890 weve increased our market share in the key areas flat panel tv technology products bedding and remain strong in the rest
8793891 our brands are market leaders in the core audio visual and technology segment the beijing olympics has reinforced our position mr harvey said
8793892 theres no change at this stage but that depends on journalists and if they put picket lines in place
8793893 we would expect our people not to cross a picket line
8793894 this protest rally is open to everyone in the community to come out and support high quality journalism at the age and to condemn the low cost low quality journalism that fairfax management wishes to impose
8793895 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action
8793896 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8793897 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8793898 the company has been putting out rumours to that effect for the last couple of weeks we were well aware that thats how they would try and get the papers out if we went on strike
8793899 we would urge people who work for rural press to just continue to do their normal work and to not come in and support fairfax at this time
8793900 but this company puts its employees in a terrible situation and gives them often little choice but to obey its directives its not clear these people are doing it willingly theyve clearly been directed by the company
8793901 its my understanding that mike was unprepared to write during the strike
8793902 this is an indication again that the new regime at fairfax media is embarking on a low quality approach to journalism
8793903 the management is prepared to trample on anyone who gets in their way and the people who will lose out in this case are the sydney morning herald readers
8793904 brutal said further bureau mergers and cuts were being considered
8793905 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8793906 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8793907 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaux of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaux
8793908 you can slim it down to one bureau in canberra covering everything but you end up diminishing the analysis of the democratic process and very seriously so
8793909 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not the part of the business that is being affected at all
8793910 its really quite mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
8793911 the best thing about this tournament is that it is just so amazingly diverse
8793912 its a real celebration of all different races and nationalities
8793913 the capital raising of up to approximately 430 million announced today will be used to recapitalise the companys balance sheet providing gunns with a robust balance sheet to support future growth executive chairman john gay said
8793914 time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8793915 w ere you in this campaign just for me or w ere you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8793916 belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8793917 the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
8793918 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8793919 i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8793920 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8793921 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8793922 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8793923 the craziest ones are the ones where were angry about something
8793924 like the audience not showing up which happened to us a lot early on thats when im smashing my amp into something or other or goading the audience
8793925 i got chucked out of our own gig in soho by some big bad ass russian dude
8793926 it starts as play fighting but can get out of hand
8793927 you have to keep god in your morals and let it guide you
8793928 everyone contradicts themselves theres the person you wanna be and the person you are
8793929 but we all have bad in us thats the struggle
8793930 i had two pairs of jeans so it was either wash them every night or go into school with grass stains
8793931 wed make plays like the crucifixion of jesus a sheet over a bunk bed was the tomb
8793932 things changed when i realised i could channel it through the group there was stress at school my mum was dating my football coach but when i played music i didnt need to think about all this stuff it was an escape
8793933 groups of rednecks shouting play some 70s music do some covers
8793934 the place erupted security came in to break up the situation and the people in the bar beat up the security
8793935 the police came to spray everyone with pepper spray but thats one of the nights i realised what we do could be very powerful
8793936 when we arrived we thought were going to crush the uk
8793937 so i took a whole wad of white putty and just made my head into a mass of shit
8793938 josh homme happened to be going past and he says you boys from kentucky really are fucked up
8793939 they are aircraft and types of accident that are not related to each other at all
8793940 the geographical split has become more extreme over the years
8793941 accidents in north america europe and asia with the exception of indonesia have become fantastically rare
8793942 i thought the whole match was very tough mentally and i thought i dealt with it pretty well
8793943 im very happy with the win hes got a huge serve and being a lefty makes it tougher hes definitely one of the top net players in the game hed give anyone a tough match very rarely does he lose easily to anyone
8793944 i said what needed to be said its not nice when you dont have confidence in the calls you just want to be able to play

8793946 absolute need for the reserve bank of australia rba to lower interest rates
8793947 there can be no further delay in respect to a drop in the official cash rate it said today
8793948 the weak result reflects a final bout of mortgage rate increases clashing with sharply higher fuel and food bills
8793949 budgeted sales levels are well down on expectations and that runs the clear risk of the next step being a shedding of labour in the industry mr dale said
8793950 the imminent move to lower interest rates is a welcome first step to a much needed home building recovery but the delay to a tangible boost to construction activity will be significant
8793951 but for sure we dont want him and were not going to have him
8793952 those movements carefully position the flys centre of mass relative to the jumping legs so that leg extension propels them away from the looming threat
8793953 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8793954 the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small changes in its posture to reach the correct pre flight stance
8793955 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8793956 i was loth to ask god to help me live
8793957 but eventually i said that if god would help me live i would tell the world about what happened to me and how it happened

8793971 the doctors say there is no cause for concern he just needs to rest
8793972 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8793973 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8793974 i told her she gave me my son back it was something i needed to say
8793975 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8793976 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a lack of evidence
8793977 after all this they are still my brothers i wish them the best
8793978 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat
8793979 i understand this as progress albeit just little by little
8793980 the japanese and chinese sides are cooperating in the investigations and exchanging information we are working to reach a conclusion as soon as possible
8793981 normally one would think so but were still in the midst of investigations
8793982 we agreed that japan and the united states will exchange information and closely coordinate with each other
8793983 we would like to keep a close eye on developments with a sense of vigilance
8793984 i am confident that the money has been used appropriately for political activities
8793985 i believe many people will be content once they see our disclosed report
8793986 i feel sorry for confusing the public and my supporters
8793987 he provided us with receipts covering about 80 to 90 percent of the office expenses and i believe he can give you a full account of almost every office activity that costs as little as one yen
8793988 is defined less by what the passengers see than by how they feel
8793989 youre putting people in a confined environment and controlling how theyll feel with the oxygen humidity and everything they touch and see it all has an effect
8793990 the degree of instability in the security situation has risen
8793991 i thought it was marvelous he laid out what he is going to do its not going to be easy but he is going to try
8793992 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8793993 he did a great job addressing the areas where he has been attacked patriotism his qualifications for the job and how he plans to pay for all his ideas
8793994 the over the top stadium show surrounding the speech might help motivate his supporters but it might be playing into the hands of his critics who try to paint him as a rock star with no substance
8793995 he described a chance to keep the american promise and he made a lot of promises he is the pied piper of promises
8793996 a government that is powerful enough to give you everything you want can take everything you have
8793997 he is scarier than former president bill clinton because he is arrogant and a true believer
8793998 it was a feel good speech it made you think about yourself and where you wanted the united states to go it was just him making you feel good for the purpose of him getting elected
8793999 there was great resonance with his criticism of the bush administration and mccains support for it
8794000 the challenges we face require tough choices we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for a hunter in rural ohio than those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit their loved ones in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination passions may fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8794001 when washington doesnt work its promises always seem empty i get it
8794002 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course its not a guarantee its only an opportunity the question facing us simply put is will we seize this opportunity for change thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity and some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8794003 what would you do if you could live your life again
8794004 i founded the company in 2005 in one of those
8794005 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together

8794011 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat
8794012 macular degeneration is a degeneration of the eye where in which the macula which is the center of the retina degenerates creating a blind spot in the center of your vision
8794013 the results of this study are that if you have a particular form of this gene you are more predisposed to this form of macular degeneration
8794014 now we have a drug target where we can potentially design drugs in the future to reverse the dry form of macular degeneration and for the people who are predisposed to macular degeneration maybe we can do preventative measures we can do to slow down progression
8794015 it has a cautionary note for the people who might be on rna based drugs that it might cause some damage to the macula
8794016 notable and now confirmed improvement to the citys financial position
8794017 i take what i do very seriously and i realize that i am the only transmitter of our culture that these kids get in the eighth grade year
8794018 my philosophy is to do the best that i can do every single day because my job is an important job
8794019 we do a lot more writing in class making sure that when the students are answering the question they show that they understand the question
8794020 im just one of the guys in the district doing the best i can there are other schools and other teachers in the district doing the same thing
8794021 its a lot of hard work by the grace of god and with good luck we passed the test next year it could be just the opposite because every year you have a new group of students taking the test and its not even the same test
8794022 dalton is a community that places a great deal of value on education
8794023 its easier for me to do the job i do because our parents take education with the same seriousness that i take when i teach their children
8794024 superman represents truth justice and the american way and those are all things that i believe in
8794025 we determined a just cause existed and that he had committed acts of misconduct unbecoming an officer and untruthfulness
8794026 those are serious rules violations that i believe warranted the recommendation of termination
8794027 we are not sure if he did it on his own or if others were involved with him
8794028 grossis mother doesnt believe it theres certainly a question about that
8794029 when we got there the situation was calm and there were no arrests
8794030 neighbors have said they could hear fighting between the two
8794031 burning houses of innocent villagers looting of villages abandoned by people they forced to leave at gunpoint robbing people of their farm animals and other valuables whenever they occupy supposedly peaceful communities are acts of terrorism
8794032 we offer this prayer as one nation and in solidarity with the mindanao bishops as well as the thousands of innocent people who are forced to evacuate and live in uncertainty and fear because of the current crisis and war
8794033 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especially at the ramadan time said quevedo who is also the secretary general of the federation of asian bishops conferences gmanews tv

8794035 the government will not sign the moa in its present form and in any other form
8794036 it is a very significant change in the position of the government
8794037 it moa has been set aside but not the peace process
8794038 klaro ang desisyon ng ating gobyerno diyan whatever the decision will be hindi natin pipirmahan ang moa na yan dahil may mga issues nga na dapat pang titignan ng maayos
8794039 we can no longer hold onto an asset of that value in the hope that someones going to come along and say hey the farms perfect
8794040 this is our one opportunity to get a big chunk of capital improvement cash
8794041 its certainly one of the things that needs to be looked at
8794042 a piece of ground like that property like that that was once needed for a specific purpose is no longer needed for that purpose i certainly dont blame them it needs developed
8794043 if they do sell it it would be something advantageous for navarre
8794044 theres one thing i dont want it to be theyve talked about selling it for a gravel pit but i hope they sell it to someone who has interest in developing it into something thats going to help the whole area
8794045 any job youve got on it would be an increase
8794046 generally classes are being held repair and rehabilitation works should proceed promptly so as to minimize disruption in classes
8794047 the real danger for the government is that with the 10p rebellion in which you kindly said i led the leading was merely putting on to the circuit an email and the response was automatic and overwhelming by
8794048 now the lesson the government ought to draw from that is that when it comes to protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our community while the government obviously shares backbenchers concerns about this they do now have a group of backbenchers who are prepared to take the government right to the line to ensure that a package is delivered
8794049 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff

8794051 lyon will be a hurdle to overcome fiorentina has its attraction because of luca toni it will no doubt be a very exciting affair
8794052 this is a group no one should underestimate and the match against fiorentina will be delicate for luca toni
8794053 i would not have prefered to play against a big club like chelsea manchester or arsenal its good to play lyon from my own experience i know what they are like
8794054 i would be a liar if i said we could not solve this task
8794055 we are happy even if the group does not appear spectacular on the first view it is interesting inter milan is a big challenge and the greeks can be very hard to beat our fans will experience a first against famagusta so the group is not without its attractions
8794056 i scored 19 goals without playing well last season so i hope to get much more this season and not pick up injuries
8794057 talent is important but you need to put the effort in first
8794058 we want a solid balanced barcelona team this season that wins games with football that entertains the fans
8794059 i love the atmosphere within this group and the ambition to win titles again
8794060 everything comes from the coach he lives and breathes football as an ex player and gives out important advice
8794061 ronaldinho is back he is a phenomenon he will have a great year in italy and he will make milan great again
8794062 with him and kaka here i feel we can win the scudetto
8794063 at the 2006 world cup we didnt do well together for different reasons
8794064 but on other occasions we have proved we can play well together i firmly believe that we will be even better with pato the three of us could be really effective together
8794065 ronaldinho will do extraordinary things at milan he is only 28 and is a great champion
8794066 he wont have any trouble adapting to serie a and he will get back to his best at the san siro
8794067 i am ready and i want to play against bologna
8794068 milan will win the scudetto we have the best weapons to win and deep down inside we feel were the favourites
8794069 against portsmouth i think everyone sat up and took notice of that and wigan was one where we had to dig in a bit more against a very physical team who i think will cause a lot of problems for teams at home this year i think its important to take a lot from both games not every game in the premier league is easy to play great flowing football in
8794070 against portsmouth he scored a great goal and then the free kick he hit the other day at wigan was a match winning moment its what you want players like him in your team for i expect more of the same from him
8794071 you can never say that you are a first choice at this football club
8794072 if you start to think like that then you can just about guarantee that you are about to lose your place its a big fight to get into the team its a bigger fight to stay there
8794073 of course we have to win things that is the main objective to win something this year
8794074 but if we can do it the way we play it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and thats what we are doing at arsenal
8794075 fulham showed us last weekend that you have to be up for every game game after game because english football is so different from any other football in europe that was a big blow and we will learn from it and hopefully it wont happen again
8794076 what happened last saturday was not arsenal and we needed to show it could not happen again
8794077 you take in the criticism but the key is that we knew that we were rubbish and that we could have done so much better now we need to show our real selves and we did well against twente
8794078 we knew that we did not put in the needed performance at fulham
8794079 but what happens in between games is not so important the crucial thing is to respond well in the next game which we did now we have another big game against newcastle and we need another response to what has happened before
8794080 michael is a very special player he is very important to this club and my vision for it
8794081 how many teams will beat manchester united and chelsea this year
8794082 i dont think theyll lose more than three games each without being a silly optimist how many points would you expect us to get from these opening three games
8794083 we took one point from them last season and that point was against manchester united when we got absolutely battered in the second half we played better against them this season and lost 1 0
8794084 it would be nice to get a point or three points up at everton but if youve got any brains how many points did people expect us to get from our first three games nine i dont think so unless youre an idiot

8794087 if you must judge a man do it by the people he surrounds himself with
8794088 brian cork is the perfect example of the cultural architect and entrepreneur he is bold and resourceful balanced by a keen sense of integrity and a desire to excel
8794089 with some reservations but mostly with conviction i use the word
8794090 the faith is that despite some of the more debilitating teachings of culture itself something can be done in school that will
8794091 what is relentless is our education which for good or ill gives us no rest
8794092 stop what youre doing or youre going to find yourself dead
8794093 the incredible feeling of betrayal from my colleagues id worked with these people for years
8794094 it is a spiritual crisis it is a psychological breakdown
8794095 what shocked the hong kong policeman was that the triad member had phoned someone in the canadian immigration ministers office in ottawa
8794096 the officer commented with that kind of relationship youve got a really serious problem
8794097 to see this 45 years later this is something a lot of us dreamt of but never thought wed see
8794098 im so full of pride we arent judging this man by the color of his skin but by the content of his character thats what dr king stood for
8794099 this is historic he is good for this country we need change and we couldnt have picked a better person
8794100 theres still a lot of work to be done but at least were on the right track
8794101 there are 75 000 people clamoring for tickets to obamas speech
8794102 john mccain cant give tickets away in dayton for a 15 000 seat arena thats how much excitement this obama campaign has

8794108 its going to have thick red and white stripes for a big top heritage look
8794109 how to call where to call or what to say
8794110 he simply doesnt have the integrity in my view unless he can somehow change that
8794111 its crucial because without it we wouldnt have been able to continue to participate in the air new zealand cup
8794112 it certainly means we can get on and focus on the competition but we still have our other battles ahead of us
8794113 effectively the nzru will be paying for the players payments
8794114 we dont want the competition to be disrupted and tasman withdrawing could have impacted on other provincial unions
8794115 im always doing something and im always on the go i hate being sick in bed
8794116 we believe we have found a good amount of equipment that is used for manufacturing methamphetamine two people a male and a female will be interviewed about that and we will be doing a scene examination at the wakefield address
8794117 well be interviewing all the people related to the addresses and see what comes out of that
8794118 i havent seen anything going on although over the last two days theres been a few cars coming and going late at night
8794119 so when we are dealing with these sorts of things we make sure its covered
8794120 als opperbevelhebber van het leger zal ik nooit aarzelen om dit land te verdedigen
8794121 maar ik zal onze soldaten enkel op een levensgevaarlijke missie sturen als die missie duidelijk is
8794122 door hard te werken en door offers te brengen kan ieder van ons zijn droom bereiken en zich aansluiten bij de grote amerikaanse familie om te maken dat ook de leden van de volgende generatie op hun beurt hun dromen kunnen waarmaken
8794123 ik denk niet dat john mccain weet wat er in het leven van de gewone amerikaan gebeurt

8794126 consistency is possibly the most important part of an exercise program even if you use the best exercise program in existence i e crossfit and give 100 effort when you work out if youre only doing it once a month it will have little effect on your overall health and fitness additionally you must have consistency before intensity if you are not consistent enough to get to the point where you can add intensity you are really missing out on results
8794127 id never heard that before but its good to know
8794128 i just have a million people who want to get on the plane and fly out with us
8794129 how about that theyre excited we know this we know the people in ohio are first class just like the valdosta ga people and we had a great experience there our guys know that theyre in for a treat just the whole atmosphere and aura of this whole thing is why people love football really its just excitement
8794130 i personally think that ohio is the hotbed of football
8794131 now youve got it all we want what you guys have were a little slow out here but were getting there believe it or not
8794132 he got a penalty on him for spiking the ball in the end zone
8794133 and that penalized us on a kickoff and the kicker kicked it out of bounds
8794134 if we dont get a lineman down field on another one we have another touchdown
8794135 they really did play well but still made some blocking mistakes that i would attribute to it as well we just had some missed assignments on the offensive line a couple of our young guys who have not been seasoned veterans if you will we did compete and that was encouraging
8794136 the kid is a dual threat to run and pass and anytime you have that in our offense thats a huge advantage
8794137 we expected him to make some mistakes but he can control the one that was probably the biggest most glaring one which was spiking the ball after he scored the touchdown hes kind of an emotional kid
8794138 its just a young mistake that he can correct and he can control that thats good if i said oh geez the kid cant throw 10 yards then we have a problem we can correct this
8794139 i thought they did a lot of good things but they can get better our o line coach is trying to make sure of that this week we did have some missed assignments
8794140 our whole secondary had never played in a varsity football game
8794141 hopefully we can speed that up they just need varsity reps
8794142 we are planning for our convention to open on monday
8794143 like all americans we are monitoring the situation closely in the gulf
8794144 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
8794145 there are a few things id like to change we got into a rhythm and i didnt want to come out of the game
8794146 hopefully in these next few days we can heal up
8794147 everyone knows were pretty banged up it will be nice to get some rest and get all our guys back and be 100 percent for dallas
8794148 the plan was to get a couple of three and outs and then take the players out but it didnt turn out that way we didnt play well believe me if we could put our finger on it we would have done something about it before now weve got a little bit more time to get it right
8794149 we havent played well that is all you can say about it we have not made all the effort we need to play well all the things that go into playing well we havent done once we get all our guys going i feel we will have a very strong defense
8794150 we would have liked to have a touchdown on that first one which was a little upsetting
8794151 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8794152 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8794153 now up is oksana chusovitina from germany and uh say is um that a woman

8794158 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course
8794159 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8794160 i also like fiorentina but everyone will finish behind us inter are still the best
8794161 hes the most complete coach ive ever had on the pitch and off it
8794162 hes meticulous about every little detail with us and it seems also with journalists
8794163 i heard him talking when he was at chelsea and after one and a half months of knowing him ive only positive things to say you can see straight away the difference to other coaches now theres a new spirit the team has more confidence in itself
8794164 it was one of the most exhilarating things you could ever witness
8794165 this is one of the greatest moments of my life
8794166 its like a dream come true that you never thought within our lifetime
8794167 tears of joy just fell from my eyes i couldnt help but cry it was one of the most tremendous moments of all my life i never thought i would live to see this come to pass and of course today the anniversary of that speech has a great meaning for me
8794168 how america felt when neil armstrong set foot on the moon you never thought wed get to that point in that time and everyone in the world felt that moment of triumph of success and thats what senator obamas candidacy means on the forty fifth anniversary of the march on washington
8794169 lets go to work now and make something happen that will show god we appreciate what hes done and to show those who suffered bled and died that we are grateful for what has happened to us
8794170 weve got to work together as brothers and sisters or were going to die apart as fools
8794171 its hard it really is and i know i shouldnt say this but im going to say it the missing persons bureau didnt do anything i called the mayors citizen hotline and thats the only way we got action
8794172 shed been missing for six days it dont make sense
8794173 we are going to look at our city watch policy again
8794174 mike i was wondering if you would be interested in putting your comic at the table to
8794175 everyone was riding so well especially robbie walker from australia he front boarded through that kink middle rail thats such a gnarly kink
8794176 the level of riding was ridiculous i was trying as hard as i could not to look ridiculous riding with those guys those two are the best two riders around at the moment
8794177 it was fun but cold tonight and it was a crazy level of riding
8794178 i feel like ive been run over by a semi
8794179 to the truly engaged work and play are one and the same
8794180 publicize promote and attract investments for the singapore kunming rail link in early 2009
8794181 the doctors say there is no cause for concern he just needs to rest
8794182 if that were our intent we would not be working as feverishly as we are weve been going down a lot of avenues to emerge from bankruptcy
8794183 plz post a big fat code sign in before you can post messages
8794184 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness
8794185 there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8794186 we are aware of the reports and we are looking at what can be done to identify the remains and establish whether they are of an australian and if they date back to the second world war
8794187 its too early to speculate on the nationality of the airman or the circumstances of his death there were allied australian and american and japanese airmen who would have been flying over the area in the war
8794188 a number of allied aircraft had been reported as missing in the area in particular b25 mitchells and a number of kittyhawk aircraft
8794189 i thought it was marvelous he laid out what he is going to do its not going to be easy but he is going to try
8794190 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8794191 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8794192 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8794193 i know last year some games got started later because of some overtime
8794194 were going to schedule our departure well be ready to go but well have people washington high athletic director tim ridgleys going to be at the game and we wont leave until the end of the third quarter of that third game
8794195 if anybodys getting worried that were not showing up there we are we just dont want our kids sitting around at fawcett stadium on a bus because they cant get into the locker room
8794196 but dont tell leach this but leach gets too much credit my offensive coordinator eric kjar he played at wayne state in nebraska and they ran this same offense all weve done is kind of supplement the offense with what leach did and what urban meyer the former university of utah coach did at florida weve kind of supplemented that
8794197 but the expectations dont go down any many thought that this would be a rebuilding year jackson and were hoping not
8794198 were going through a period right now where we dont know if it will hold
8794199 we try to stay involved in our youth program but there are more and more sports coming up other sports are getting more active at a younger age and were losing a bit there we hope to keep building with the help of coaches and girls will get back in the community and build the future
8794200 we offer camps and clinics and the high schools girls usually get involved with those camps and clinics
8794201 we try to build a family orientation here we really only have 80 100 kids in our youth program and 95 percent of those girls that stick with that youth program will be our varsity
8794202 if you have a class willing to push each other and are committed then yeah well be successful with the help of staff and parents this is what we can do and hopefully we can continue to produce players that play at a high level
8794203 we were fortunate enough to win 15 federal league titles in a row but it gets a little more challenging and more competitive every year we want to make sure were prepared and focused for every game
8794204 it would definitely be a big step forward for us
8794205 the last of a line of lasts the pale princess of a palace cracked
8794206 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because republican presidential candidate mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8794207 we love al gore we believe he was cheated in the 2000 election and that he would have been a great president
8794208 were proud that he keeps on serving this country and the world
8794209 kaninang 9 a m we officially disseminated sa media sa lahat at family members as approved by me na wala talagang posibleng survivor at 9 a m today we officially disseminated to the media and to the family members that there is no possible survivor from the crash
8794210 you know i shouldve said africas new leaders i mean us
8794211 its a tool available to us to reduce the incidence of damage within the cbd and other public order offences such as assaults
8794212 unfortunately the actions of a few have meant that weve had to introduce laws that affect everyone
8794213 anyone found consuming alcohol would be given a warning with an offer put to them to tip it out
8794214 if they continue to consume then we have the power to arrest them
8794215 we were different to a lot of places the whole township was covered by the alcohol free zone including streets and public places but not parks as they were covered by a different legislation
8794216 it would appear that we dont have a problem of street drinking and i know in the past it has assisted police in carrying out their duties and we dont have any opposition to it
8794217 that means people who will be out of their council area interstate or overseas on election day should arrange for a postal or pre poll vote so they can exercise their democratic right and to also avoid a fine for not voting
8794218 apex australia is the oldest truly australian made volunteer organisation and i feel very privileged to be leading a great organisation into a bright future
8794219 the apex foundation developed in the late 1970s continues to invest in these charities with a corpus of over 10m and is the legacy that exists to continue the great work of apexians
8794220 apex clubs throughout australia continue to develop members life skills while contributing enormously to many communities throughout the country
8794221 i am very honoured to be leading this great australian made organisation into the future and pledge the commitment of all apexians in creating a better future for all australians
8794222 all work and no play make jack a dull boy
8794223 and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us
8794224 i think you reserve impeachment for grave grave breaches and intentional breaches of the presidents authority
8794225 i believe if we began impeachment proceedings we will be engulfed in more of the politics that has made washington dysfunction
8794226 we would once again rather than attending to the peoples business be engaged in a tit for tat back and forth non stop circus
8794227 a tit for tat back and forth non stop circus
8794228 my grandmother worked so hard my mother worked so hard

8794232 it is proposed that section 3 article xi of the constitution of this state be amended to read
8794233 section 3 the general assembly shall provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free public schools open to all children in the state and shall establish organize and support such other public institutions of learning as may be desirable that will provide a high quality education allowing each student to reach his highest potential
8794234 derbies are always good to play in the preparation is a little special
8794235 we are going to saint etienne to play and try to win the two teams will be motivated
8794236 we will have to be careful against the greens because the have not had a good start to the season
8794237 i think the team has made great progress it is important to preserve this stability
8794238 im not worried we have to get over this tiredness if there is one game i dont want to lose its this one on saturday
8794239 we feel the team is getting stronger its not perfect but we are working hard to maximise our form
8794240 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8794241 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8794242 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain
8794243 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8794244 from the temple grounds barack obama will outline an agenda for america that includes raising taxes increasing spending putting government bureaucrats in charge of health care and isolating america from the benefits of the global economy
8794245 while barack obama will talk about his plans to tax the rich and cut taxes on the middle class he will not say that his record includes voting for higher taxes 94 times and voting for a tax increase on those making just 42 000 per year
8794246 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8794247 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8794248 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8794249 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families
8794250 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8794251 and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8794252 talked loosely about the same old democratic solutions that have failed
8794253 i was rubbing his neck he likes to be rubbed there and then i looked at my hand and there was foam on there
8794254 they said that they didnt think it was enough of an exposure that it had to go into an open wound
8794255 what upsets me is everybody keeps telling me most likely shell be ok
8794256 i either get the shots and know im ok or i dont get the shots and worry
8794257 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8794258 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8794259 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8794260 i cant enjoy my neighborhood without having to fear for my life
8794261 my wife refuses to leave the house because she is so traumatized
8794262 then out of nowhere they started running toward us both dogs were able to travel about 80 feet in a matter of seconds
8794263 what really blew my mind was that those dogs walked up to my neighbor so calm that she started to pet them
8794264 one second they were running at me with their teeth bared and the next second they were trotting over to my neighbor it was as if the switch was turned off
8794265 the bottom line is that it is an issue of property rights and animal ownership versus the value of a human life
8794266 i think its ridiculous that the city does not consider this a top priority
8794267 in mr bridges situation no injuries were suffered and an officer did not witness the event all we can really do is record the dogs as at large without having to issue a citation
8794268 when compared to the estimated 260 000 population in plano thats a relatively small number of bites
8794269 regardless the current city ordinances require more than just aggressive barking and growling to have serious consequences for the owner
8794270 but it really boils down to the owners responsibility and what precautions the owner will take to prevent a similar situation
8794271 unfortunately some people dont want to accept that responsibility so we are picking up stray animals everyday
8794272 i am sympathetic to mr bridges in regards to this traumatic event
8794273 i understand why he wants more stringent rules regarding animal restraint laws but there is a fine line between balancing strict consequences to address the irresponsible pet owners and at the same time loose enough to not make someone jump through hoops if they want to have a pet in plano
8794274 i want to take this as high up the totem pole as i can
8794275 pet owners need to be responsible and suffer the consequences if they are not it is the citys and the states responsibility to ensure the safety of their citizens by strengthening those rules and consequences
8794276 i am willing to listen to anything that a citizen has to say and mr bridges has a valid point on public safety
8794277 hopefully ill be able to speak further with mr bridges and find support from the other council members
8794278 its too early to guess or second guess what another council member thinks about the action plan that i suggested mr bridges to formulate
8794279 we are definitely taking his statement into account if we are to make any changes to the current ordinances
8794280 moreover here i could get that most was looked for and most quick selling wow really stable and accurate of the information
8794281 ketika kesulitan mendatangimu bagaimana kau menghadapinya apakah kamu wortel telur atau kopi
8794282 lets join kapi a divine mission with a noble purpose worth spending for
8794283 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8794284 that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family
8794285 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich
8794286 we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
8794287 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8794288 that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8794289 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8794290 this works by using the bodys natural processes the reason the tattoo stays there is that a coating is put around the link to protect it from the bodys immune response
8794291 but this cream makes the ink identifiable to the body so that it realises the ink is there and starts rejecting it and healing itself
8794292 the effects of time frames on personal savings estimates savings behavior and financial decision making
8794293 no one has been spared from these criminals who strip wires from utilities vandalize fire hydrants steal manhole covers destroy agricultural equipment remove guardrails the list goes on and on
8794294 his wife is a radiologist or some specialist and they were looking for a hospital where they could both practice
8794295 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8794296 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8794297 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8794298 we are united to do all we can to protect our children
8794299 in the old days we could lock our doors and windows to protect our children now sexual predators come electronically into our homes
8794300 an absolute connection between people who molest children and create and distribute child pornography
8794301 that stuff should have been found and because it hasnt been maybe were searching the wrong area
8794302 people shy away from getting their prescriptions filled because theyve got to put food on the table
8794303 we chose to get the girls teeth taken care of first
8794304 i think i can still contribute something useful to the board
8794305 sorry its taking so long but the dessert was he realized what he was about to say and kind of mumbled under his breath frozen
8794306 most people probably wouldnt know it was me if you called me jeff
8794307 america needs a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8794308 look at me im the nice guy i said good job
8794309 art is patriotic a look at art and politics as the twin cities prepare to host the republican national convention
8794310 the united states has done more for the cause of christianity than the most powerful nations of christendom have done for ages
8794311 america needs a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8794312 look at me im the nice guy i said good job
8794313 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8794314 we have to respect his decision he was free to do what he wanted and it is a shame that he will not be joining us because he is a player that would have improved what is already a great team
8794315 but we have a superb side to start the league with and to play for all the aims that we have
8794316 madrids style of play is very much like the dutch national team where we like to attack and score goals
8794317 he has trained well with bayern and he could make an appearance
8794318 he is fast dangerous in front of goal and has great vision
8794319 what are we marching for stop the torture stop the war
8794320 what were hoping for is to have some kind of contact with the 75 000 people who are going in there to hear obama
8794321 care about ending the occupation not in 16 months not in ten years but now
8794322 i dont believe obamas message of change he is just more of the same stuff
8794323 the over prescription of antipsychotics is a serious breach of human rights these drugs should only be a last resort
8794324 the forthcoming national dementia strategy is a crucial opportunity to stop this dangerous over prescribing and we look forward to its launch in the autumn
8794325 this study should remind us all that antipsychotics are powerful drugs which can both be essential for some people while carrying other risks
8794326 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8794327 the findings in this report will aid public health and emergency preparedness efforts and may help reduce the mortality burden in future natural disasters
8794328 the finding that metastatic disease can arise from untransformed mammary cells in the circulation refines our conception of cancer progression
8794329 learning more about the spread of cancer or metastasis is essential because its harder to treat the disease once it has spread
8794330 the one thing that unites all human beings regardless of age gender religion economic status or ethnic background is that deep down inside we all believe that we are above average drivers
8794331 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8794332 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8794333 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8794334 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8794335 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8794336 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8794337 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8794338 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8794339 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused
8794340 if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final
8794341 but i dont believe the question about an appeal has ever been raised
8794342 if you have this product do not use it for your baby
8794343 it loosened enough so that the bars were actually exposed
8794344 the gap between the bars was wide enough so that the baby could slip through except for their head and so it was hung basically
8794345 the products in question were manufactured and distributed by simplicity inc a company that is no longer in business sfca purchased simplicitys assets at auction and has no legal liability for any products distributed previously by simplicity
8794346 you want to look for one that has solid sides so you dont have this issue with fabric coming loose you want to look for one thats sturdy
8794347 its sad that they dont realize somethings flawed until an accident happens
8794348 thats why you have to keep on the ball reading reviews its horribly tragic and i cant even fathom something happening to these little guys
8794349 sorry its taking so long but the dessert was he realized what he was about to say and kind of mumbled under his breath frozen
8794350 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8794351 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8794352 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8794353 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8794354 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8794355 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8794356 the competition between the pirates and the ninjas is so huge that battles are breaking out all over
8794357 were happy to bring this grand conflict to the wii and give players the chance to help determine who the ultimate champions are
8794358 ya allah tolong abaikan puasa ummat muhammad apabila sebelum memasuki bulan ramadhan dia tidak melakukan hal hal yang berikut tidak memohon maaf terlebih dahulu kepada kedua orang tuanya jika masih ada tidak bermaafan terlebih dahulu antara suami isteri tidak bermaafan terlebih dahulu dengan orang orang sekitarnya
8794359 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8794360 were only receiving the animals that were already up for adoption
8794361 the strays are going to other shelters in other parts of louisiana
8794362 state officials will release information on multiple pet shelters that will be established throughout the state
8794363 the pet shelters will be adjacent to human shelters and the pet owners will be required to be with and care for their pets
8794364 first of all youre not going to get 20 dogs to bark at the same time
8794365 if i could do that i could get them to shut up
8794366 they should make those concerns immediately available to planning staff
8794367 at the very least they could be able to guide them with what steps they could take next
8794368 we want this to be a very unique upscale kennel
8794369 its really hard when the towns not telling us whats an acceptable decibel
8794370 ill give you what you want but you got to tell me what you want
8794371 she just loves animals and has a gift with them
8794372 im not going to tailor it to one block because theres more than one pig in town
8794373 my husband and i are in our mid 80s and may have to sell our house at some time in the future
8794374 we may have a problem selling it with the pig next door
8794375 if you dont like it dont stand there and stare
8794376 that was a way of life out on the farm
8794377 if we owe it we owe it but it is not pleasant to get a bill that high later on
8794378 what weve done is taken the average of what normal consumption is divide it by two and bill it at that volumetric charge tier
8794379 i have people telling my staff were a bunch of nazis and that our offices ought to be firebombed
8794380 it is not that liberals do not know anything it is that they know so many things that are not so
8794381 the obama campaign signaled a willingness on thursday to say that the 2007 minneapolis bridge collapse raised management questions for minnesota gov tim pawlenty r while also maintaining that the populist argument it is building against john mccain will continue even if the presumptive republican nominee taps the son of a truck driver as his running mate
8794382 liberty is always dangerous but it is the safest thing we have
8794383 america needs a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8794384 look at me im the nice guy i said good job
8794385 in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for as for me i rejoice that i am not a republican
8794386 presidential hopeful john mccain who has been dogged for years by questions about his volcanic temper erupted in an angry profanity laced tirade at a fellow republican senator sources told the post yesterday
8794387 i guess it was bound to happen governor bushs campaign is getting desperate with a negative ad about me the fact is ill use the surplus money to fix social security cut your taxes and pay down the debt governor bush uses all of the surplus for tax cuts with not one new penny for social security or the debt his ad twists the truth like clinton were all pretty tired of that as president ill be conservative and always tell you the truth no matter what
8794388 senators are not used to having their intelligence or integrity challenged by another senator
8794389 in january 1995 mccain was midway through an opening statement at a senate armed services committee hearing when chairman strom thurmond asked is the senator about through mccain glared at thurmond thanked him for his courtesy translation buzz off and continued on mccain later confronted thurmond on the senate floor a scuffle ensued and the two didnt part friends
8794390 it escalated when mccain reiterated the charges oct 10 in a cross examination calling mcconnells actions the most egregious incident demonstrating the appearance of corruption he has ever seen in his senate career
8794391 unfortunately governor bush is a pat robertson republican who will lose to al gore the political tactics of division and slander are not our values they are corrupting influences on religion and politics and those who practice them in the name of religion or in the name of the republican party or in the name of america shame our faith our party and our country neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches of american politics and the agents of intolerance whether they be louis farrakhan or al sharpton on the left or pat robertson or jerry falwell on the right
8794392 the president listened too much to the vice president of course the president bears the ultimate responsibility but he was very badly served by both the vice president and most of all the secretary of defense
8794393 it was election night 1986 and john mccain had just been elected to the u
8794394 mccain noted his propensity for passion but insisted that he doesnt insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like that this is quite simply hogwash mccain often insults people and flies off the handle there have been the many times mccain has called reporters liars and idiots when they have had the audacity to ask him unpleasant but pertinent questions mccain once publicly abused sen richard shelby of alabama
8794395 we will do our utmost to make ajax champions again
8794396 i looked at the fixtures and noticed straight away that west ham away was the third game in
8794397 the trip to upton park was the one that stood out to me for some reason i cant think why not long ago i was looking at the fixtures and thinking about darlington and rochdale no disrespect to them now here i am looking at when we are going to be playing against manchester united and chelsea and west ham of course
8794398 its a reality that indoor cats get out all the time
8794399 at least indoor outdoor cats have some street smarts these indoor guys dont many of these indoor only cats are overweight theyre not in shape to get away from predators or cars if they do wind up at a shelter without a microchip they likely will never be recovered
8794400 people want to do the right thing awareness really can make a difference
8794401 i wish i could heal the hole in your heart
8794402 im planning to run for governor of alabama i have to live there for seven years i bought my house there last year i have homes in arizona and pennsylvania but alabama needs more help
8794403 since tests havent begun yet we dont know what the ailment is medical tests will begin on friday
8794404 comes every six months for a routine checkup around a month ago a checkup was conducted and he was in perfect health there is no cause for concern
8794405 when i first spoke out i clearly stated that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina after a recent phone call from lindsay while she was traveling on one of samanthas dj gigs i became very concerned
8794406 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8794407 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8794408 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8794409 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8794410 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana

8794412 investigators in bridge collapse focus on chilling video by jon hilkevitch tribune transportation reporter 9 41 pm cdt august 2 2007
8794413 the bridge must have been near a state of collapse for some time and the construction might have contributed to its failure
8794414 bazant said he suspects there may have been a hairline crack or fatigue in the steel joints near bridge supports leading to the buckling
8794415 ive shut up about this long enough samantha is using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some dj and now shes writing a book lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are
8794416 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse sam is using my daughter my daughter isnt working because shes always with sam even my ex wife dina knows it she just isnt doing anything about it
8794417 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8794418 alah nggak usah dipikirkan soekarno saja malah sampai bersumpah demi allah saat berjanji memberikan kebebasan menjalankan syariat islam di aceh tapi kemudian mengingkarinya
8794419 some of them were decapitated some did not have a hand each body was photographed
8794420 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8794421 baby seat laws did park dedications and hand out little league trophies to children that is what
8794422 but im equally excited about the opportunity this presents for me
8794423 i loved working with passionate people doing exciting work all over the country and it was thrilling when i could help them secure needed funding but the nature of the work and the sometimes brutal deadlines made it hard to make community commitments
8794424 once i started doing non profit work i was completely hooked to come to work every day and know that what i am doing will change peoples lives for the better is an amazing way to spend my time
8794425 i would be surprised to find anyone in brown county who has not been impacted by united way or one of our partner organizations
8794426 when my son was younger and first diagnosed with autism a united way helped fund the organization that literally changed my life its an amazing international organization and im honored to help move its mission forward
8794427 if we ever forget that were one nation under god then we will be a nation gone under

8794429 i think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty but leading them or
8794430 the federal government must stop spending money we do not have and borrowing to make up the difference

8794434 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
8794435 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
8794436 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
8794437 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
8794438 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
8794439 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
8794440 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air

8794445 on 7 august at 14 42 the georgian peacekeepers left the headquarters of the peacekeeping forces under the pretext that theyd received orders from their commanders to leave their posts and they never returned one hour later heavy artillery shelling began at 22 35 a massive bombardment of tsklhinval started at 22 50 the transfer of georgian ground troops started to the combat area at the same time georgian field hospitals were set up and at 23 30 the brigadeer general commanding the georgian peacekeeping forces announced that georgia has declared a war against south ossetia they announced this publicly looking straight into the tv cameras at that point we tried to contact the georgian leadership but everyone refused to talk to us at 12 45 am on the 8th of august the georgian commander repeated his statement so who attacked whom

8794454 over the moon with the offer and making arrangements as i write
8794455 on my own the art of being a woman alone
8794456 and i think that if i were to seriously consider running on a national ticket i would essentially have to start now before having served a day in the senate now there might be some people comfortable doing that but im not one of those people
8794457 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8794458 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8794459 to the love of my life our next first lady michelle obama and to sasha and malia i love you so much and im so proud of all of you
8794460 to all my fellow citizens of this great nation with profound gratitude i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8794461 the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey
8794462 the next vice president of the united states joe biden
8794463 a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8794464 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8794465 on november fourth we must stand up and say eight is enough
8794466 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8794467 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8794468 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8794469 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states
8794470 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8794471 the united states believes that the settlement actions and the announcements that are taking place are indeed having a negative effect on the atmosphere for negotiation
8794472 in recent years the trend has accelerated to eliminate the green line through intensive construction intended to create a territorial connection between the blocks of settlements and isolated settlements in the heart of the west bank
8794473 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
8794474 the role of leaders is to try and find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room
8794475 i cant imagine the judge knew that the building housed many different organizations
8794476 to go into a building and take everybodys stuff but thats what i believe happened and thats not right
8794477 and we never had any problems even while long hail had the marijuana club here

8794485 mindset and i contend there is no difference in the mindset at all i notice now that average americans can no longer afford to drive these kinds of vehicles so they are dumping them just like europeans in similar situations
8794486 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8794487 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8794488 we were thrilled by the high calibre of films we had to choose from this year
8794489 for the engaging way it conveyed a whole tapestry of science
8794490 the film got to the essence of successful science communication which is to condense complex issues into a vehicle that explains science simply and in a fun way
8794491 deletes records of cookies passwords search queries temporary internet files form data and words typed into the address bar
8794492 online search engine yahoo was vilified by human rights campaigners after it disclosed details of its users to the chinese government
8794493 the information led to the arrests of writers and dissidents one journalist was tracked down and jailed for ten years for subversion after yahoo passed on his e mail and ip address to officials yahoo had argued that it had no option but to comply with local laws
8794494 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
8794495 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
8794496 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighborhood in that cell
8794497 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra selectively to inhibit platelet function
8794498 mesothelioma most frequently arises from the cells lining the sacs of the chest the pleura or the abdomen the peritoneum
8794499 but weve got something that stops at newtown road and it doesnt make sense to start something else

8794519 i had repeatedly warned against such a serious development less than two weeks ago i warned that the situation in some southern areas is very serious especially in the jezzine region and its surroundings where there are security zones that we do not know who is in charge of them
8794520 the message has been received and the army command should be decisive in handling this issue the government also should take the needed measures and should be frank to the lebanese people
8794521 the lebanese peoples right to be informed of the situation in the south and the people has the right to know the truth about the situation in the south the bekaa the north and beirut it is our right to know in which direction the nation is headed and who is responsible for its sovereignty and the peoples security

8794524 current land clearing for forestry on the tiwi islands was approved by the former clp government and howard government with no public scrutiny
8794525 under a labor government any proposals for further land clearing on the tiwi islands will require a full environmental impact statement ensuring community input in the process and will include considerations of the carbon emission impact of large scale land clearing
8794526 my governments environmental policies are in stark contrast to those of terry mills and the clp they put the territorys environment at risk
8794527 the clp will immediately approve land clearing applications on the daly river destroying fishing in this iconic river terry mills is just not up to it
8794528 we welcome mr hendersons announcement as a sensible and practical measure to ensure that the environmental economic and social dimensions of any further clearing on the tiwis are fully understood and debated and that alternative options for development on the island are fully explored
8794529 land clearing is a major threat to the territorys environment we are pleased that the territory government is acting to ensure adequate environmental assessment on the tiwi islands

8794531 we found no difference in the proportion of stems twining clockwise versus anticlockwise between the hemispheres
8794532 ninety two per cent of the stems we recorded twined in an anticlockwise direction
8794533 we are now investigating the possibility that the widespread phenomenon of anticlockwise twining arises as a function of the left handed bias of all biological molecules on earth
8794534 all natural proteins on earth are left handed molecules with a tendency to twist in one direction
8794535 in plants the cell skeletons are made of proteins if the proteins have a tendency to twist to the left so might the plant stems

8794556 its an incredible honor ive been getting a lot of kudos and id like to thank disney for offering those safety classes
8794557 its really special and ill remember that for the rest of my life
8794558 now i feel like my coworkers are really supportive of me they really are family they agree i have heart and i show it
8794559 its given me a broader perspective as a person its human nature and we need to do things as they come

8794563 america needs a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8794564 look at me im the nice guy i said good job
8794565 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
8794566 he helped me remember what america used to be like because the last eight years have been demoralizing
8794567 are they feasible can he fix health care and the economy cut our dependence on foreign oil and cut taxes
8794568 hes a really good speaker hes motivational he gives that great locker room speech
8794569 hes really ingratiating himself to me who is typically republican
8794570 forty seven million people who cant go to the doctor as i can bothers me
8794571 i dont think in an acceptance speech he can go too much into it
8794572 hes trying to reach out to the anti bush republicans
8794573 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8794574 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8794575 let me spell out exactly what that change will mean if i am president
8794576 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8794577 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8794578 a misleading speech that was fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8794579 people had wanted him to be strong and lay out the argument for whats going on for the american people
8794580 thats what hes doing theres no wimpy guy up there
8794581 sen obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8794582 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8794583 we claim the victory for barack as the first african american president of the united states
8794584 this is something i never thought i would live to see
8794585 in my lifetime i never thought i would see a black president and im only 29
8794586 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8794587 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8794588 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8794589 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8794590 to end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8794591 not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8794592 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8794593 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8794594 we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8794595 im emotionally kind of a middle of the road guy i know what to expect
8794596 anybody running is going to say something they wish theyd have kept
8794597 what went through my mind the work has just begun its not partying time partying time will be after he wins the presidency officially we have begun the race
8794598 i may be somewhat emotional myself because it is history and anytime you make history well i may get teary eyed i knew the time would come but i never thought i would see it in my lifetime
8794599 to witness it upfront it will bring tears to your eye its a monumental thing im not subject to break down all the way but im subject to break down
8794600 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8794601 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8794602 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change we need
8794603 we have always said that we have nothing against a foreign buyer it always depends on what business model is behind it
8794604 our concern is primarily about the preservation of jobs every concept which destroys jobs is a bad idea

8794612 simple preferences for example of wearing womens clothing i dont know that we need to use our antidiscrimination laws in minnesota and nationally to protect that kind of behavior
8794613 go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less
8794614 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it
8794615 but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8794616 in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8794617 renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
8794618 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8794619 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy
8794620 maybe for john mccain the american dream means seven houses and if thats your america than john mccain is your candidate
8794621 i know exactly how many houses i own john mccain is a yes man
8794622 he is blessed with a richly resonant voice that we love to hear he could read the telephone directory and it would sound good
8794623 he is very good at pauses and inflection and he cuts an impressive figure on stage all of which adds up to making an obama speech a special event
8794624 if you go through presidents and look what made the great ones probably a length of time in the united states congress doesnt help too much same with governorships
8794625 thats the language of american politics for both the mainstream left and the mainstream right but that idea is not really sustainable when we look at the facts
8794626 forty five years later barack obama epitomizes what dr king was dreaming of that one can move from the bottom of the ladder to the top of the ladder
8794627 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8794628 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8794629 lorsque jai vu la liste des partants jai remarqu quil y avait beaucoup de bons coureurs
8794630 you have got people encouraged to buy a block of land way out of the city and they are having to travel for three hours a day to commute thats not sustainable
8794631 people there live in town houses or terrace houses the houses are never one storey and you have got the population that lives closer to the city
8794632 we have to curtail land subdivisions at the extremities of the city the other option is to put in some very fast trains to regional centres somewhere like geelong could be an attractive destination for working and living
8794633 the population is still growing and theres a demand for these properties
8794634 its near impossible to dictate to the market what should happen the thing thats keeping victorias economy very competitive compared to the mining states is we are very competitive in housing
8794635 coming into the tournament obviously we wanted gold i dont know we probably would have been a little disappointed if we knew we were going to get third he says but this feels unbelievable right now to beat a great team like that who has given us a lot of trouble its a really big moment for us were feeling very proud of ourselves right now
8794636 to come back and leave with an olympic medal help the u s totals its gonna be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
8794637 if we have the same year we had this year for the next two years winning 10 titles or more its realistic were still pretty young and we feel like were still improving were so much better than we were coming out of stanford our communication has always been good but now we serve bigger return better poach more effectively play the big points well we know what to eat how much to sleep how to play different types of opponents what our schedule should be

8794641 tara is a really strong racer and she used her abilities perfectly it was a very tactical final and i had to really keep focused and not deviate from my plan

8794643 its going to take time to climb the international rankings to be where i want to be but my plan is to be in the mix in 2012

8794647 we have no way of knowing whether or not richard cooey is just blowing smoke and making things up or whether he did in fact did kill somebody else more than 20 years ago
8794648 on this day i become the first black american presidential nominee of a major party
8794649 it is my birthday damn it and i want to talk to you
8794650 that it is your job to undo what i did i want you to take back the south i want you to do that for me it is my home and you can start to do it my own people my own party lost out since 1964 because i made them do the right thing and pass the voting rights act it is time for the people who were not born or just born like you at the time to tell the old bigots to shove aside and make way for the democratic party
8794651 go with your gut tell the truth to people remember to say thanks to those who are with you and to tell those fancy pants republicans they dont get to own the whole country
8794652 dont worry ann richards keeps me informed and now that i have eternity i can read all the papers and slow down to just one tv news program at a time you can do it son and do it for me
8794653 based on our discussions it was determined that it would probably be in dr paxtons best interest and the colleges best interest that he resign as president
8794654 i find it extremely troubling that a parent would say the things he wrote in those messages
8794655 lief bloomquist was in need of some geeky nostalgia he thought making a bbs server on a commodore 64 would fill that need perfectly he used a pc running some routing software to make the bbs server available over the net without any long distance charges anyone with an internet connection can telnet to the bbs and join the fun
8794656 this is a late summer heat wave said steve anderson a forecaster for the national weather service in monterey
8794657 it will still be hot on friday in some places with near record temperatures so people should still take precautions anderson said
8794658 its burning hot like hell outside and our air conditioner is broken at home its cooler in here definitely said liang 17 who decided to go to the center to do her homework
8794659 everyone is sitting at home with the a c and they dont want to come out
8794660 if it gets over 100 we start sending guys home early
8794661 there was no bomb threat at santa teresa high school
8794662 its very satisfying to see a project this complex come to fruition
8794663 no one including the task force knew what the outcome would be it took many twists and turns
8794664 thats what inspired my interest it became really important to me
8794665 im thrilled and i applaud the city for sticking with it
8794666 i had not worked with government per se and i didnt have any expectation that it would take this long
8794667 it took a while for the city to figure out how to make it work financially

8794673 what if my parents are raptured and i am left behind
8794674 why cant he just appear and take away my doubts
8794675 a nation of whiners now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year
8794676 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8794677 for over two decades mccain has subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own well its time for them to own their failure
8794678 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8794679 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8794680 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8794681 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives

8794689 lance corporal marks was killed conducting a combat operation in an extremely demanding environment
8794690 a thorough inquiry was undertaken into his death the inquiry officer looked at equipment training the operational situation and available support on the day of the incident to ascertain if there was anything that could have been done to prevent lance corporal markss death
8794691 theres no change at this stage but that depends on journalists and if they put picket lines in place
8794692 we would expect our people not to cross a picket line
8794693 this protest rally is open to everyone in the community to come out and support high quality journalism at the age and to condemn the low cost low quality journalism that fairfax management wishes to impose
8794694 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action
8794695 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8794696 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8794697 the company has been putting out rumours to that effect for the last couple of weeks we were well aware that thats how they would try and get the papers out if we went on strike
8794698 we would urge people who work for rural press to just continue to do their normal work and to not come in and support fairfax at this time
8794699 but this company puts its employees in a terrible situation and gives them often little choice but to obey its directives its not clear these people are doing it willingly theyve clearly been directed by the company
8794700 its my understanding that mike was unprepared to write during the strike
8794701 this is an indication again that the new regime at fairfax media is embarking on a low quality approach to journalism
8794702 the management is prepared to trample on anyone who gets in their way and the people who will lose out in this case are the sydney morning herald readers
8794703 brutal said further bureau mergers and cuts were being considered
8794704 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8794705 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8794706 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaux of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaux
8794707 you can slim it down to one bureau in canberra covering everything but you end up diminishing the analysis of the democratic process and very seriously so
8794708 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not the part of the business that is being affected at all
8794709 its really quite mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
8794710 the fact that this guy is going to jail for walking dogs i think it highlights the lack of proportionality of this prosecution this case
8794711 it shouldnt be a criminal case this isnt someone who did anything purposely to any animal or person
8794712 i think what happened is theres a couple dogs that are still up there and theyre his dogs
8794713 i think hes put in the tough position he had the option of neglecting them or making sure those two dogs that were left were cared for
8794714 despite animal services and sheriffs offices numerous attempts they have been unable to locate him

8794741 forty five years later barack obama epitomizes what dr king was dreaming of that one can move from the bottom of the ladder to the top of the ladder
8794742 what clinton offers in 1992 in terms of rhetorical eloquence and political genius is this notion that the democratic party can still help poor people but its going to have to do this on a much smaller scale
8794743 he talks about we need a leaner government and not a meaner government

8794775 while the xbox 360 anti gravity tour will be a fun attention grabbing way for us to reach young consumers partnering with asa in their annual efforts to spread the campaign for tobacco free kids message gives us a welcome opportunity to tout this important cause
8794776 states mike fischer general manager of u s marketing for xbox and games for windows
8794777 this partnership brings together two great leaders in their respective fields in support of a very deserving cause
8794778 action sports resonate strongly with high school aged kids so combining our efforts to deliver the campaign for tobacco free kids message via the xbox360 anti gravity tour is an ideal way for us to bring relevant attention to this program
8794779 what i mean is i didnt start running because somebody asked me to become a runner just like i didnt become a novelist because someone asked me to one day out of the blue i wanted to write a novel and one day out of the blue i started to run simply because i wanted to ive always done whatever i felt like doing in life people may try to stop me and convince me im wrong but i wont change i look up at the sky wondering if ill catch a glimpse of kindness there but i dont all i see are indifferent summer clouds drifting over the pacific and they have nothing to say to me clouds are always taciturn i probably shouldnt be looking up at them what i should be looking at is inside of me like staring down into a deep well can i see kindness there no all i see is my own nature my own individual stubborn uncooperative often self centered nature that still doubts itself that when troubles occur tries to find something funny or nearly funny about the situation ive carried this character around like an old suitcase down a long dusty path im not carrying it because i like it the contents are too heavy and it looks crummy fraying in spots ive carried it with me because there was nothing else i was supposed to carry still ive grown attached to it as you might expect
8794780 hindi ko alam na ako lang pala ang nasa top 10 list never naman ako nakapasok talaga sa top 10 list e ngayon lang talaga kaya sobrang na overwhelmed ako
8794781 tapos first time kong mag pictorial talaga ng medyo daring sa shower kasi ako kinunan kaya kita ang mga pinaghirapan kong mga abdominal muscles napakinabangan ko naman sila sa pictorial in fairness
8794782 pero talagang kinarir ko ang magkaroon ng ganitong physique maganda ang resulta ng pagpapapawis ko sa gym at siyempre kung kasama ka rin lang sa top 10 list ng cosmo e gandahan mo na ang gustong makita ng mga tao sa iyo di ba para mas bongga
8794783 may time pa rin naman hindi naman demanding si isabel e alam niyang workaholic ako kaya she understands kung minsan ay wala kaming time na magkasama but when i do have the time todo ang labas namin as in buong araw magkasama kami so i am making up for loss time sa kanya
8794784 trust us everything will be fine and dandy and well save the world from you too
8794785 these types of trailers theres a chute underneath it comes into a hopper a mechanism to control the flow of materials and at the base of the hopper theres a sliding trap door that opens to unload these trailers so they unload very rapidly
8794786 its not uncommon for children to be on top of such farming equipment watching as the grain is unloaded
8794787 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8794788 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8794789 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8794790 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8794791 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8794792 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8794793 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
8794794 this election has never been about me its about you
8794795 its a moment in our history that well never forget
8794796 most times people are offering thousands of dollars to get out of politicians speeches
8794797 im going for maximum death and destruction in the work place
8794798 what i discovered is that barack obama is a man of faith a man of values and a man of action someone who has shown his love for america by fighting for our people helping communities left behind on chicagos south side fighting today for working families and the tax breaks we need to purchase a home pay for college and save for retirement
8794799 the united states is now more dependent on foreign oil than it ever was
8794800 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8794801 chris smelley did come in and play very well well have to wsatch the tape analyze it to see what in the world happened to tommy
8794802 i went out there and gave it everything i had
8794803 id like to play next week its the thing ive been working for well see how it goes
8794804 basically a tough start the game was fine until the last series we fumbled the ball at the half the first series of the second half we let it gete away from us
8794805 i thought we played ok its not time to start breaking out the champagne or anything
8794806 down in the shadow of the penitentiary out by the gas fires of the refinery ten years burnin down the road nowhere to run aint got nowhere to go
8794807 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8794808 lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty
8794809 young old man take a look at yourself youre a lot like me
8794810 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
8794811 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
8794812 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
8794813 things didnt happen the way we wanted but youve got to expect that out of any football game
8794814 especially when youre playing such a good opponent like miami
8794815 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
8794816 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays
8794817 it felt like we had a junior or senior out there playing quarterback
8794818 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
8794819 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
8794820 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
8794821 we are a team that is very young and new to the big scene
8794822 41 points is a lot better than 14 im sure of that an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
8794823 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run
8794824 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8794825 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8794826 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8794827 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8794828 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8794829 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8794830 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8794831 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8794832 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8794833 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8794834 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8794835 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8794836 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8794837 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8794838 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8794839 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8794840 he says he will chase mccain to the gates of hell but he wont go to the cave he lives in
8794841 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8794842 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8794843 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8794844 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8794845 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8794846 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8794847 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8794848 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8794849 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8794850 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8794851 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8794852 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8794853 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8794854 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8794855 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8794856 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8794857 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8794858 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8794859 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8794860 wala rin akong quarrel with her and we have not violated any contract with her were always careful in implementing the contract wala talagang away
8794861 ang pinagmulan as far as the issue is concerned ay ang date ng birthday special nina dingdong at marian hindi namin hawak ang booking ng araneta coliseum and i was told fully booked na sila sa original date na gusto namin which is august 29 and 30 two days talaga dahil ang isang araw is for the set up you can check with the booking of araneta at wala talagang libreng date kundi august 27

8794865 kung may na misinform man o bugso ng damdamin hindi namin yun gusto you cant control the reaction of each people but we can control our reaction and our reaction is to keep quiet we are not it is not in our nature para mang away we do not do that conflict is not our nature hindi namin sasadyain ang ganun para masira ang iba most especially mga artistang inaalagaan natin also i dont want to indulge in fabrication that is not the right way to approach things
8794866 kung kilala mo ang isang tao pati reaction niya mapag aaralan mo na will you worry will you be scared you know how will you react and im okay ang energy niya malakas at ayaw kong sabayan its not going to be productive at walang pupuntahan
8794867 tingin ko nadala rin lang siya ng damdamin sana maunawaan niya na there was no malice intended wala talaga as i said i cannot control how other people will react
8794868 i am responsible and i will stand by it i will be the one to explain and im responsible for that
8794869 oo ia address mo yun pag may ginawa you have to be prepared what to do next pero hindi ibig sabihin na prepared kaming mawala si richard hindi yun ang ibig kong sabihin and thats why we have contract
8794870 kung iniisip ninyong naligalig kami wala kung wala kang masamang intention hindi ka maliligalig inuulit ko ang pagsasabing sa mga nangyari walang malisya yun kung may sumama ang loob humihingi ako ng paumanhin doon hindi mo rin gustong may negative reaction kung hindi ka man naintindihan or they were misinformed and for their being negatively affected sorry
8794871 i am sorry not because im at fault i feel sorry how they reacted to it nagkaroon ng bugso ng damdamin pero theres no malice intended
8794872 hindi takot ang network kay annabelle rama we have a professional relationship that we try to implement as best as we could
8794873 hindi ko yan sasagutin mahal ng network si richard we have no problem with him
8794874 we are very happy and very proud na dalawa sa piakamagaling na talents ay nandito sa gma
8794875 the general viewing public the viewers is the boss hanggang magaganda ang show na ginagawa ninyo wala silang pakialam sa away gusto nila ma entertain ng good show at the end of the day kung pangit ang show mo hindi ka panonoorin mabuti na lang magaganda ang shows namin at magagaling ang talents ng gma
8794876 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8794877 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8794878 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8794879 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8794880 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8794888 to repeal certain laws prohibiting certain non residents from marrying in the commonwealth
8794889 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8794890 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8794891 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8794892 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

8794896 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8794897 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8794898 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8794899 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8794900 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8794901 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8794902 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8794903 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8794904 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8794905 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8794906 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8794907 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8794908 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8794909 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8794910 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8794911 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8794912 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8794913 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8794914 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8794915 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8794916 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8794917 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8794918 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8794919 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8794920 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8794921 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8794922 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8794923 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8794924 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8794925 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8794926 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8794927 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8794928 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8794929 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8795155 what we wanted to do was really kind of simulate what he was going to do on game day see how everything felt and see if he wanted to alter his routine for next sunday
8795156 i think he came away feeling pretty good about it he told me on the sidelines that if he started he would have felt in good shape and ready to go

8795158 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8795159 we had boarded the flight and sat for an hour and a half
8795160 we were then told we all had to disembark again
8795161 the pilot was left to tell all the passengers that there would no longer be a flight and the reasons for this
8795162 and what appears to be overlooked is the fact that the actor was still very combative at the hospital and it took eight staff members to restrain him his coma was not the direct result of being hit with the taser
8795163 he was in a seizure in my living room i didnt want the cops in my house if he wasnt having a seizure i could have handled it myself
8795164 there have been questions raised about whether tasers are being used in the way they are intended
8795165 physical affirmative actions which attempt to prevent an officers control but never attempts to harm the officer
8795166 spit a wad of fluffy like material from his mouth
8795167 when it was all said and done the bath mat was clearly superior in terms of intelligence but biden has more political experience and his ability to shake hands gave him the edge
8795168 its dangerous next thing you know there you are on youtube
8795169 you need to communicate with your peers that this is a serious crime and it needs to stop
8795170 due to circumstances beyond our control we are no longer able to keep the school open
8795171 these kids need to move on with their lives and get into new schools
8795172 some records have been held because they have balances owing were making sure everyone can get their records as quickly as they can we dont want kids and families left in the lurch
8795173 there are 15 years of alumni who may decide to go to college and they would need their transcripts
8795174 i think the principles laid out are very much the principles laid out in house bill 133
8795175 i was terrified to do this hold the meeting because i know how important it is to have something solid for the task force
8795176 i dont think people are looking at this as incremental change
8795177 its certainly in keeping with the true heart of air guitar which is world peace
8795178 you have an option as to whether or not you want to stay or leave
8795179 i really do not want to see her fucking genital warts

8795181 why do they have to get on top of you right in the middle of your farm land that youve worked all your life and cleared
8795182 were hearing that a major concern is health care getting comprehensive healthcare for everyone especially for those people that are uninsured because it does impact everybodys pocket book
8795183 we front loaded most of our production for the first half of the year
8795184 2009 is set now were doing preproduction work in anticipation of 2010
8795185 we hope these initial hints of decline in production days for the feature category dont blossom into the trend witnessed in 2001 when labor contract uncertainties resulted in a strong first half of the year for on location feature production followed by a drastic decline in the latter half
8795186 we were looking forward to the trip to cancun but with the severe weather in the area we decided it best to keep our team and student athletes out of potential harms way
8795187 we are disappointed but it is the right thing to do and we were able to get a few great days of practice in and get the freshmen on the court for one day as well were all really looking forward for the 2008 09 season and will get a chance to travel internationally before next year begins

8795194 bruce an apple aficionado since the very first ipod also recently returned a macbook air because it got too hot and said his apple cinema display monitor sports burned in images
8795195 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8795196 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8795197 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8795198 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8795199 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8795200 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits
8795201 in any job or any career the first year or two youre learning whether its for you

8795204 when they return from the academy the first thing i tell them is that its going to be tough lots of long hours
8795205 ive seen some interns realize after the first couple days that this is a different animal
8795206 individuals involved in animal abuse and dogfighting frequently have a background with gangs guns drugs and gambling
8795207 sharing intelligence in one division focused on investigating these crimes helps every unit reach the same objective of keeping the streets safe
8795208 the chicago police departments animal crimes unit will now be recognized as a more proactive unit to fight both animal abuse and public violence
8795209 we sell a couple thousand skis out of all the stores over the weekend plus snowboards and all that other kind of stuff

8795213 kisse girl was created november of 2006 one year later the product line was launched i grew up with very little confidence and low self esteem it took me years to overcome these issues my sole mission is to provide girls with products designed to help them feel good about who they are when you smell good you feel good when you feel good you look good and that makes you a kisse girl all of the products are made by me the lip balm lip gloss dry oil spray body splash and the body icing are all made from scratch and do not contain any preservatives harsh chemicals or petroleum which means they are all natural i want every girl to know that no one can replace you you are special and your existance matters nobody can walk in your shoes but you be you
8795214 why doesnt that machine have any napkins and what are taamm pons
8795215 those are for girls and women that are older than you
8795216 um well older girls and women need them but that is a little bit old for you when you are a little bit older we will talk more about it but for now you know they are for girls over the ago of 8
8795217 this eliminates a trip to the grocery store after work
8795218 we know that students will eat what is convenient and what they can think of
8795219 the market makes it convenient but it also helps us teach and improve health and support local farmers
8795220 we learned that a farmers market was one of the best ways to get students eating healthy
8795221 now we just need a market on monday and tuesday
8795222 i am grateful to represent 2 7 million state citizens tonight
8795223 we unite as a state and pray for comfort strength and understanding all our tears mingle together tonight
8795224 beyond the speeches how much do you really know about barack obama
8795225 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
8795226 an investigation of the american issues project its officers and directors and its anonymous donors whoever they may be
8795227 this is a sad ploy to circumvent the first amendment by a campaign who has no arguments with the merits of our ad its the classic maneuver if you cant win on the merits file a lawsuit
8795228 an appalling lie a disgraceful smear of the lowest kind on the senators patriotism and commitment to the rule of law
8795229 is inconsistent with your stations obligations under federal communications commission regulations
8795230 obama supporters have now sent more than 93 000 e mails to the sinclair stations that have decided to run the ad
8795231 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
8795232 how much do your really know about barack obama what does he really believe
8795233 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8795234 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
8795235 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8795236 the fact that obama is launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
8795237 what can i do to pay for my blogs costs without pissing off my subscriber and reader base
8795238 from day 1 when i came into this building ive always thought about the end
8795239 i never knew when it was going to be ive always prepared myself for life after football but football kept getting in the way for 14 years thank god
8795240 im going to miss the locker room if i didnt do anything else i hope i was a great teammate all i ever wanted to do was win

8795245 lance corporal marks was killed conducting a combat operation in an extremely demanding environment
8795246 a thorough inquiry was undertaken into his death the inquiry officer looked at equipment training the operational situation and available support on the day of the incident to ascertain if there was anything that could have been done to prevent lance corporal markss death
8795247 i have my staff get to you its condominiums have them get to you
8795248 i have my staff get to you its condominiums have them get to you
8795249 why are we concentrating on such a pro obama universe he could be leading by 20 points or more among those people
8795250 yes theyre undercounted but its too damn difficult and expensive to reach them
8795251 where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
8795252 more positive and im not a big believer in mccains plans for the plumming industry
8795253 cindy mccain is heiress to her fathers stake in the company
8795254 a one game approach and the kids never hear anything about a winning streak from the coaches
8795255 id rather sit naked in the snow and thrash myself with barbed wire
8795256 the original quality in any man of imagination is imagery it is a thing like the landscape of his dreams this general atmosphere and pattern or structure of growth governs all his creations however varied
8795257 laboriously and with dedication our thought processes continue even when we are not aware of them
8795258 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering cabin adjacent to the second main cabin doors
8795259 the cylinders been propelled up with significant force to do the damage that it has and its happened very quickly so it probably would have been a matter of seconds
8795260 these oxygen bottles are actually quite robust so it would take some significant force to do some damage like that
8795261 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8795262 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8795263 as far as we can tell from all the information thats available to us the crew have pretty much done a textbook response
8795264 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8795265 read the best books first or you may not have a chance to read them all
8795266 it is a combination of all of these things that make me want to know and care what happens next
8795267 you can change things you may find countless concealed facts you can control whatever you want
8795268 unbelievable freedom from all restrictions of body time and space
8795269 sounds of a melody so exquisitely sweet as to surpass anything that he had heard a hymn of the blessed and holy

8795273 and get from him willing or no a little ring the least of rings that once he stole
8795274 theres no change at this stage but that depends on journalists and if they put picket lines in place
8795275 we would expect our people not to cross a picket line
8795276 this protest rally is open to everyone in the community to come out and support high quality journalism at the age and to condemn the low cost low quality journalism that fairfax management wishes to impose
8795277 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action
8795278 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8795279 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8795280 the company has been putting out rumours to that effect for the last couple of weeks we were well aware that thats how they would try and get the papers out if we went on strike
8795281 we would urge people who work for rural press to just continue to do their normal work and to not come in and support fairfax at this time
8795282 but this company puts its employees in a terrible situation and gives them often little choice but to obey its directives its not clear these people are doing it willingly theyve clearly been directed by the company
8795283 its my understanding that mike was unprepared to write during the strike
8795284 this is an indication again that the new regime at fairfax media is embarking on a low quality approach to journalism
8795285 the management is prepared to trample on anyone who gets in their way and the people who will lose out in this case are the sydney morning herald readers
8795286 brutal said further bureau mergers and cuts were being considered
8795287 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8795288 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8795289 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaux of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaux
8795290 you can slim it down to one bureau in canberra covering everything but you end up diminishing the analysis of the democratic process and very seriously so
8795291 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not the part of the business that is being affected at all
8795292 its really quite mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
8795293 he did tell me that there was gossip around the city gym that rene and gordon were faggots
8795294 average is about the worst thing you can say about somebody average
8795295 i have no idea and ive never been told anything
8795296 i have no idea where it was where it is
8795297 ill have to back through and pull the thing back apart
8795298 you cant do it at your own 24 yard line thats the no 1 statistic in football you turn the football over you have to have some regard for it
8795299 its frustrating i said the biggest thing that kills me is the pick thats the one thing i go back to im sure there were some other things he saw that he thought i should have done better
8795300 i dont care if they were playing tiddlywinks or preseason football i hate to lose and i like putting my best foot forward so when we pick the 53 guys on the team were going to find 53 winners thats what were going to do
8795301 they have knocked on our door but we have declined
8795302 we have not had a meeting or discussion with roski all of our updates have come through the league our intention is to resolve the issue in minnesota but clearly they are out proactively seeking a team and they are the ones that listed the seven teams
8795303 our leadership in the state needs to step up and get engaged in a solution but were making some progress incremental progress so zygi basically declined to meet with roski at this time
8795304 im not considering moving the team im not considering selling it
8795305 the teams that have worked and communities that have worked with them to get those additional revenues through building new stadiums thats where its going to be we have no evidence that revenue sharing is needed for competitiveness
8795306 i dont know how you can compete if you dont get in a new facility
8795307 i cant imagine the twin cities being known as a low revenue team that would embarrass me
8795308 we have a decent relationship with the governor and he clearly knows the issues
8795309 he knows what needs to happen to get this done if he stays in minnesota if he doesnt get the nod we think thats a good scenario for us because hes got some clout and the ability to step up and get this done if hes on the ticket that certainly prevents him from getting more engaged with us until after the election

8795316 mobile social network revenues could reach us 52 billion by 2012
8795317 in 1987 the big 3 in coffee general foods procter amp gamble and nestle controlled about 90 percent of the u s market but starbucks appeared on the scene creating a market for upscale coffee that dramatically challenged the big 3 and the commodity like nature of their offerings all three had produced canned ground coffees that were made from the inexpensive beans of the robusta coffee plant of west africa competition between the leaders was based strictly on price since the tastes of their products were virtually indistinguishable

8795321 the mission of the world wide web consortium w3c is to lead the world wide web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability
8795322 we realized that if we could provide more applications around the pdf as the file format and acrobat reader as the rendering platform not only could we make many customers much more efficient and productive but it could be a valuable revenue opportunity
8795323 social networking web sites arent platforms theyre nightclubs if youre building a facebook app youre building a sound system you can never take out of the club spending money on something which wont work anywhere else only makes sense if the payoff is immediate its not really an investment because assuming any given social network will persist for any given amount of time defies history

8795345 that is a very impressive handset i believe consumers want that sort of spec i believe it will drive data adoption

8795349 well you can see that the package says four ounces and so if there was half of it left that would be two ounces which is less than the allowed three ounces per item but you can see that there is less than even half of it left
8795350 we have to go by what it says on the package
8795351 so if i carried an empty four ounce bottle on board you would confiscate it
8795352 but if there was one ounce of liquid in it you would confiscate it

8795411 debemos aclarar que cada pa s rep blica dominicana y hait ser an responsables del costo de construcci n que ata e a sus respectivos territorios

8795441 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8795442 pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8795443 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8795444 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8795445 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8795446 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our e mail boxes
8795447 obama supporters risibly complain that shining a light on the obama ayers relationship is a smear and smacks of guilt by association a presidential candidates choice to associate himself with an unrepentant terrorist would be highly relevant in any event does anyone think the obamedia would keep mum if john mccain had a long standing relationship with david duke or an abortion clinic bomber

8795470 an overflowing enthusiastic crowd determined to bring home victory for obama in november
8795471 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8795472 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8795473 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8795474 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8795475 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8795476 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8795477 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8795478 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8795479 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8795480 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8795481 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8795482 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8795483 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8795484 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8795485 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8795486 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8795487 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8795488 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8795489 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8795490 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8795491 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8795492 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8795493 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8795494 its two nfl hall of famers in terry bradshaw and fred dean a college hall of famer in coach joe aillet and another retired jersey and future hall of famer in willie roaf
8795495 this is really the elite at tech and we are all proud to have them as part of our family its the least we can do to honor them i do think it brings the stadium to life and makes you enjoy driving by
8795496 overall its something my relatives and all of my friends can come to see
8795497 there is so much tradition at tech everyone should experience it words cannot express how it makes me feel it makes me feel like i can come home and give something back to tech im here and i can share and thats what is important
8795498 it really starts with a big picture philosophy of how can we improve our game day experience and honor the legends of the past
8795499 one of the things that ahs been important to me is take the dated look out of stadium and bring it to life you can visualize the banners but until they went up it didnt hit me the kind of pop it has
8795500 if you think thats a lot you should see how much his purse costs
8795501 fogo este gajo anda com esta m mas anda de c

8795503 its about action i can talk they can talk we can all talk
8795504 its not hard to do that but it doesnt make any difference
8795505 so its about actions and the challenge to the players is im confident they can do it and i hope theyre confident they can do it
8795506 the group has responded to probably every challenge that has been thrown at them over the past six years
8795507 we started off the season people said we couldnt make the eight weve done that again
8795508 so weve answered a few questions there are now some questions about us again and hopefully we can answer those questions also
8795509 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well but ive still got enormous faith in this group and the team and the players that we can turn it around
8795510 can we win next week we absolutely can next week if we play our best footy and get our guys into some form
8795511 and thats the challenge for all of us to get back into form
8795512 actually ryan is a bit crook so hes one who might not play
8795513 its just the flu going around he was a bit crook yesterday
8795514 we wont take any risks with him hes probably a 50 50 chance at this stage
8795515 if we do well and we win the game on saturday ring me up on saturday afternoon and ill speak to you about the opposition
8795516 ill tell you right now we dont talk about who we play or who we might play the following week until we win this game of footy
8795517 its just a bit of a myth with the media guys that we start to talk about what may or may not occur
8795518 you just cant afford to do that in this competition otherwise you get your pants pulled down
8795519 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8795520 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8795521 victimised by threats that he would be sacked unless he suspended the tribunal proceedings
8795522 the met will not at this time be commenting publicly in detail on the content of assistant commissioner ghaffurs claims other than to say that we do not accept the charges of discrimination against us and intend to robustly challenge them
8795523 it is long past time we all shut up stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do

8795525 while pushing to take on saddam hussein mr mccain also made arguments and statements that he may no longer wish to recall he lauded the war planners he would later criticize including defense secretary donald h rumsfeld and vice president dick cheney mr mccain even volunteered that he would have given the same job to mr cheney he urged support for the later discredited iraqi exile ahmad chalabis opposition group the iraqi national congress and echoed some of its suspect accusations in the national media and he advanced misleading assertions not only about mr husseins supposed weapons programs but also about his possible ties to international terrorists al qaeda and the sept 11 attacks
8795526 his critics charge that the emotion of sept 11 overwhelmed his former cool eyed caution about deploying american troops without a clear national interest and a well defined exit turning him into a tool of the bush administration in its push for a war to transform the region

8795632 while the increase in the number of children with disability attending school is encouraging more has to be done to close the significant gap in employment between people with disability and people without disability
8795633 the australian government is working with the states and territories to ensure adequate education and support services for children with disability
8795634 the results demonstrate the importance of the australian governments national mental health and disability employment strategy which will help address the many barriers people with disability face when looking for and keeping work
8795635 the strategy to be released at the end of the year will outline clear and practical steps that can be put in place to support people with disability and mental illness in the workplace
8795636 we also understand the urgent need to establish better data collection to help improve support services for people with disability and their family

8795645 despite the strong field of nominees there was one australian who really stood out one person who has been associated with privacy law its development and its application for over 30 years
8795646 justice kirby not only influenced the development of australian privacy laws but also developed the principles that underpin all privacy laws in the developed world
8795647 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8795648 the australian government believes its fundamentally important to nurture a strong culture of privacy within its agencies to gain and maintain customer confidence
8795649 its also pleasing to note that two other agencies in my portfolio medicare australia and centrelink were also finalists in the privacy commissioners awards with medicare winning the grand award
8795650 the award acknowledges the csas commendable model and sound strategies for protecting privacy
8795651 and while it is pleasing to be acknowledged through this award there is no room for complacency when it comes to privacy and the csa will continue to build on our excellence
8795652 the c 17 aircraft and support provisions were delivered ahead of schedule under budget and exceeding performance expectations
8795653 ordinarily a defence capability of this magnitude and complexity would take in excess of five years from project approval to delivery
8795654 however the accelerated schedule never before attempted by defence in the modern aviation era included a requirement to have the first c 17 operational by january 2007 and all four c 17 aircraft delivered by mid 2008
8795655 the achievement of these ambitious outcomes was made possible through a whole of defence team effort and the fantastic support and cooperation of the united states air force and the aircraft manufacturer the c 17 is already proving to be a great capability for australia
8795656 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8795657 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8795658 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8795659 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8795660 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8795661 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8795662 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8795663 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8795664 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8795665 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8795666 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8795667 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8795668 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d
8795669 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8795670 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8795671 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8795672 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8795673 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8795674 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8795675 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8795676 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8795677 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8795678 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8795679 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8795680 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8795681 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8795682 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8795683 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8795684 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8795685 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8795686 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8795687 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8795688 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8795689 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8795690 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8795691 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8795692 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8795693 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8795694 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8795695 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8795696 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8795697 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8795698 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8795699 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8795700 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8795701 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8795702 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8795703 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
8795704 mark served as chief executive from january 2001 overseeing many important reforms including the upgrade of facilities at the australian institute of sport the establishment of a european training centre for australian athletes and the success of australian olympic teams at the athens and beijing games
8795705 under marks leadership the asc also saw significant growth in funding which doubled from 97 6 million to almost 220 million and saw the implementation of valuable grassroots sport and physical activity initiatives like the highly popular active after school communities aasc program
8795706 in the short time the aasc has been operating it has grown to involve more than 100 000 young school kids in many hundreds of communities around the country reinforcing the vital role sport and physical activity plays in the healthy development of our children
8795707 marks decision to seek new opportunities and challenges leaves behind some awfully large shoes to fill
8795708 on behalf of the australian government i want to thank mark peters for the important contribution he has made to advancing sport in australia and i wish him all the best for the future
8795709 the commonwealth government is committed to funding community organisations throughout the country and the joint funding agreement for queensland hacc services is proof we are delivering
8795710 the hacc program provides many services to assist with daily activities that most people take for granted such as domestic chores help with dressing and grooming and access to the community
8795711 for frail older people or other people with a disability these tasks can be challenging this assistance will allow people to continue to live their daily lives with friends and family with dignity
8795712 hacc is an outstanding example of what can be achieved through commonwealth and state governments by working together
8795713 the new triennial funding agreement will enable many more carer organisations across queensland to provide these vital community services across the state
8795714 it will enable the organisations help more queenslanders stay in the comfort of their own homes for longer instead of having to move into permanent care
8795715 there are also programs to provide culturally appropriate support for people from aboriginal and torres strait islander backgrounds
8795716 from helping to tackle obesity and preventable disease through to preparing our elite athletes for the growing challenges of international competition i am determined to ensure that australias sporting structure remains ahead of the pack
8795717 sport plays an important role in health and education as well as the social and cultural life of communities throughout australia and we need to build on this tradition
8795718 engagement in sport and physical activities by the wider community is also vital in helping to build a better and healthier australia and we want it to play a leading role in delivering on the governments preventative health agenda
8795719 david pam colin mark and sam bring a wealth of experience and expertise and i am confident they will do a great job i look forward to working with them to safeguard australias sporting system
8795720 recent quarterly economic forecasts from the bank of england british chambers of commerce and oxford economics suggest that the uks economic prospects have worsened significantly over the past few months
8795721 the labour market is expected to loosen as a result of this which in turn is likely to reduce the level of pressure on wage demands
8795722 to what extent unemployment increases and inflation falls between now and the autumn will be key to the level of pay awards we see at the start of the major bargaining activity in january 2009
8795723 when inflation begins eating into workers wages it is all the more important to set our sights on settlements that will protect living standards not least when we know that the cost of many essentials is way ahead of the official inflation rate
8795724 dear lady the confidence i have in your charity makes me thus bold i have an orphan daughter whose wedding is on this night she and i are both strangers and have no acquaintance in this town which much perplexes me therefore most beautiful lady if you would vouchsafe to honor the wedding with your presence we shall be infinitely obliged because the family with whom we shall be allied will then know that we are not regarded here as unworthy and despised persons but alas madam if you refuse this request how great will be our mortification we know not where else to apply
8795725 do not afflict yourself i will grant you the favor you desire tell me whither i must go and i will meet you as soon as i am dressed
8795726 god will reward the kindness you have shown to your servants and make your heart as joyful as you have made theirs you need not at present trouble yourself i will call for you in the evening
8795727 dear lady the relations of my son in law who are the principal ladies of the city are now met together you may come when you please i am ready to conduct you
8795728 you are brought hither to assist at a wedding but i hope it will be a different wedding from what you expected i have a brother one of the handsomest men in the world his fate depends wholly upon you and he will be the unhappiest of men if you do not take pity on him if my prayers madam can prevail i shall join them with his and humbly beg you will not refuse the proposal of being his wife
8795729 dear mistress since you want silk stuffs i must take you to a young merchant of my acquaintance who has a great variety and that you may not fatigue yourself by running from shop to shop i can assure you that you will find in his what no other can furnish
8795730 i will not sell it for gold or money but i will make her a present of it if she will give me leave to kiss her cheek
8795731 what the merchant desires of you is no such great matter you need not speak but only present him your cheek
8795732 i beg your pardon for i am the cause of this misfortune having brought you to this merchant because he is my countryman but i never thought he would be guilty of such a villainous action but do not grieve let us hasten home and i will apply a remedy that shall in three days so perfectly cure you that not the least mark shall be visible
8795733 that as i was going under his permission to purchase a silk stuff a camel carrying a load of wood came so near to me in a narrow street that one of the sticks grazed my cheek but had not done me much hurt
8795734 to morrow morning before sunrise the grand vizier giafar shall be informed of this insolence and cause all the camel drivers to be put to death
8795735 let me beg of you to pardon them for they are not guilty
8795736 what then am i to believe speak for i am resolved to know the truth from your own mouth
8795737 i was taken with a giddiness and fell down and that is the whole matter
8795738 cut her in two and then throw her into the tigris this is the punishment i inflict on those to whom i have given my heart when they falsify their promise
8795739 since i have been your nurse and brought you up let me beg you to consider he who kills shall be killed and that you will stain your reputation and forfeit the esteem of mankind
8795740 for your sake i will spare her life but she shall bear about her person some marks to make her remember her offense
8795741 its drab its bleak and the wind blows all the time when marketing it we have to be careful not to raise expectations
8795742 dont come here hondeklipbaai has nothing no entertainment no firewood nothing stay away
8795743 in the war they told me i was hero but then the magistrate said i was a danger to society
8795744 when i came out another ex recce whos a diamond diver told me about hondeklipbaai he said its the perfect place to come if you want to start a new life
8795745 thats all they have been talking about it certainly stuck with them and they havent forgot that they know they are extremely close they started lifting monday after the state championship game they are very motivated
8795746 hes made the biggest transition from junior to senior year since ive been here
8795747 he has come into his own i cant believe how much hes grown and matured and confidence wise he wasnt on radar as a starter and now hes starting at corner too
8795748 overall the kids will be a good unit that works well together
8795749 there is so much talent and depth on defense theyve been in the fire played in some big playoff games they are very mature they play an aggressive style of defense
8795750 these kids have high expectations and weve put a lot of demands on them the biggest thing is to expect to win last year it was a younger group now were mature this is it these seniors were 9 0 their freshman year 7 2 their sophomore year with five kids playing up on varsity i think their expectations are high and they should be
8795751 we have a lot of experience coming back and you hope youve improved since last year thats the main thing
8795752 we had them in the weight room working so you hope good things are going to happen we want to win our conference which hasnt been done in several years
8795753 fogo este gajo anda com esta m mas anda de c

8795759 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8795760 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8795761 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8795762 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain

8795769 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8795770 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8795771 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8795772 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8795773 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8795774 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8795775 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming

8795777 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8795778 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8795779 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8795780 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8795781 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8795782 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8795783 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8795784 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8795785 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8795786 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8795787 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8795788 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8795789 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8795790 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8795791 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8795792 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8795793 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8795794 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8795795 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8795796 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8795797 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8795798 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8795799 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8795800 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8795801 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8795802 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8795803 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8795804 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8795805 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8795806 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income

8795812 wed like to not have to play him both ways

8795814 tanners biggest strength is his athleticism and his ability to comprehend the schemes that were trying to implement
8795815 our backs arent quite as big as theyve been in the past but theyre definitely just as athletic and just as fast
8795816 the thing we do talk about is where this program came from and where it is now the kids understand there is a tradition now and while you cant rely on tradition to win it can give you certain expectations
8795817 this group knows they need to start at square one but they also have expectations
8795818 a fast fluid and gorgeous game with a remarkable control scheme a gratifying sense of progression and its own unique sensibility

8795839 as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
8795840 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8795841 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8795842 i guess by tomorrow they will have their act a little more in order

8795848 chicago barack obama says hes decided on a running mate but he wont say who the democratic presidential candidate told usa today on thursday that he went with someone who is independent and would challenge him in the white house he also said he wanted someone who is prepared to be president and would help him strengthen the economy

8795852 australia really knows how to do big sports events weve all watched with great admiration as theyve staged international events such as sydney 2000 that are recognised as among the very best
8795853 at london 2012 we receive valuable advice from many of those involved in the planning of the sydney 2000 olympics and our chief executive david higgins is of course an australian who worked on sydney and brings huge experience from this period
8795854 in addition we and locog are already working with 10 australian businesses on various projects and their support will be crucial as we plan towards london 2012
8795855 with 2012 now on the horizon we thought it timely for the uk and australia to network as the big build begins for the london games and beijing is the perfect place to showcase our expertise

8795859 while the increase in the number of children with disability attending school is encouraging more has to be done to close the significant gap in employment between people with disability and people without disability
8795860 the australian government is working with the states and territories to ensure adequate education and support services for children with disability
8795861 the results demonstrate the importance of the australian governments national mental health and disability employment strategy which will help address the many barriers people with disability face when looking for and keeping work
8795862 the strategy to be released at the end of the year will outline clear and practical steps that can be put in place to support people with disability and mental illness in the workplace
8795863 we also understand the urgent need to establish better data collection to help improve support services for people with disability and their family
8795864 last month federal state and territory ministers agreed to provide 6 5 million to enhance the abs survey of disability ageing and carers sdac including doubling the sample size which will significantly improve the collection of information in this important area
8795865 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road i will make certain those health care companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses

8795874 we had a very successful evening said capt cliff williams who spent several hours at the checkpoint with sgt richard langford eight officers a chp volunteer and a cadet from the ventura county sheriffs department
8795875 so this is not at the discretion of officers when traffic backs up they also let a bunch of cars go through unscreened to minimize inconvenience on drivers
8795876 one of the unusual things i found about sobriety checkpoints is that impaired drivers lack the necessary good judgment when theyre driving so they do strange things
8795877 oftentimes they dont pay attention so they still enter the checkpoint
8795878 although not recommended it is legal to drink and drive but its illegal to drive while youre under the influence of course that has a lot to do with the quantity of alcohol you ingested in a certain time period
8795879 buckle your seat belt so you have less chance of being hurt in a crash designate a sober driver to get everyone else home from a party dial 911 from your mobile phone to let us know about dangerous drivers on the road and well go right out after them
8795880 the goal for consumers and the rule that i follow at home is get recyclable material as clean and dry as you can
8795881 you need to make sure how youre recycling in your house is as easy and convenient as possible making it easy is what will make it successful
8795882 we found that when you split a truck the different sections of the truck dont fill up evenly
8795883 its not an efficient use of fuel to have a truck driving around full of trash but only half full of recyclables from a carbon footprint perspective its more efficient to run one type of material per truck
8795884 the golf tournament is our next big event and it is going to become a foundation committee event

8795907 travesty the trial of slobodan milosevic and the corruption of international justice
8795908 with international justice we are dealing with some of most fundamental questions of political life we are dealing with the questions of who makes the rules who has the right to rule and who adjudicates the rules these are the questions which go to the very essence of politics states are created around an agreement on who has the right to rule and who has the right to adjudicate and implement the rules
8795909 what is striking about these tribunals and their claim of right to rule is that they claim political power but at the same time they do not wish to assume any political responsibility when a state is created it affirms the right to rule the state has a control over its territory and thereby it has certain rights over the people who live on that territory but in retune for that right to rule it also undertakes obligations to protect the people who live there as a sort of contract between rulers and the ruled what i find unacceptable about the international tribunals is that they affirm the right to rule affirm the right to make rules to apply them and to adjudicate them but they dont take any corresponding obligations they dont take any obligation to protect or to govern in any way the peoples over whom they wield power
8795910 indeed it does adjudicate them and in many cases convicts them and sentences them but the yugoslav tribunal never bears any of the political consequences for the indictments that it issues or for the trials that it conducts
8795911 like all the international tribunals it is structurally separate from the people and the state over which it has power
8795912 the whole original purpose of the tribunal and the whole ideology behind it was that this was a war where crimes were being committed largely as they put it by the serbs

8795923 thousands of photos are sent to visa pour as proposals for exhibitions and evening programs and over the last two or three years these pictures have been increasingly neat and tidy increasingly standardized and to put it bluntly tedious with the same old stories seen from the same old angles and this tendency is getting even stronger
8795924 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8795925 this book had a good message about a girl trying to help a baby star i think this a nice theme in the book in that it is about humans interacting with nature the star i liked the cd since i work in a school we are always looking for books that are on tape or cd that can be read to kids that have a difficult time with reading i like that this product came with that it was also a nice visual to have to doll that came with it this provided different ways that the book can be used beyond just reading it to a child
8795926 the most positive characteristics of this book were the illustrations and the colors the book is so vibrant in color that it made you want to read i liked that it came with an audio cd i also liked that the book story had a positive message the nana star plushie was a nice add also to play along with the audio cd
8795927 the positive characteristics of this book is that it was a simple story of a topic children can relate to of being lost or not being able to find see someone they love some of the children talked about not seeing their grandma for long times and they seem to relate to nana
8795928 this is a great story to help children feel that they are never alone and are always being watched over
8795929 the characters in the story were cute and the illustrations were attractive and appealing to my children having the plush to go along with the book made it more fun for the children the story taught a lesson about fear and loneliness something everyone experiences at one time or another
8795930 this is a great story to help children feel that they are never alone and are always being watched over
8795931 we have been shushed our entire lives and wanted a place where we could be free to laugh out loud if we wanted
8795932 in fact the csa has 11 304 separated parents registered within cranbourne and surrounding areas
8795933 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer
8795934 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges well
8795935 its important for parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support
8795936 there will be free csa information booklets available about all aspects of separated parenting including maintaining a relationship with kids from a distance and tips and hints for people who are re partnering
8795937 we are looking forward to delivering a consistent crystal clear signal in the area

8795940 we want to break ground next spring and complete the first sound stage within the next year or so
8795941 i believe the council should do everything in its power to ensure that a project like this happens
8795942 it will definitively help the city ive seen many projects turned down and i hope the city wont pass this opportunity
8795943 if there is a downside to this i havent heard about it
8795944 were anxious to explore the possibilities the skys the limit
8795945 our chances are very good this year based on the fact that we are a very senior heavy team
8795946 i feel we should win league but im also confident we can win the whole thing
8795947 hes more of a leader hes our quarterback in the pool and he sees the playing field better than any kid ive ever coached
8795948 an exceptional player with tremendous speed and quickness who is extremely dangerous on counterattacks
8795949 i saw agoura play over the summer and i think theyre still the team to beat
8795950 they have some really great swimmers and p j iannone is one of the best players in the area
8795951 as good as kurzeka was we still needed other players such as matt carlson and casey sullivan to have spectacular seasons to win it all
8795952 this year is no different were going to need everyone to step up
8795953 agoura and royal are clearly the teams to beat but were hoping to give them a good run
8795954 once again id say its going to be a battle for us to try and get that third or fourth place spot we have a great group of guys that i believe can get us there
8795955 i expect him to step up and make a huge impact a lot of that has to do with his long arms hes not only able to shoot higher over defenders but hes also been also taking the ball away on defense too
8795956 bovard is going to be the main guy guarding our oppositions 2 meter men

8795960 i thought the race would have been close with a healthy edwards but now i feel its definitely our best shot weve had in the last eight years
8795961 i know i am biased but i feel gildea is one of the top runners in the area
8795962 hes very humble but hes also a very hard worker that rarely misses a practice hes like a coachs dream
8795963 my personal feeling is that it doesnt matter if edwards is out royals still the best
8795964 if edwards does it make it back near the end of the season then royals going to be real tough to beat
8795965 it seems every year we have some kind of injury before the season starts but we always tend to be all right and get that runner back when we need him
8795966 i know because of our eight titles in a row however that we do have a target on our back
8795967 we have three runners that are fighting hard to become the top runner on our squad
8795968 came in eighth place last year in league and just missed out on going to cif
8795969 he had a great season but i feel thats been a motivating factor for him this season
8795970 hes an unbelievable athlete and is much more relaxed this season with a year of varsity experience under his belt
8795971 which is not only necessary but essential for his defence

8795990 unions play such an important role for workers when we organize and when we collectively bargain we bring fairness to the workplace we achieve decent wages and working conditions for our members and that has the effect of raising the floor on wages and working conditions for all workers in the province
8795991 we also know that unions and their members do so much more for our wider communities through our volunteerism our work with the labour councils and through our partnership with the united way to name just a few union members love their province and they serve it with pride thats something to celebrate this labour day
8795992 unfortunately the sask party government has made it perfectly clear that they want to see unions disappear they passed a law bill 5 which totally undermines collective bargaining for public sector workers many of whom need these negotiations to keep up with the increases in the cost of living the other new sask party law bill 6 makes it extremely difficult to organize new unions that means no voice and no representation for saskatchewans most vulnerable workers what kind of government wants to attack the rights of the hard working citizens of this province
8795993 we are now engaged in a renewed struggle for the right to be union it may be technically legal to join a union and to be in a union but the core activities of what make us who we are collective bargaining and organizing have been decimated the new labour environment is tipped so heavily in favour of the bosses that workers will be hard pressed to keep up let alone make gains this labour day the sfl pledges to continue the fight for the right to be union well fight in the courts and as always well fight on the picket line and on the shop floor

8796023 the other thing that was really important to us from the beginning was that we wanted to give back to the community
8796024 and in particular we wanted to watch out for the environment
8796025 we think we have the same company values as microsoft
8796026 like them we believe in community so were a great example of a small company growing up with microsoft and microsoft technology
8796027 that was really great because time is always of the essence and theres never enough of it
8796028 this allowed me to have him focus on the food not on the technology
8796029 i think the reason microsoft stuck with me is that the products are already so familiar everybody uses them partly because they are so friendly and familiar

8796045 museum leaders cite its location as the primary reason for its troubles
8796046 its mean spirited and its beneath john mccain it is consistent with what karl rove is advising
8796047 its asking people to pay for something they can get for free
8796048 the letter implies they are going to do something for the fee the whole thing is an opportunist taking advantage of the public
8796049 mail the payment coupon with your processing fee of 171 on or before 09 05 2008 if the processing fee is not received by that date your application is subject to a 67 late fee
8796050 the letter looks so official i was thinking for the processing fee we would be eligible for a 501 reduction on our property taxes
8796051 the property value on our house was way off and the letter had a los angeles mailing address
8796052 this is definitely a con and a very clever one
8796053 i didnt send them any money so we werent harmed however its important to get the word out so other people arent harmed by it

8796063 the world exists only to the extent to which you participate in it
8796064 no it was capitalism more of it not less of naturally every political convention features its share of demagoguery but buried beneath the idealistic policy talk in denver is an ugly detail its about coercion
8796065 i have never been contacted by the mccain campaign at any point about the vp slot
8796066 i have never been asked for any information background etc so as i have said repeatedly in interviews i didnt consider myself to be under any consideration
8796067 i think people thought i was being coy and just not talking but i have built my political life on trying to shoot straight and tell it as it is and as i see it
8796068 i have been honest in telling you that i had no reason to believe i was ever seriously considered or
8796069 i hope it will be a person with a solid record and solid convictions on the foundation issues that bring many of us to the process
8796070 im taking this unusual step to communicate so it will come from me and not from some of the ridiculous things being said on tv and websites tonight
8796071 and he expects a ex senator who sat on his butt thru the state senate and only voted present who has sat thru the us senate and not even voted do anything to get his job back
8796072 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming because ive seen it because ive lived it
8796073 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8796074 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8796075 as president of the united states i will cut taxes for 95 percent of working families
8796076 he says he will chase bin laden to the gates of hell but wont go to the cave were he lives
8796077 if you dont know me by now you will never never know me
8796078 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8796079 so i have a solution to the health care crisis and it will cost not one thin dime
8796080 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care so there you have it voila problem solved
8796081 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care
8796082 they will have more than 85 000 people perhaps more than 90 000 people in this stadium by the time barack obama speaks
8796083 there is a concern that the obama campaign may have issued as many as 20 000 more tickets for this event
8796084 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8796085 i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest
8796086 instead im going to try to tell the american people what i believe will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testament to my patriotism
8796087 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
8796088 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders

8796093 and these people want us to turn over the security of the country to them
8796094 in closing mccain may have been a good soldier but hes no leader obamas a leader we will follow
8796095 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8796096 one top gop strategist told me privately that he thinks it will cost obama 4 6 points nationally
8796097 he has 300 foreign policy advisers and for his convention speech a football stadium equipped with a movie set that looks like a greek temple
8796098 he claims to be the one that we have been waiting for and he can lower the seas and promise and deliver universal love simply by showing up
8796099 why should anyone listen to the conservatives they overwhelmingly voted for the dumbest president on record
8796100 are they nominating a candidate or caesar the only thing thats missing is a laurel wreath
8796101 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8796102 for with what judgement you are judging you will be judged
8796103 if you dont quite understand what it is that obama offers this country if his past accomplishments dont give you a clue if youve not yet been able to distill from his speeches exactly what it is that we should
8796104 i may be fat but youre ugly so whats your excuse
8796105 im so much better looking than you so if im ugly you must be a hideous monstrosity
8796106 what am i doing im a fucking grown person acting like im 6

8796116 we know its not enough for a president to simply be a veteran
8796117 i dont think anybody thought wed be where we are today
8796118 nothing has been done in there for years and years and years you can hardly walk through it
8796119 the library will not be open on saturdays or sundays this fall
8796120 we dont know about the spring i think theyll reevaluate the situation after the semester and see where we are
8796121 the thinking is that the library gets more traffic during the week because thats when students are taking classes and most of them go to the library between or after their classes
8796122 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8796123 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8796124 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8796125 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8796126 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8796127 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8796128 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8796129 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8796130 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8796131 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8796132 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8796133 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8796134 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8796135 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8796136 it is a long fight and we grow weary of it sometimes until you see someone like obama and you say my journey my fight meant something because hes there
8796137 it will be like the end of that long hard journey for us and the beginning of a brighter future for not just african americans but for all of us
8796138 because he is recognizing that all of us no matter where we are in our life can identify with the message of hope and change
8796139 a lot of what i do is dedicated to a high school friend of mine who chose to go to mississippi and i did not
8796140 the lady said to me oh i didnt see you
8796141 being me i didnt get upset i just said very loudly oh i thought i stuck out like a sore thumb the place roared with laughter
8796142 ive got a surge of energy and hope by being here personally at this democratic convention and im rejuvenated behind this whole process
8796143 i actually teared up last night when joe biden was talking about his family
8796144 i just know what it would mean to them to know that im involved in this process not just for myself but for barack obama
8796145 theyd be proud of me theyd be proud of him
8796146 it appears right now at this time we only have one fatality the pilot that was on the aircraft
8796147 the pilot was the only person on board the aircraft
8796148 ive been waiting too long for a good candidate to run headlong into the issues that so many candidates run away from
8796149 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8796150 for all those people who said all obama does is talk about hope and doesnt talk about specifics barack obama just showed them how wrong they are
8796151 he showed he does have a plan and i think john mccain should be scared because i think we just listened to the next president of the united states
8796152 the girls are beautiful michelle is a sweetheart and the thing is this is just a real family a real real family
8796153 theres not a person here who wasnt touched by that speech
8796154 i decided even if i didnt get tickets i was coming anyway
8796155 found this topic looking for the same solution kujina you were right from the start i was able to change the default size in wp admin includes media php in the following section starting line 452
8796156 i look at blu ray being the obvious short term differentiator but if everything goes to digital download and over time it will then the blu ray device no longer has the same competitive advantage or the benefit is not as strong as the feature is
8796157 how realistic is that here we are this little company with 15 to 20 guys in cambridge massachusetts
8796158 to be sure article iv 2 of the treaty of amity directly benefits mckesson by declaring that property shall not be taken except for a public purpose nor shall it be taken without the prompt payment of just compensation mckesson contends that the treaty of amity creates a right property shall not be taken and provides a remedy just compensation and that together these make a cause of action not so the treaty of amity tells us what mckesson will receive money but leaves open the critical question of how mckesson is to secure its due for a federal court trying to decide whether to interject itself into international affairs the treaty of amitys silence on this point makes all the difference in the absence of a textual invitation to judicial participation we conclude the president and the senate intended to enforce the treaty of amity through bilateral interaction between its signatories
8796159 it doesnt suck as bad as i thought it would
8796160 purists are not going to like this and not everyone is going to like it
8796161 we are going to do our best to do it quickly and accurately
8796162 that is how many weve had so far and it will vary from year to year
8796163 when we come back with a ruling from video replay there is no argument unless it involves spectator interference and then the manager is entitled to an explanation
8796164 were only talking about home runs balls were not talking about plays at third base or balls and strikes or any of those things were just talking about a select portion of the game
8796165 sometimes with the configurations of these ballparks and so forth it makes it tough
8796166 im a throwback old baseball guy and i like the way that baseball is played and i like the part where the umpires decision held up and at the same time it didnt mean that they dont miss them and they dont get them right thats part of it
8796167 i think instant replay will definitely help that but i think it will take a little bit longer in the game and every year we go to spring training and the season starts and they always talk to us about shortening the time of the game
8796168 if they have to do a replay youre standing out there for five minutes doing nothing
8796169 they want to speed the game up make the call
8796170 the way they are building them now with all the angles its tougher to see what is going on
8796171 it doesnt really matter either way for me i hope it doesnt distract anything i hope they get the calls right
8796172 we see them all around town in the foothills mostly in the forest

8796202 brandeiss small size lends it a community feel and whenever you walk around campus you run into someone you know what drew me in is that brandeis students are very passionate about what they do whether in clubs or organizations there is always something going on students here are more politically aware than anyone else ive ever been exposed to and always take up different causes and have fundraisers and people genuinely care this extends to the classroom where students are very passionate and lectures are never boring
8796203 we have one faculty for every eight or nine students this makes possible a relationship between teachers and students which is unusual for a research university brandeis has a small student body and a first rate liberal arts curriculum in a large research university

8796246 the pain of rejection is generated almost entirely from overgeneralization in its absense a personal affront is temporarily disappointing but cannot be seriously disturbing a shy young man mustered up his courage to ask a girl for a date when she politely declined because of a previous engagement he said to himself im never going to get a date no girl would ever want a date with me ill be lonely and miserable all my life in his distorted cognitions he concluded that because she turned him down once she will always do so and that since all women have 100 percent identical tastes he would be endlessly and repeatedly rejected by any eligible woman on the face of the earth
8796247 three years after katrina i wanted to make a statement about the state of the clean up operation
8796248 i am delighted to be joining forces with colleagues and agencies in norfolk to ask people to call for the acceleration of the a11 dualling scheme
8796249 we are all anxious to do what we can to persuade the government to see sense and bring forward the scheme
8796250 it seems nonsensical to everyone involved in this campaign to delay the start any further particularly as one of the most difficult phases of agreeing the scheme is now complete
8796251 this scheme is very important for both norfolk and suffolk the current road is wholly inadequate creating intolerable problems for those who use it or live near it
8796252 we are grateful for the regions consideration of this scheme which confirms that this it a very high priority for the region and that they wish to see the scheme start as soon as possible suffolk homes

8796256 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8796257 i just think he doesnt know john mccain doesnt get it
8796258 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8796259 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8796260 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8796261 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8796262 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8796263 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8796264 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8796265 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind

8796268 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8796269 if im not here this computer will shut itself down

8796273 you cant talk to the hardware you have to talk to the os
8796274 its because i am in a leadership role and i will not subject my privates to undue influence
8796275 but if everybody in the platoon is voting for obama anyway and you are voting for obama then how can you exert undue influence
8796276 stop it i never said who i was voting for youre trying to use some kind of psychology trick on me
8796277 theyre still sending troops to iraq i thought the war was over
8796278 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8796281 let it be crystal clear that balochistan was never a part of pakistan trying to pakistanize balochistan at the gun point and through the slogan of allahu akbar has not worked for the last six decades and will not work in the future simply because the state of pakistan in itself is not a very legitimate state by herslf just because the majority of baloch are born muslim does not give the jihadi armies of pakistan and iran a license to continue to occupy our lands conduct genocide of our people loot and plunder our resources and test their nuclear weapons in balochistan the world community must not close their eyes over the crimes against secular baloch people
8796282 during talks at the summit we came to the conclusion that the global order should be respected and the country which unleashed aggression should be held responsible
8796283 the heads of sco states welcome moscows approval of the six principles of the south ossetian conflicts settlement and support russias active role in promoting peace and cooperation in this region
8796284 the chinese leadership called on russia and georgia to find a way to settle the dispute by negotiations
8796285 this is just about as far as official beijing can go in criticizing russia since both countries avoided criticizing each other during the last 20 years in fact the idea of scos founders in 1997 was to unite the countries fighting against terrorism separatism and other kinds of extremism this was a chinese idea not russian in this situation giving full support to abkhazia and south ossetia would be a loss of face for china
8796286 russia was angered by the western recognition of kosovo and china suspects the united states of secretly aiding the xinjiang separatists
8796287 china is also angered by the official support which the tibetan separatists got in some european capitals in this situation anger at the west may outweigh the fear of separatist precedents russia does not want to be in the situation of an honest loser which respects the territorial sovereignty of georgia when the west does not respect the territorial integrity of serbia and china may up to a certain point close its eyes to this kind of behavior from russia
8796288 it would be very nice if the russian peacekeeping contingent in south ossetia and abkhazia gained international status under the auspices of the csto
8796289 i would like to remind you that russian peacekeepers in georgia were moved in there under the mandate from the community of independent states cis the alliance of post soviet states where russia traditionally played the main role
8796290 the west just kept silent during the armed attack of georgia against south ossetias capital tskhinvali
8796291 this started the unhappy chain of events we all think that the subsequent actions of russia were aimed at protecting the population of that martyr city
8796292 to know where you are going you must know where you are from
8796293 when i work with my clients i like to give them a bigger picture of what entertainment arts represents in all of its science and artistic perspective as i work with 15 year new york asian teen artist element 5 e5 i dig a little bit into her history and navigate how her own past connects with the present state of entertainment now i provide her with the evolution of entertainment and music history so she can see the direction we are heading while observing the past music and the biz is ever changing in a cyclic loop

8796311 also plastic man is a character that i hate to say it but he needs star power to draw attention to his title and with ethans support and what he brings to the table thats the way to do the book but naturally with everything going on with the flash rebirth and other projects floating around its just a matter of time of getting into it more than anything else

8796335 the organiser was advised that no consent had been given and that the use of frinton greensward for the water fight was a contravention of the recreation ground byelaws
8796336 he was advised that should he go ahead and there were issues such as nuisance to others using the area damage to plants shrubs trees or property or litter left on the greensward the police would be entitled to take action under those byelaws
8796337 it was the organisers own decision to cancel the event
8796338 it would have been much better if the organiser had come to the council in the first place discussed his plans and we may have been able to suggest a more appropriate venue where it could be contained and have less impact on others
8796339 real madrid and barcelona are two of the most popular clubs in the world and were thrilled to be the exclusive canadian home of this top flight action

8796341 but now there are two special branches of salvation namely justification and sanctification and these being two different things faith acts upon christ for them in a different manner
8796342 and i call you brothers and sisters of the blood and the light because being connected as one we are all part of the oneness of the light the light is also part of the light blood and the life blood of souls such as us and so i call you my brothers and my sisters of the blood my name is aerial hawk or desert hawk my medium did have trouble with the name aerial hawk by way of explanation i gave him my name which is a common simple translation of my tribal name desert hawk there are many others like me children of the desert and i speak of the arizona desert hot dry parched and yet it sustained us for many years for many generations the sustenance is still there the sustenance remains the knowledge of how to live within that harsh environment is carried as a memory in the dna of those of our bloodline who came after us many many generations after us i was named after the desert hawk which has the ability to rise high up upon thermal updrafts it is soars it glides and it floats at the top of the updraft of the hot desert air heights that people standing upon this earth would consider being of enormous dimensions and so i was named the aerial hawk the desert hawk because it was foreseen by our shaman that the soul of the true being that i am that i was was a soul that was destined to fly to fly free unfettered and high to reach and attain heights rarely attained by other members of my tribe and so i was to be a way shower to show the way the spiritual way how to walk the spiritual pathway in complete and total harmony with our environment which appeared to you europeans to be harsh and unforgiving and yet many many generations of us lived survived and thrived in that desert environment because we knew the secret the secret not only of how to live and survive and how to go forward and expand but to thrive without compromising any of our belief systems or way of life the desert provided many types of food for us the europeans were not able to see these foods they remained unseen and were only to be seen by those who had the eyes to see the ability to see and that ability was passed down to us bred into us by our ancestors many peoples to this day could learn from us they could learn how we survived they could learn the secret of surviving and i am talking about surviving in total harmony with your surroundings the secret to which is simplicity our needs were very simple our needs were catered for our needs were met not just by the great spirit but by the knowledge given us by the great spirit on how to appeal to the mother earth and ask for sustenance ask her to supply what we needed we did not have a great variety of foods but we did have adequate adequate sufficient we knew not the word gluttony gluttony is an anathema to my people of many many generations we survived we survived because our needs were very few we took what was given what was offered and no more than that we took food from the land at the time of its ripeness and not a day before or a day after there is a time there is a timing for everything and the gathering of food was also governed by time the timing of the gathering of the food was calculated so that we may collect all of the abundance of it when that abundance was at its most prolific and nutritious stage we had our ceremonies we had our ceremonies to honour mother earth we had ceremonies to honour the animal life the plant life the desert sands and what the desert sands surrendered up to us life was not spartan life was lived simply quietly peacefully and in total harmony with the all we confined our activities and our work to a very few hours each day so as to allow each and every tribal member the maximum amount of time to sit to go within and to commune with the great spirit to give thanks and to appeal to our ancestors and to give thanks person to person to our ancestors for all of the knowledge that they not only passed down to us but the knowledge guidance and the advice that they gave to us from their exalted position in the land of spirit we spent many of our hours singly in family groups in groups of various families and as a complete tribe communing with the great spirit because it was the strength of this communication that was our lifeline without the knowledge and the advice without that very important lifeline we would never have survived and that was the secret that the europeans did not know they could not and would not understand and even if they did understand they gave no credence to such things they only knew the greed and the gluttony of the material world what the europeans saw and what we saw were two diametrically opposed views i do not need to tell you whose vision was the correct one my tribe and all of the ancestors and descendents of my tribe are the chiricahua we were the chiricahua apache proud yet noble our life was never dull it was never without substance and was filled with the abundance of love at times dictated by the position of the sun as it aligned with other planets oh yes we were very much aware of the movements of the planets and because the sun governed so much of our lifestyle and our way of life we worshipped the sun because that physical sun that bright light that planet which emits tremendous heat and light was the physical representation of the great central sun the spiritual sun and it was the great central sun that was the heart and the soul of our complete being ness we had our ceremonies which were colourful they happy and they were respectful at times when we performed the sun dance during the ceremony of the sun it was a time of meeting and matching of our younger males and females and it was at such ceremonies that the courting of the males and females took place at a later time during the time of the sun ceremony the bonding of the couples the marriage of those couples took place after the sacred ceremonies were observed we would have our feasting which a limited food was feasting we would have a beverage made from the desert pear the prickly desert pear the beverage made from the desert pear became not only our holy nectar it became our celebratory nectar similar in manner to which your alcoholic drinks are consumed during your ceremonies on this day the present population of this earth would be well served and well rewarded if they were to follow our lead there is more than ample food and water to sustain not only your existing population but a great many more souls if the people of earth ate and drank sparingly trusted that the abundance would always be there discontinued their greedy hoarding and withholding of foods and resources there would be more available for everybody in previous times of uncertainty we survived we went deeper into the desert and we not only survived but we multiplied into your future in various places on your earth there will be some difficulty experienced with the supply and availability of food there will be foodstuffs that will be hoarded that will be withheld from you they will be many items of food that will become scarce and very expensive to purchase as a result of the greed exhibited by those who are of wealth and power there will be many who will struggle for the basics of survival but please hear my words hear and heed my words listen to the secret the secret is to take and use only what you need store some foods hoard no foods the abundance is always there the great spirit will always guarantee abundance but you must seek it seek and find simplify your needs not at this very moment in time but as things become more difficult then you shall simplify your needs and take only what you require those who have the smallest need will survive quite modestly and comfortably and that is the secret you do not require very much at all your few needs will be supplied they will be there and they will be adequate i thank you for hearing my words in your heart in the name of the great central sun i ask that you be showered with golden light i wish you peace and harmony i shall now withdraw and return to my home in the desert where i belong desert hawk thanks you

8796361 die pin gruppe und ihre tochtergesellschaften k mpfen seit ende vergangenen jahres ums berleben nachdem die eigent mer des konzerns darunter mit geringen anteilen die holtzbrinck gruppe tagesspiegel zeit wegen des post mindestlohns nicht mehr bereit waren weiteres geld bereitzustellen
8796362 pin hatte die idee das briefmonopol der post in deutschland zu brechen dann beschloss die bundesregierung einen mindestlohn f r briefzusteller der pin allein in diesem jahr 35 bis 45 millionen euro zus tzlich kosten sollte zu viel f r das junge unternehmen

8796383 i do think it will keep those marginal buyers out
8796384 many people like the idea of having someone else in their home for company
8796385 i have always had foreign students mainly girls and mainly from asia
8796386 i got the idea to have students come here when one of my daughter heathers friends was doing a co op program and stayed here i put an ad in the newspaper but after that i always had young people coming and wanting to stay here
8796387 i interview the students and i dont have a lease
8796388 if they dont want to be here then they shouldnt they cook for themselves and clean up and they use my kitchen sometimes we eat together and i get to try some unusual things to eat
8796389 i let them have their friends over and have parties and even though they have tv in their rooms they sometimes come and watch with me
8796390 the students i have had have tremendous respect for others and are very gracious and generous
8796391 my company told me that my family probably wouldnt sue me if they fell on the ice but someone not related might the extra insurance probably costs about 25 a year
8796392 most of the furniture i bought was used from people downsizing or moving two homes into one i have bought some linens but not that much a set of sheets maybe for each bed
8796393 there are organizations attached to all the universities that are geared to student housing
8796394 provided the accommodation is within a certain price range homeowners can advertise free on their websites i think it is a very good idea to use this kind of help when buying a house
8796395 you cant run around in the nude or bicker with your husband i would say it is not something to do only because of dire financial need you have to be ready and able to enjoy the company and the process
8796396 andrea palladio actually never wrote about this type of opening although he illustrated it on the woodcut elevations of his basilica in downtown vicenza
8796397 its the first urban park in the city of vaughan and the first new park to be built in the ward in over 10 years

8796399 king is so lovely and i wanted really to complement the location more than anything
8796400 i wanted the warmth of that lake district home because i thought it really suited king city
8796401 the classic georgian country house is a beautiful thing but its more formal than i wanted to achieve
8796402 living in it is what tells you what to do
8796403 we have dinner parties so we have a formal dining room and we think thats very important
8796404 its had quite the impact on family life when you have teenagers its really important to have everyone coming together
8796405 i grew up in those west coast houses with all the windows we have light coming in all day from somewhere
8796406 im from the rain forest and when i look out the window i love to see green

8796413 a leitura transformou se de instrumento de lazer em pe a de uma engrenagem utilizada para compensar as ang stias de um mundo normalizado individualista e competitivo
8796414 john edwards has repeatedly apologized for his conduct and deeply regrets any damage or stress this has caused his family his friends and his supporters but its important to remember that while he makes no excuse for his personal mistakes mr edwards has selflessly served his country for decades and it is this unwavering commitment to making america a better place that we should place our focus
8796415 i cannot sympathise with that it is too ugly too horrible too distressing there is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain one should sympathise with the colour the beauty the joy of life the less said about lifes sores the better

8796419 toyota are good at making money but theyre no good at making sports cars
8796420 an increasing willingness to allow the actions of individuals to disadvantage and even endanger others if those actions derive from religious faith
8796421 its a great opportunity for time warner to partner with the bills to create an environment that fans can come to have state of the art technology enjoy a football game its exciting
8796422 i was behind him back in the recesses of the lincoln memorial itself
8796423 to tell you the truth i was more fascinated by the crowds than the speakers because it seemed almost inconceivable that we had succeeded in bringing this many people to washington
8796424 it is a blistering hot day people are passing out all over we were just in front of the reflecting pool and crowded in but everybody when they took out their food shared food with whoever was sitting near
8796425 there were tremendous fear from conservative and liberal supporters of the march that there might be violence
8796426 he was he brought his a game and god put his a spirit in him that day and he spoke to the world
8796427 barack obama is a certain part of the dream when he announced for president i had already signed on for hillarys campaign
8796428 i knew hillary from the white house and i kept saying to myself and to other people that my head is with hillary but my heart is with obama
8796429 forty five years ago we had a candidate it was freedom now they have a real live breathing candidate its barack obama forty five years ago we were them and 45 years later they are us
8796430 i think he would be just as awestruck awestricken as i
8796431 he would be pleased that weve moved one place that he called us to go to judge our children by the content of their character and not the color of their skin
8796432 if there is someone who wore fate on his sleeve it is barack obama
8796433 you could see it happen you could feel it it was a matter of time
8796434 a leader that god has blesses us with at this time
8796435 barry was given a lesson that he would consume over and over his unique racial ancestry made him someone who certainly was not to be ostracized or shunned
8796436 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8796437 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8796438 this is more a testament to our nation and our achievements than to any one individual it should give everyone in here a sense of how awesome it is to be an american
8796439 were finally as americans given a chance to vote for someone whos going to embody equality
8796440 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8796441 i came to congress with a simple mandate from my constituents lower the amount of wasteful government spending
8796442 rising costs of living including gasoline and food reinforce the need to reduce unnecessary and duplicative federal spending and keeping the tax burden low on illinois hard working families
8796443 republicans and democrats alike have spent years wasting taxpayer dollars but the american people have awakened
8796444 now is the time not tomorrow to hold the line on government spending
8796445 taxpayers would be wise to hang onto their wallets and demand that congress refocus its priorities and cut wasteful spending
8796446 hmmm i wonder if i can join the guitar lesson today and i need 100 for that

8796449 we are with you its worth it its worth it let us together usher his kingdom to earth
8796450 umm jesse are you sure you dont have any other sons
8796451 barack obamas convention line up contradicts the fresh washington outsider change message he has been touting since the democratic primaries and caucuses
8796452 sen barack obama sought more than 3 4 million in congressional earmarks for clients of the lobbyist son of his democratic running mate sen joseph r biden jr of delaware records show
8796453 senator joe biden may be one of the only u s politicians that can get iraqs feuding sunni shiite and kurdish politicians to agree but not in a good way
8796454 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics
8796455 this is the first ill vote for a republican president or work for one
8796456 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given they have created the space for political reconciliation
8796457 ive never seen anything like this i cant imagine anybody else attracting such a remarkable crowd
8796458 its what senator obama said yesterday its not a bunch of party contributors and party regulars this is the people coming out to support someone they think is going to change the world
8796459 hes had to align himself with the right wing of the party and most of us are centrists
8796460 i think its too much its a zoo a circus
8796461 this is supposed to be about business the greatest business in the world we dont need all these people here a lot of them arent even going to vote for obama they just wanted free tickets to this thing
8796462 using a venue like this opens things up so people can participate on a wider basis
8796463 i think obama has brought kids in women in and thats where the future is its not just people in smoke filled rooms
8796464 i think its going to be like nothing weve ever experienced
8796465 we have had bigger events in denver still this is a great day
8796466 african americans will be watching tonight just like we did when the temptations were first on the ed sullivan show just like we did when joe louis won championships thats what tonight reminds me of
8796467 the big uncertainty was whether he could meet the high expectations set by his 2004 speech
8796468 but with a crowd cheering every paragraph it is clear that he roused the faithful and excited people all across america he delivered an inspiring speech that got his general election campaign off to a great start
8796469 nothing like this has been seen in modern times of the party and i think its a moment for change
8796470 he proved tonight he is tough enough to run for president he created the vision of where he wanted the country to go and how he wanted to take it
8796471 it was absolutely the most moving thing i stood there with tears coming down my face
8796472 i really feel like i know who he is he is a warm caring human being
8796473 the way he was brought up obviously makes his family very important to him
8796474 hes going to make a difference that its not the same half baked excuses hes going to get us out of the war
8796475 it anticipated and pre empted every argument mccain and the republicans have and will make against him
8796476 the speech and the entire convention could not possibly have been more effective
8796477 hes masterful charismatic i hope the democrats have the organization to pull it off
8796478 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8796479 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8796480 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
8796481 so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8796482 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8796483 i believe this election is so close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change represents
8796484 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back
8796485 pana acum ziarele au sugerat ca intre moda si finante nu ar putea exista decat o singura legatura tinerele pasionate de moda au nevoie de manageri in finante cu salarii suficient de mari incat sa le satisfaca apetitul pentru produse de lux

8796489 be open to the miracles that life throws at you
8796490 i was teaching in california and somehow i fell into administration it seemed quite natural
8796491 i took a deep breath when i was offered this position
8796492 i would love hawaiianuiakea to be seen not only in hawaii but internationally as a leader in indigenous knowledge a leader in creating healthy strong and vibrant communities and a leader in language and culture
8796493 for hawaiians we go back to maoli our stories that can tell us where we came from and what we value if you can go back to that source collectively then the answers and direction become clear
8796494 when i moved to michigan state university i was the only female of color and the only junior professor i sat around the table with white men who were all full professors with long careers
8796495 i had to learn how to approach each of them from who i am i am a kanaka maoli woman a scholar a wife they had to learn that
8796496 the same is true for when i come back home i need to take time to tell people who i am and what i believe in
8796497 i believe she will be able to bring all that she has learned from those experiences and enrich our school
8796498 she is very balanced in both cultural and spiritual matters as well as in academics and administration
8796499 i always think that you stand on the shoulders of those who have come before you and you better hope like hell that you do well because they are watching you
8796500 so many wonderful people such as haunani kay trask lilikala kameeleihiwa and jon osorio have really shaped our school
8796501 they are pioneers in hawaiian studies they have created an environment in which we can not only learn about our hawaiian culture but we can see it smell it taste it touch it hear it and live it
8796502 but as john updike put it if there is no god then the universe is a freak show and i do not experience it as a freak show though i have had neither the maleficent nor the beatific vision i have heard whispers from the wings of the stage
8796503 we need to boil that down we need to figure what changes have to be made to accommodate the concerns that are raised
8796504 young people today are not used to quite frankly some of the demands and the rigours and the discipline that is expected in the canadian forces
8796505 requiring young people to comply with strict military doctrine and discipline is a greater challenge today quite frankly than it was 10 or 15 or 25 years ago
8796506 undefined christianity is not a problem in our generation it is defined christianity that brings the rub
8796507 were supporting two communities what could be better than that
8796508 its great theres a lot of pride in what we do we just have a great time doing it and theres tremendous results
8796509 we are moving towards a new album said switzer whose day job is with the charlottetown harbour authority
8796510 we have quite a few songs that are taking shape that wed have some interest in recording
8796511 i dont know how to put it into words i called the guys and asked them if they were interested and they said interested of course well be there
8796512 were definitely getting quite a bit busier lately switzer said
8796513 were looking at having an outside producer come in we havent approached any to date we want to get the demos in place and see where were at with it but were definitely looking at having an outside set of ears come in for the project
8796514 come i will show you around and explain what needs to be done
8796515 if youre going to get into racing you better get used to loosing look at fangio statistically hes the best there ever was this was years before schumacher and he only won 3 outa ten times he tried so even if youre that good which i doubt what your going to be doing most of the time is loosing

8796517 essas reuni es conseguiram chamar a aten o dos pa ses para o tema do meio ambiente mas n o tiveram efeito no que diz respeito gera o de pol ticas p blicas que levassem em considera o seus resultados globais elas deram in cio a um imenso trabalho mundial de constru o de mecanismos para assegurar uma compatibiliza o entre o meio ambiente e o desenvolvimento econ mico
8796518 gostaria de manifestar meu agrado por ver a fapesp como sempre na lideran a no apoio a pesquisas cient ficas no estado de s o paulo desejo que os pesquisadores paulistas e do brasil se lancem com afinco para ajudar os governantes a tomar as melhores decis es
8796519 com essa base cient fica que poder ajudar no enriquecimento da consci ncia sobre o tema o processo de compreens o dos efeitos do aquecimento global e a redu o dos riscos que envolvem a emiss o de gases do efeito estufa certamente ter o um avan o grande
8796520 muitas pessoas olham para os resultados do ipcc painel intergovernamental de mudan as clim ticas e t m a impress o de que o assunto das mudan as clim ticas est em discuss o apenas nas ltimas d cadas o que n o verdade a comunidade cient fica vem construindo esse conhecimento h pelo menos 200 anos motivada pela curiosidade e para tornar a humanidade mais s bia foi uma evolu o social n o teve um nico pesquisador que descobriu o aquecimento global e tamb m n o ser s um que apontar as solu es
8796521 queremos juntar e estimular a comunidade cient fica para que ela trabalhe da maneira mais articulada poss vel de tal modo que a troca de informa es permita avan ar em quest es como as conseq ncias das mudan as clim ticas globais no funcionamento dos ecossistemas
8796522 n o estamos lan ando um programa para resolver o problema das mudan as clim ticas e sim para descobrir conhecimentos que ajudar o a humanidade a trat lo melhor por diferentes meios a expectativa do programa mobilizar pesquisadores de v rias reas desde as ci ncias exatas e da natureza at as ci ncias humanas para que essa fertiliza o cruzada de id ias gere novas descobertas
8796523 conseq ncias das mudan as clim ticas globais no funcionamento dos ecossistemas com nfase em biodiversidade e nos ciclos de gua carbono e nitrog nio
8796524 balan o de radia o na atmosfera aeross is gases tra o e mudan as dos usos da terra
8796525 mudan as clim ticas globais e agricultura e pecu ria
8796526 essa primeira chamada bem abrangente porque a id ia compor uma base mais geral de projetos desde os aspectos f sicos e qu micos at as dimens es humanas efeitos antropog nicos e quest es institucionais relacionados s mudan as clim ticas esperamos que os pesquisadores consigam gerar boa ci ncia que leve o brasil a ter uma participa o mais efetiva no debate cient fico mundial das mudan as clim ticas
8796527 a id ia criar um modelo pr prio um programa de computador com caracter sticas e interesses regionais para n o ficarmos dependentes dos modelos desenvolvidos em outros pa ses que tamb m s o muito teis na segunda chamada diferentemente da primeira iremos selecionar um nico projeto cujo objetivo seja contribuir para o desenvolvimento de um modelo num rico brasileiro do sistema clim tico global para ser utilizado em estudos de mudan as clim ticas globais e regionais
8796528 o brasil contribui com cerca de 1 5 dos artigos cient ficos sobre mudan as clim ticas e s o paulo produz um ter o disso trata se de uma contribui o respeit vel mas temos diversos desafios pela frente e o programa ser fundamental para enfrent los
8796529 ainda n o temos dados suficientes sobre a rela o da mudan a clim tica com o aumento das chuvas e dos extremos de precipita o acima de 20 mil metros
8796530 tamb m h necessidade de mais estudos para entender o aumento das descargas el tricas que em s o paulo por exemplo passaram de uma m dia de 6 mil no fim dos anos 1950 para 10 mil hoje o que representa um aumento de 30 a cada grau a mais na temperatura
8796531 h muitos desafios como entender as causas das mudan as clim ticas e conhecer melhor os ciclos biogeoqu micos e biogeof sicos precisamos de modelos clim ticos regionais com desenvolvimento de softwares brasileiros vamos ter que estudar tamb m como mitigar as emiss es quais s o as principais vulnerabilidades s mudan as clim ticas e como aumentar a capacidade adaptativa
8796532 temos pouqu sssimo monitoramente do pl ncton por exemplo que afeta toda a cadeia alimentar marinha n o temos invent rios brasileiros que permitam a cria o de sistemas de alerta para termos capacidade de reagir s altera es
8796533 ser preciso saber como modelar invas es de novas esp cies sabemos que das 100 esp cies invasoras consideradas piores a am rica latina j tem a ocorr ncia de 55
8796534 esse tipo de projeto tem ainda a vantagem da intera o com a popula o o que tem um papel pedag gico
8796535 a perda de esp cies causa um efeito cascata e os ecossistemas v o perdendo capacidade de reagir o pfpmcg ajudar a interferir nesse processo fornecendo dados ambientais biol gicos e sociais que se forem integrados ser o importantes na elabora o e montagem de hip teses
8796536 quando olhamos os resultados de 20 modelos diferentes usados para tra ar cen rios clim ticos todos de alta robustez publicados em revistas indexadas vemos que h variabilidade em um fator de 30 vezes isso evidencia que nosso grau de desconhecimento sobre componentes cr ticos para as mudan as clim ticas muito grande
8796537 temos a um campo de pesquisa promissor o desmatamento por exemplo pode aumentar ou diminuir a precipita o dependendo da escala preciso entender esses processos
8796538 a incerteza relativa aos gases de efeito estufa pequena mas muito grande no caso do efeito dos aeross is por causa do nosso desconhecimento cient fico sobre essa quest o
8796539 o estudo mostra que com o aumento de dois graus cent grados o plantio de ma s seria inviabilizado em santa catarina mas pela mesma raz o o estado poderia plantar banana mais estudos v o apontar esse tipo de alternativa econ mica
8796540 j a cultura da cana de a car seria beneficiada ela sofreria um deslocamento para o sul e poderia ser plantada em 2 6 mil munic pios contra os 1 6 mil atuais s o paulo seria o estado mais beneficiado
8796541 mas o pa s ficaria seriamente vulner vel em termos de seguran a alimentar
8796542 muitos cientistas sociais passaram a estudar quest es relacionadas ao meio ambiente mas os paradigmas usados para esses estudos n o contemplaram as mudan as clim ticas globais
8796543 at a linguagem sofreu modifica es em rela o aos relat rios anteriores se antes se falava em mitiga o e modelos come ou se a falar tamb m em vulnerabilidade e adapta o
8796544 um campo que gera necessidade de profundos estudos para os cientistas sociais que t m um acervo de conhecimento sobre essas quest es
8796545 quando as ci ncias humanas contemplam a perspectiva de longo prazo geralmente focam o passado as an lises de longo prazo focadas no futuro s o menosprezadas vistas como exerc cio de futurologia mas tendo disposi o cen rios cientificamente embasados ser poss vel trabalhar nisso esses cen rios no entanto precisam ser regionalizados para que os cientistas sociais tenham uma base concreta
8796546 contribuir para a forma o de uma cultura que defenda valores atitudes e pr ticas sociais que respeitem os direitos dos cidad os em todos os espa os da sociedade
8796547 se analisarmos as vilas medievais m dias ou as p lis gregas veremos que a maioria tinha uma escala semelhante que era encontrada na floresta amaz nica
8796548 algumas das pr ticas que esses antigos habitantes utilizavam podem ajudar a desenvolver formas de implantar solu es de desenvolvimento sustent vel
8796549 n o s o cidades mas se trata de urbanismo constru do em torno de vilas
8796550 isso derruba modelos que sugerem que estamos olhando para uma biodiversidade original

8796555 i strongly oppose retroactive immunity in the fisa bill ever since 9 11 this administration has put forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand the fisa court works the separation of power works we can trace track down and take out terrorists while ensuring that our actions are subject to vigorous oversight and do not undermine the very laws and freedom that we are fighting to defend no one should get a free pass to violate the basic civil liberties of the american people not the president of the united states and not the telecommunications companies that fell in line with his warrantless surveillance program we have to make clear the lines that cannot be crossed that is why i am co sponsoring senator dodds amendment to remove the immunity provision secrecy must not trump accountability we must show our citizens and set an example to the world that laws cannot be ignored when it is inconvenient a grassroots movement of americans has pushed this issue to the forefront you have come together across this country you have called upon our leaders to adhere to the constitution you have sent a message to the halls of power that the american people will not permit the abuse of power and demanded that we reclaim our core values by restoring the rule of law its time for washington to hear your voices and to act i share your commitment to this cause and will stand with you in the fights to come and when i am president the american people will once again be able to trust that their government will stand for justice and will defend the liberties that we hold so dear as vigorously as we defend our security

8796557 you have to understand most of these people are not ready to be unplugged and many of them are so inert so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it
8796558 you know john mccain likes to say hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave in which he lives
8796559 i dont want to fear america i want to respect it
8796560 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8796561 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives

8796564 does he have experience nobody thinks he does does he i dont want my president out of control
8796565 so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8796566 if you dont have a record to run on you scare the folks
8796567 explain why it makes sense to support government when it shoots people who disagree try not paying your taxes and see what happens
8796568 ok if you break the law and then break the law again and attempt to escape a prison likely by endangering someone in some way you could be injured
8796569 im john mccain and i approved this attack on my opponents patriotism but if he says anything bad about my lack of a plan for americas future then i was a pow and he is a terrorist

8796580 the economy grew faster than expected last spring but this does not mean our economy is on the right track
8796581 the weak dollar is helping exporters and boosting gdp but families continue to face rising joblessness smaller paychecks and higher prices at the gas pump and the grocery store to get families back on track we need an economic stimulus plan that focuses on getting aid to the states and an energy plan that promotes green jobs and ends our dependence on foreign oil

8796586 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given they have created the space for political reconciliation
8796587 i have the kleenex box ready because it should be very emotional
8796588 as a christian i have seen it repeated that evangelical christians are required to vote republican when i heard baracks call to renewal speech i was surprised this is change i can believe in and many other young evangelical christians can believe in too for the first time in my life i got hooked on politics
8796589 were expecting between 15 to 30 people to come and well be ready with registration lists and stickers to pass out
8796590 i have never been involved in politics in any way shape or form
8796591 i was surprised to find myself supporting a democrat id always figured myself to be a republican just because my family was
8796592 the link between our countrys lack of an effective energy policy and our flawed foreign policy
8796593 i would love to be a part of this historical event its so long overdue
8796594 we do it this way because weve always done it this way
8796595 hard work tenacity preparation and faith are at risk today

8796601 when the flecktones first got together we worked out a christmas medley it was really fun people loved it and we continued to play it every year
8796602 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8796603 let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey and especially the one who traveled the farthest
8796604 to the love of my life our next first lady michelle obama and to sasha and malia i love you so much and im so proud of all of you
8796605 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8796606 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8796607 thats why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8796608 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8796609 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8796610 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8796611 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8796612 this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio on the brink of retirement finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work
8796613 this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment hes worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to china and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news
8796614 we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
8796615 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8796616 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8796617 the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives
8796618 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8796619 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8796620 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8796621 well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
8796622 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8796623 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma
8796624 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8796625 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8796626 because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan i see my grandfather who signed up after pearl harbor marched in pattons army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill
8796627 in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift i think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships
8796628 when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed
8796629 and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business i think about my grandmother who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman
8796630 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8796631 its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
8796632 its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road
8796633 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves
8796634 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8796635 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
8796636 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8796637 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8796638 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8796639 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8796640 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8796641 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8796642 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8796643 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8796644 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8796645 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy
8796646 now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american
8796647 now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent
8796648 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses and the time to protect social security for future generations
8796649 and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons
8796650 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8796651 and democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8796652 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8796653 and just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home so must we keep americas promise abroad if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8796654 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8796655 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has a 79 billion surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8796656 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8796657 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying iraq
8796658 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8796659 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8796660 these are the policies i will pursue and in the weeks ahead i look forward to debating them with john mccain
8796661 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8796662 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8796663 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8796664 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
8796665 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk
8796666 and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know
8796667 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8796668 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8796669 for eighteen long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past
8796670 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8796671 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
8796672 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8796673 and it is that promise that forty five years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8796674 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred
8796675 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8796676 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8796677 algo a tener en cuenta es que los comentarios que contengan enlaces con invitaciones a registrarse al mismo tema que propone mas efectivo son considerados como spam
8796678 that red phone boxes do not disappear into the great gray blur of the modern british streetscape
8796679 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8796680 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8796681 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8796682 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8796683 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8796684 some of them were killed when trees fell on their houses
8796685 the government absolutely rejects any act of violence related to criminal events even when it is carried out between members of criminal organizations
8796686 the director has left himself room to widen out the investigation and i suspect that is whats going to happen
8796687 weve had so many instances now where winston peters version of events just doesnt stack up with the version of events presented by others
8796688 really the call we made on wednesday to effectively cut winston peters and new zealand first loose wasnt a call we made easily or lightly we did it with the full knowledge it may well cost national an opportunity to be in government
8796689 i would find it enormously difficult trusting the word of winston peters
8796690 the injuries suffered by this man are horrific extreme violence has been used it is among the worst beatings that i have seen for a long time
8796691 we dont expect any interruptions to electricity supply however we are currently moving some additional equipment to the site as well as inspecting the transmission lines in the vicinity via helicopter to ensure that there are no other instances like this one
8796692 this unlevels the playing field and gives certain traders advantages over others
8796693 other banks may be harmed other people who are marketmakers are going to be discouraged from providing liquidity there could be circumstances under which jpmorgan could use that information to profit
8796694 from now on i would say he shukhman no longer gets to trade in front of someone onscreen
8796695 it compromises the integrity and weakens our other clients confidence in us in screen i mean you cant expect other traders to put themselves at risk if they see someone else allowed to break the rules
8796696 we basically counted on him shukhman to help our biz in indices and it didnt work and pissed off a lot of other supporters who are more loyal
8796697 what happened to all the petty cash we had in the safe
8796698 was only 400 in safe and we used it to acquire marching powder for our nites out
8796699 the cds market is hardly transparent and the fact that dealers the brokers clients demand more information from the marketplace than is visibly available comes as no surprise
8796700 outside of managing counterparty exposures and limits there is no meaningful advantage to knowing who is on the other side of a cds bid or offer prior to trade
8796701 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8796702 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8796703 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8796704 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
8796705 theres a lot of personality infused in just the design alone
8796706 you always do a great job i love reading all your stuff
8796707 nobody had the courage to tell me in front of my face that my proposal wasnt going forward

8796713 when you are a good musician you hear when it sounds false
8796714 i think i hear in the voices when people are lying
8796715 if you cannot multitask or communicate without being passive aggressive dont even bother replying
8796716 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8796717 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8796718 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8796719 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
8796720 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you
8796721 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
8796722 i hope she likes it here i sent the ad to one of my old sitters and she said she felt it was pretty accurate which sort of stung a little bit
8796723 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8796724 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife
8796725 this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8796726 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaus of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaus at risk of closure
8796727 you can slim it down to one bureau in canberra covering everything but you end up diminishing the analysis of the democratic process and very seriously so
8796728 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed
8796729 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life
8796730 he could also have been killed by one of the spikes
8796731 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8796732 he made it a point of saying very clearly that
8796733 he said it simply and clearly so republicans could not characterize him as a democrat who was going to raise taxes
8796734 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8796735 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8796736 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address these matters expeditiously
8796737 mr peters is offering his total cooperation to the sfo and the first meeting between his lawyers and the office will take place tomorrow morning
8796738 are you saying i should deny giving a donation to nz first when i did
8796739 were not removing anyone from the business fundamentally associated with the sub editing of the front of the book news sport or business but rather the inserted tabloid sections
8796740 its a voluntary redundancy program although we reserve the right to move to compulsory if we dont get the numbers
8796741 well reserve our rights on all of that and well make decisions as things evolve
8796742 that sort of decline needs to be addressed it cant go on
8796743 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8796744 this coexistence is an exotic superconducting state that has not been observed in any other superconducting material
8796745 it shows a very strong link between superconductivity and magnetism
8796746 its not clear what the origin of this state is or what creates or modifies it
8796747 its really a question of the chicken and the egg
8796748 does superconductivity need magnetism in this state or does magnetism need superconductivity
8796749 this is a new paradigm for understanding the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity
8796750 it could help us find the basis for understanding unconventional high temperature superconductivity
8796751 it seems that mr mitchell enjoyed making jokes at the expense of his employee mr cunningham but did not find it so funny when it came to receiving advice that legal action might be taken against him
8796752 he claimed he no longer manufactured the drug as he wasnt very good at doing it and the chemicals were too hard to come by
8796753 you should be aware that the fact is has been requested does not indicate what the outcome will necessarily be

8796756 his thoughts tumbled in his head making and breaking alliances like underpants in a dryer without cling free
8796757 on life with bonnie i had that family life and i had the talk show life and my writing partner don lake and i gravitated more and more to the talk show aspect of the show because its where we felt more comfortable because of our improvisational backgrounds
8796758 i was given the great gift of an incredibly healthy perspective of having spent time with people in the most intimate and vulnerable time of their lives
8796759 i was truly blessed with having done that first in my life before getting into show business
8796760 i have a great affinity for senior citizens i worked at a nursing home though high school theres a lost appreciation for a generation that has so much to tell us when were so full of self help books and doctors on tv
8796761 and as long as my mom is still around i still do stuff that pleases my mother
8796762 shes very self deprecating and i think that makes her so accessible
8796763 whats important is dropping out of the top 10 or the top 20
8796764 to be 21 or 24 probably doesnt make a whole lot of difference
8796765 marketing is much more sophisticated for most companies than basing ad buys on market rank
8796766 advertisers are more likely to look at current sales in a market what opportunities for growth there are and those wont be based on whether portland has 10 000 more homes than pittsburgh
8796767 if youre staying in the top 25 it shouldnt affect you
8796768 some argue if you stay in the top 30 theres really no change
8796769 i remember when san francisco dropped out of the top 5 and went to 6 they lost a lot of movie business
8796770 but when youre down at our level were considered a tier c movie market so well still be in that tier
8796771 its tough to see a city that you love in population decline
8796772 its not that weve had hundreds of thousands of people leaving our loss was fairly insignificant its just that other markets are growing and it is harder to recruit new employees to a no 23 market than it is to a no 19 market
8796773 i think they just shoot him from two different angles wearing a
8796774 they came to me and said are you interested in doing this and thats how it happened
8796775 hes a lifelong steelers fan and is extremely knowledgeable about the team and the game itself
8796776 there have been several occasions when weather mostly summer thunderstorms was an issue and we used jeffs expertise in these situations
8796777 i had a conversation with coach tomlin when he got here and he said youre my weatherman
8796778 sports and hd programming continue to be priorities for verizon but i cant be more specific about future content additions like the nhl network
8796779 no specific information about the future availability of the nhl network has been communicated to verizon sales representatives so there is no timetable that they should be sharing with customers
8796780 verizon is continually working to make more sports hd multicultural and other diverse programming available to fios tv customers but cannot preannounce anything until agreements with content providers are finalized
8796781 the site also includes a printable pdf file of the channel lineup that is periodically updated the one for pittsburgh was last updated 8 6 2008 and includes all the latest channels that were recently added this printable file has been available on that site for more than four weeks

8796783 i just want to ask you why of all the stations that you have at the time of the presidential coverage the convention coverage that fox news wasnt included are you afraid that more people will watch fox news you know there is such a thing as fairness even in politics and certainly the candidate for the republican party has been getting the shaft obama is a weirdo thank you
8796784 the selection did not contain anything that can be run on a server
8796785 focused on asheville but showcasing interesting arty happenings from all over the place
8796786 the idaho delegation sitting right next to the jones street boys
8796787 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8796788 and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons
8796789 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8796790 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8796791 i didnt know what i wanted for the country before now but now i realize that barack obama is the only person who can bring pride back to america
8796792 and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8796793 at this stage we are continuing to monitor the situation and maintaining a watching vigil
8796794 i will be in touch with the meaa today to see what the latest development is
8796795 a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8796796 you never know which part of the internet youll need which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8796797 the core web rendering engine in ie8 is compliant with web standards but we have also tried to maintain compatibility with sites written specifically for older versions of ie
8796798 sites that are specifically written for ie will not display properly many people probably will not ever use the compatibility button that microsoft has built into ie8 which means some sites will not work and the user will get a message saying the site needs internet explorer

8796877 up until this point the large tech companies like the ibms of the world have done pretty well in holding up their earnings because theyve had strong and consistent international demand

8796879 it is conservatism that has been relatively consistent for the last six months or so but it is somewhat spreading
8796880 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
8796881 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin
8796882 what people on the street wanted to see was revenue growth and a solid gross margin number because if you sell things for no profit to some extent whats the point this indicates that they might have to streamline even more now

8797006 i think that the numbers for vernon in terms of receptions may or may not be there this year
8797007 when we get him the ball wed like to get him the ball down the field or get him the ball in the shallow routes and let him take off with it
8797008 hes a coach that wants perfection willis said of his mentor
8797009 i have a lot of respect for paris hilton shes ballsy shes learned to play with the paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena i have fun with her but its always been platonic our relationship wasnt sexual though i understand that sex sells
8797010 she and i have a very open communication were friends with common interests if you want to know the whole story youve got to be my friend its easy to put those labels on people but theyre not accurate were young in hollywood having fun
8797011 being all morons shouting on there so who cares anyway
8797012 eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less
8797013 now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work
8797014 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8797015 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming because ive seen it because ive lived it
8797016 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8797017 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8797018 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8797019 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8797020 i just told him today youre the love of my life i dont really ever say that to anybody
8797021 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me
8797022 in other words are we going to rise to the occasion and be able to do it yes you always have contingency plans vis vis planes vis vis buses vis vis whos going to man the various desks in the campaign but i would say were in quite a good position to run a good campaign
8797023 a possible violation of the terms of setup a federal judge relied on when approving denvers security plans for the democratic national convention
8797024 authorities refused to allow water bottles into the plaza area for security reasons and event coordinators did not set up misting stations or water fountains or offer free water until shortly before obama appeared on stage at 2 p m volunteers tried to pass cups of water through the crowd but most people still missed out
8797025 worked closely with the city to ensure water was available at many locations both inside and outside the event site
8797026 when fascism comes to america it will be draped in the flag and be carrying the cross
8797027 thats not the kind of america that i want to live in
8797028 apart from that my friend kouchner also said that we will soon attack moldova and ukraine and the crimea but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well
8797029 john kerry lives in another world he visits our world
8797030 no one has ever said i saw john kerry standing in line waiting for a large coffee at dunkin donuts
8797031 no one has ever said to me hey i saw john kerry up at route 140 pumpin gas
8797032 not for as long as i live it will certainly take some time
8797033 the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us
8797034 perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off
8797035 i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8797036 let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess for he who promised is faithful
8797037 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8797038 the truth is that the choice is not between a dead mechanism and a rigid automatism on the one hand and conscious planning on the other hand the alternative is not plan or no plan the question is whose planning should each member of society plan for himself or should the paternal government alone plan for all the issue is not automatism versus conscious action it is spontaneous action of each individual versus the exclusive action of the government it is freedom versus government omnipotence
8797039 a good politician is quite as unthinkable as an honest burglar
8797040 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
8797041 equality presupposes the continuous intervention of force which as a principle is opposed to freedom

8797076 sundays new york times magazine contained an excellent article by david leonhardt on obamas economic philosophy and policy strategy its a very long article 14 pages when you print it out and thats because it really does take that long to try to explain obamas thoughts on economic policy obamas approach is not stark rhetorical and uncomplicated its nuanced compromising and thoughtful
8797077 on every economic issue senator biden has voted for more taxes more spending and bigger government
8797078 biden is an avid supporter of pork barrel spending supporting the bridge to nowhere in 2005 and winning the ignominious porker of the month award from citizens against government waste in january 2002 biden has been reliably anti trade and pro government regulation
8797079 sen joe bidens d de foreign policy experience may have led to his selection as barack obamas running mate but his fiscal record is less than stellar

8797087 im excited to be heading to australia theres a lot of buzz about the new championship and the new formats it is introducing to the sport
8797088 it will be great to race alongside chad the spotlight is on him after his recent win and this can only be good for other australian riders as their talent is placed on a world stage
8797089 i am so excited that jeremy mcgrath is going to come down to australia and race in two rounds of super x
8797090 he is a true legend of the sport and was my hero when i was coming through the ranks this is an opportunity of a lifetime for australian sporting fans to see jeremy myself and defending australian champion dan reardon all going head to head
8797091 from the outset weve promised the world a groundbreaking new supercross series and the confirmation of jeremy mcgrath is a major coup
8797092 jeremy transformed the sport and much of the following it enjoys today is due to his dominance and the incredible breed of sportsmanship he brought to supercross
8797093 i hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs in my brain because later you might think youre having a good idea but its just eggs hatching
8797094 children need encouragement so if a kid gets an answer right tell him it was a lucky guess that way he develops a good lucky feeling
8797095 is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful beautiful flamingo flying across in front of a beautiful sunset and hes carrying a beautiful rose in his beak and also hes carrying a very beautiful painting with his feet and also youre drunk
8797096 dad always thought laughter was the best medicine which i guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis
8797097 to me clowns arent funny in fact theyre kinda scary ive wondered where this started and i think it goes back to the time i went to the circus and a clown killed my dad
8797098 the wise man can pick up a grain of sand and envision a whole universe
8797099 to me boxing is like a ballet except theres no music no choreography and the dancers hit each other
8797100 i think a good novel would be where a bunch of men on a ship are looking for a whale they look and look but you know what they never find him and you know why they never find him it doesnt say the book leaves it up to you the reader to decide then at the very end theres a page you can lick and it tastes like kool aid
8797101 if you ever crawl inside an old hollow log and go to sleep and while youre in there some guys come and seal up both ends and then put it on a truck and take it to another city boy i dont know what to tell you
8797102 we probably want a few more games before that but thats the way it is
8797103 weve got one game before so well have to go back to our states and work pretty hard and try to do the best we can there to prepare as well as we can for india
8797104 its always hard to prepare for india which has such different conditions than here so it is going to be tough i think we will manage
8797105 playing one day cricket there i know how hard it is

8797109 were going out there to try to win it 3 0
8797110 i think it still could be better especially i was 4 1 up in the first set and then i let it go to 4 all said the russian who has reached the finals in six of her last seven tournaments including the games and the french open
8797111 i was lucky that i hold my serve there is much more room for me to play better
8797112 i feel overdue but youve got to win it to deserve it im always expecting more from myself i would love to win even more than what i do

8797126 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8797127 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8797128 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8797129 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8797135 excessive green taxes hit poorer people hardest hurt the competitiveness of british firms cause britain to export emissions and fall disproportionately on residents of rural and suburban areas
8797136 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed families and businesses
8797137 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab
8797138 the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut

8797205 she knows when my stuff is ripening she knows her stuff about food and promoting local food
8797206 i think there is a real connection between a healthy community and keeping our money in the local economy by supporting local farmers
8797207 creating that long term relationship with the farmers is key
8797208 its very easy to work with the farmers here you just make the connection have a conversation about your needs and then put it into motion
8797209 i got the desire to get my hands back in the soil and get more in touch with the source of my food
8797210 people really appreciate the fresh alternatives they can get here
8797211 they feel like theyre getting healthy food and they feel good when they eat it they get pretty excited when they realize how fresh the food is that it was picked as recently as this morning
8797212 you have to be persistent and be willing to prove your stuff is better that what they are going to get from the distributor
8797213 you cant just show up one day and say i have a bunch of cauliflower restaurants plan their menus two weeks out
8797214 i throw the words local growers in as much as possible when communicating with the public
8797215 dine fresh dine local is a great opportunity for restaurateurs like stephanie to highlight the quality food they source from local growers
8797216 it also highlights how diners communities and the landscape can benefit when eateries partner with local growers

8797220 i havent heard anything about any organized targeting but with individual officers preventive detention is not out of the realm of possibility
8797221 generally in the past police officers target convergence space spaces where activists tend to gather before big events
8797222 the police dont really do anything but ask a lot of questions and say things like we are watching you and we know you are with this group or that group or you know this person and this person is on our list
8797223 we have also seen visiting by police officers of individuals at their homes and businesses in an attempt to intimidate

8797393 it started for me when i was a family doctor in chanhassen i got patients to talk about what had been going in their lives and it directly contributed to why they were in my office
8797394 but they generally say that theyve dealt with it thats often times not the case
8797395 we can get to the root of most problems in about 20 minutes sometimes its longer but it doesnt matter to me my charge isnt going to be any more if i take 10 minutes or an hour
8797396 isnt well schooled and prepared to be president of the united states
8797397 there are not enough persons of color who want to be police officers
8797398 we get a huge benefit in having five or six officers at football and basketball games meeting with families
8797399 after school and weekend programming that would keep these kids off the street
8797400 if you take the juvenile crime problem away in three to four years we dont have a problem
8797401 has a lot of emerging cultures and we need to know how to deal with them
8797402 we have to compete with the honeywells and 3ms for four year degree people
8797403 there is a failure of local law enforcement to sit down and talk to the community in a positive way
8797404 i want you to do the job in my neighborhood as you do in minnetonka edina and bloomington
8797405 all we want from the police officers is to be fair
8797406 we go through three or four steps of different grievance processes while they continue to work
8797407 my discipline is on hold until the officers go through their grievance process
8797408 it slows everything way down in order for due process to take place
8797409 people were giving some real concrete concerns and they were sharing that with the police chiefs i also think that the police chiefs were giving their honest opinions in regard to what their goals were
8797410 i think cultural training is very important and i think that could possibly break down some of the barriers in terms of communication
8797411 we promise you that we will continue to pursue these issues
8797412 people responded and interacted i think we are off to a very good beginning of this process
8797413 i felt pretty good that i got my information and some ideas out and i got some information that can help me when i go back to the department tomorrow
8797414 i wished we could have been more focused on policy
8797415 but when people have the opportunity to speak to police chiefs they want to be able to say what they want to say
8797416 it is going to be important for the council the communities of color and other agencies and organizations to put forth a criminal justice agenda that is going to make a difference in 2009
8797417 i think this was a great first forum i was very impressed with the people who showed up i hope we double and triple our attendance at the next one scheduled for october

8797420 dan holt and ian macgregor have also shown excellent form lately so they have to be protected up to one point too
8797421 but to win we have to race aggressively we cant wait until the end
8797422 some guys will be in early break someone will be helping our key guys keeping them in the right place and bringing them to the front before the big climb
8797423 obviously this is a new great experience for joe and phil to be part of the pro team at nationals
8797424 joe needs to be active in the early part of the race and if any break goes he will need to be there for phil this is his first race with team after his surgery so he will be helping the guys from beginning till end
8797425 the important thing is to see where he stands now
8797426 this will be very helpful for his preparation for the 2009 season

8797432 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8797433 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8797434 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it

8797492 my focus is to show off things that i learn that are really relevant to teachers

8797677 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because he doesnt get it
8797678 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work

8797686 the change we need doesnt come from washington it comes to washington
8797687 we cannot turn back with so much work to be done
8797688 and it is that promise that forty five years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8797689 what did my little child do to deserve this torture
8797690 suddenly i felt somebody stumble against my bed i saw a person wearing jeans and tshirt run away i ran after him but left the chase thinking he could not be a thief as there is hardly anything worth stealing in my house when i came back i saw my daughter whimpering and covered in mud and blood

8797700 comprehensive revision of schedule y that prescribes requirements of clinical trials has been undertaken in order to harness the countrys potential to participate in global multi centric clinical trials
8797701 the aiims is a renowned research institution the children must have died because they were already very ill
8797702 we can have a broad discussion on the subject in the country but at the same time i would say that india has become the hub of a lot of research activities which is the need of the hour
8797703 a huge population with a diversity of diseases that are untreated yes that is the india advantage identified by igate clinical research international commenting that india represents a largely untapped resource for clinical trials
8797704 40 million asthmatic patients about 34 million diabetic patients eight to ten million people hiv positive eight million epileptic patients three million cancer patients
8797705 medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations in which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research
8797706 i dont poverty anybody thats been in my chronicle before in my chronicle anymore
8797707 i dont modify poverty them to hit some artefact of contacting me
8797708 i meet love so i dont see when grouping cant do just what i do
8797709 i utilised to indite really dark songs every period in my shack like fivesome or sextet a period and id be up until 5 in the morning
8797710 mom would become up and say so what are you writing id endeavor her a song and shed go wow go to therapy but it rattling is therapy for me
8797711 she has been my image ontogeny up that would be the large imagine become true
8797712 im quite happy with america the way it is today
8797713 usc michigan are big games but i am most looking forward to illinois theres some revenge needed when we head there
8797714 cada a o se toman medidas de seguridad que no se repiten lo que hace al carn universitario sea m s dif cil de falsificar
8797715 everybodys known for weeks that nkunda was preparing to attack
8797716 nkunda is playing a dangerous game hes playing with fire and hes going to get burned
8797717 government forces attacked all of our positions in rutshuru for months the government has been carrying out maneuvers to prepare this attack
8797718 i was holding the beer spigot over her mouth but it was not a functional beer keg
8797719 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8797720 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8797721 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8797722 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8797723 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8797724 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8797725 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8797726 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8797727 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8797728 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8797729 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8797730 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8797731 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8797732 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8797733 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8797734 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8797735 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8797736 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8797737 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8797738 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8797739 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8797740 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8797741 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8797742 estoy cansado de explicar esto una y otra vez asi que pongo esto para que mis amigos y demas personas de una vez lo lean

8797747 when man landed on the moon in 1969 they expected the landing module to sink in a deep layer of dust but the layer was only a few inches deep this proves that the universe is still young
8797748 of course the dinoceros existed as fenech pronounces the word it is mentioned in the book of job they were used to help build the pyramids
8797749 you could have just shut up sat back and left us alone but noooooooo you had to stick your nose and your money into an issue that never had any effect on you your family or your hotels now youre involved dougie and you and your employees and your vendors and everybody else who depends on you to make a living have no one to blame but yourself

8797754 indeed i think there has been enough eating and drinking in this book already quite enough of everything in fact but the time has nearly come to say goodbye
8797755 a can ask b to help him build his house for nothing now and in return promises to help b build his house in the future
8797756 the error here is that credit does not fund economic growth only actual savings
8797757 this is irrelevant spending savings on sustenance is neither necessary nor sufficient to produce the house building houses with labor either paid for or borrowed produces houses besides nothing says you cant build a house and gather food
8797758 is it too much to ask for an accurate and precise theme statement
8797759 so where does the home builder get the materials to build the house it doesnt matter
8797760 didn t he have to give up some consumption save in order to purchase them
8797761 how is it impossible to build a house part time as opposed to full time and how would that invalidate my analogy
8797762 a gained their revenue voluntarily rather than by coercion and
8797763 of course some of the private defense agencies will become criminal just as some people become criminal now but the point is that in a stateless society there would be no regular legalized channel for crime and aggression no government apparatus the control of which provides a secure monopoly for invasion of person and property
8797764 he could gather make them himself or someone else could do it for a promise of repayment
8797765 so where does the home builder get the materials to build the house it doesnt matter
8797766 this is irrelevant spending savings on sustenance is neither necessary nor sufficient to p

8797807 thats what inspired my interest it became really important to me
8797808 im thrilled and i applaud the city for sticking with it
8797809 i had not worked with government per se and i didnt have any expectation that it would take this long
8797810 it took a while for the city to figure out how to make it work financially
8797811 this is a late summer heat wave said steve anderson a forecaster for the national weather service in monterey
8797812 it will still be hot on friday in some places with near record temperatures so people should still take precautions anderson said

8797816 what is the total amount of overcharges im not certain the audit came up with an answer
8797817 even if the contract carried out the letter of the law
8797818 it is obvious it did not carry out the spirit

8797823 this is pretty grim analysis coming from the world bank
8797824 the urgency to act has never been greater especially in sub saharan africa where half the population of the continent lives in extreme poverty a figure that hasnt changed for over 25 years
8797825 poverty has fallen by about 1 per year since 1981
8797826 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts
8797827 what is the total amount of overcharges im not certain the audit came up with an answer
8797828 even if the contract carried out the letter of the law
8797829 it is obvious it did not carry out the spirit
8797830 the first episode needs to serve as a pilot as if youve never seen it
8797831 he was in maximum security most of that time fighting for his life the rest in solitary confinement
8797832 you have a character who is wild and imaginative and poetic and cracked and warped as you like the world has changed
8797833 we wont wait until the end of the season to hit those milestones
8797834 crews was constantly battling the forces of revenge and transcendence were resetting that to where its a brightly lit world money cars girls that want him
8797835 we talked about our favorite shows house dexter sopranos they were all character based thats what we wanted for life we hope we offer more than just a cop show the genres a little tired
8797836 its so hard to find original beats and colors in the cop genre
8797837 open source an open question for red hat and others
8797838 i want to get involved in writing emails to members of congress urging them to cut off funding for the war and other things but if i do that wont i end up getting put on a watch list or something
8797839 its just obvious that you cant have free immigration and a welfare state
8797840 agree or disagree you have to give krikorian credit for starting the debate
8797841 i am very proud of barack obama i believe in him and i believe he will do good things for this county i hope the country gives him that opportunity
8797842 i didnt know that was the date of kings speech
8797843 i am so focused on trying to win my match and obviously coming down from the olympics in beijing its been a whirlwind so ive been just pretty much focused on tennis
8797844 we are good enough friends so that we will probably go out to dinner after if we can
8797845 whoever loses might have to pick up the check or something but we are good enough friends that no matter who wins we will still be friends after the match
8797846 i felt really good out there i was moving well
8797847 yeah i guess that is a good statement kind of overdue got to win it to deserve it
8797848 youve got five or six guys you could easily put out there with the women losing sharapova ivanovic and henin limits the automatics
8797849 i dont follow politics as much as maybe the rest of you guys do
8797850 i am glad we were able to make this fight happen because while pacquiao is at the pinnacle of his success and has defeated all of the top fighters he has faced i am going to show the world that it stops with me
8797851 i know he is bigger than me and taller than me but i believe im stronger
8797852 when you look at the dubai world cup theres 12 13 head anytime they put up a lot of money and its a grade i we never had one given to us you got to earn it and with everything at stake they make you earn it
8797853 to run in this race with its history is one of our goals
8797854 one thing about him is that we dont have to make any excuses for wanderin boy
8797855 he doesnt have to apologize to anybody what race he goes in being second to invasor in the pimlico special when nobody knew who invasor was being second to bernardini being second to lawyer ron you got a horse of the year and two champions he ran second to thats why hes a grade i horse
8797856 well have fun i like doing what were doing i hope i see it turn out okay its happened that way a few times
8797857 curlin is definitely a great horse and it is not an easy task for us but we have everything to gain and nothing to lose
8797858 they just didnt have the resources to put on the training
8797859 were expecting to be up and operating by the end of the month
8797860 its been a long haul with many obstacles ahead of us public transportation is a very complex issue the licensing regulations the insurance issues its a lot of ts to be crossed and is to be dotted
8797861 even where we have our bus stops we have to have those always reviewed by the utility and review board
8797862 usually on a bus you have 50 or 60 seats and on ours we only have 26 we wanted to give a lot of space and nice big seats because we dont know if were going to maybe be renting the bus out on a saturday to someone doing excursions we could be driving for two hours so we want sure our clientele are very comfortable
8797863 the international program was emerging as the most vibrant and interesting part of the conference and one that was strictly business
8797864 these are people who purchase live music and thats what they were here to do and they did to the tune of 1 1 million in 2006 2007 so they bought over 1 million worth of east coast music
8797865 this product east coast music has a better chance of being successful in foreign markets than it does in the canadian market
8797866 you cant argue with the numbers i mean theres 60 million people in england and the country is the size of new brunswick you can do a lot more business in a short period of time over there than you can touring the maritimes
8797867 theres two ways to look at it one is the canadian identity and not having our artists out there and the other is just strictly business so either way it doesnt make sense to cut these programs
8797868 for several years running now i have enthusiastically taken part in the ecma conferences international program each year several of my meetings have lead to tangible opportunities for my clients in a variety of areas
8797869 it is the most important and productive aspect of the entire ecma weekend it is where some serious business gets done
8797870 its going to affect the travel patterns of our cape breton artists more than it directly affects celtic colours and i think we need to be very concerned about that because we have great stuff thats very exportable from here and in fact in order to make a living a lot of our fiddlers and dancers and gaelic singers and people like that do travel overseas
8797871 it was pretty overwhelming in the sense that there are places down there that still dont have power so theyre not able to move back into their homes
8797872 when the storm came through it knocked down a lot of power substations and around a lot of apartment complexes there are a lot of transformers and those transformers contain pcbs polychlorinated biphenyls
8797873 most of the private companies are able to pay to have consultants do the cleanup and depending on the extent they may or may not be able to get it done in a couple of months
8797874 but we had a couple of projects that when we got into them they thought they were looking at a couple of acres that were affected and it turned out to be a much larger area were still in the process of trying to assess and clean up those sites
8797875 its almost like playing battleship you start drilling some holes where you think theres some potential problems and you have to expand out from that point
8797876 the problem down here is a lot of insurance companies even before katrina started putting mould exclusions in the policies because they were losing a lot of money trying to cover those things
8797877 well just have to wait and see what happens it can change of course but forecasters think its going to be smaller than katrina

8797892 this gentleman was well liked as an educator who was looked up as a mentor by his students
8797893 we know just from what neighbors have said that he was last seen on his porch about 15 to 20 minutes before the 911 call came in that he had been shot we dont know if he was actually confronted by the suspect on the front porch and forced back into his house or if he had actually gone back into his house and perhaps the door was left unlocked or if he just left it open intending to return to the porch and was confronted by the suspect inside his residence
8797894 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8797895 so as you can see i am in a real hardship situation now i spend very very long 24 hours days in my cell cut off from everything i know i cannot work a job or go to church or use the library or recreational facilities in prison
8797896 because if they do it poisons the witness it has to be turned over to the defense and the defense will of course raise that when the person is testifying
8797897 it would be an opportunity for the state to write letters to the parole board to recommend his release if he has any pending charges that are still in front of the davidson county or any other district attorneys office in the state
8797898 it seems as though i also am being punished severely along with mendenhall and i did what was right in order to save these detectives lives
8797899 for those who like to tailgate a little longer they might get upset about it i could see
8797900 you feel bad when you have a family or little kid sitting behind you so you dont want to disturb the game for them
8797901 more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured
8797902 will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8797903 he sat right here and said i would never hurt old people
8797904 i just figured hed be back to finish and he just refuses to come back
8797905 we got information through social services that his 17 year old son had reported his father was asking him to purchase controlled substances for him
8797906 he did indeed have a drug problem hence his need to purchase the drugs through his son
8797907 would i use this app does it do something that another app doesnt is it maybe just some reverse engineered ripoff can i live without it will it change the way i do business
8797908 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8797909 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8797910 he looked at me and i guess he noticed the injuries or all the blood everywhere and he panicked
8797911 we could see evacuees from louisiana or from the texas gulf coast depending on where the storm hits
8797912 the best summary i can give to people is we have to pray for the best but prepare for the worst
8797913 years ago when we protested a war people would weigh in against us saying my country right or wrong our answer absolutely my country right or wrong when right keep it right when wrong make it right sometimes loving your country demands you must tell the truth to power
8797914 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8797915 barcamp is free to all of those who would like to attend and is a fantastic way to hear about all of the exciting things happening in nashvilles digital world as well as meet some of your peers from not only nashville but from all around the country the event will be a full day of speakers discussions and networking in a casual setting that aims to educate as well as foster community
8797916 hed throw the ball and id have to say the color like black or red before you caught it
8797917 and hed throw pretty hard too youd have to look at them and catch one handed
8797918 initially i was but now its almost expected im at the point that if he doesnt make those great catches then something is wrong
8797919 i think were a lot deeper and much better skill wise
8797920 we compare to any group in the nation as well as the pac 10 we have young guys who can make plays and theyre big and fast
8797921 everett johnson austin embree and right now rosario moutra is on the cusp
8797922 i told him the other day i havent heard your name being called lately
8797923 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8797924 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8797925 it is why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8797926 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8797927 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8797928 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8797929 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8797930 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8797931 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8797932 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8797933 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8797934 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8797935 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8797936 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8797937 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8797938 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8797939 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8797940 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8797941 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8797942 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8797943 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8797944 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies retool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8797945 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8797946 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8797947 the one thing everyone will remember from this convention is the historic speech made under colorado skies
8797948 obama standing before tens of thousands of people joined under a rocky mountain sky where possibilities seem as endless and luminous as the many broncos skyboxes shining from above
8797949 thank you for ordering your drinks will be up in a few minutes
8797950 didnt you say a while ago that you wanted to do a solo of indigo blue love
8797951 you fell asleep lets go get changed then you can sleep until the cows come home
8797952 we have established that all types of antipsychotics carry an increased risk although the risk might be somewhat higher with the atypical drugs
8797953 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed
8797954 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life
8797955 he could also have been killed by one of the spikes
8797956 i dont remember nor do i remember what kind of person she was
8797957 think of it as an example a persons death counter is final
8797958 you could fly the speed of a jet how can you not be able to save her
8797959 you lead me on you lead me on into thinking we could have
8797960 they seem to act normal im too scared to ask if they got over it
8797961 ever since funeral two weeks ago i was worried that miki nee might be broken again
8797962 ah yes this kamei san was special to her huh
8797963 she was but you know i was glad that nee san was a little stronger this time not like when matsuura san
8797964 so am i strong for having stopped mourning like nee san and ishikawa san right now or am i just running away by doing so

8797973 whos acting like the jerk i just told you to lay off the hard work and let me handle it that was me trying to be nice

8798023 the evolution of distance education implications for instructional design on the potential of the web
8798024 the faculty the distance education de organizations the learners and their employers and the id field all have a common interest in performance based definitions of quality
8798025 id faculty should lead the effort to shape institutional policies on distance education quality standards and accreditation and should actively engage in consultation and development
8798026 well we got a win and thats the number one objective whenever you play a game but we have to do some things better on the field than what we did this evening
8798027 i thought our defense hung in there and played well they were put in some maybe tough spots during the game but i thought they did a good job only giving up three points i wasnt happy with the nine minute drive that we had against us but i thought they did a good job
8798028 i thought for the most part our special teams did a good job creating field position
8798029 offensively we were just very very inconsistent we cant play like that we cant throw three interceptions we cant get down in the red zone and not come away with points in those situations thats something were going to have to work on and get better at i thought donald brown played very well i thought anthony sherman did some good things but we just didnt have the consistency that i want on offense
8798030 i think weve had some inconsistencies more so in our passing game than the running game again its one of those situations where we have to continue to work on it we have to make quicker reads we cant stare things down we have to throw the ball on time if we do those things were fine i thought cody endres went in and did a pretty good job he was making quick decisions quick reads thats the one thing weve talked to tyler lorenzen about weve told tyler these are the things we need to improve on and i know hes working very very hard to do that
8798031 it was the score i wanted to get some guys in develop them and get them some work because again its a long season this is the first of 11 so hopefully if these guys have to get in there and play than they have some experience under their belt
8798032 i was just being impatient but thats unacceptable i cant let that happen
8798033 no that wasnt it i was just over thinking i will have to watch the tape and figure out what i did wrong the bottom line is any amount of interceptions is unacceptable whether it is three or one it is my job to take care of the football and that needs to be my main focus during the game
8798034 its funny because coach ambrose walked in after the game and said that we did win the ultimate goal is to win but there is an expectation on the offensive side of the ball in regards to the way we want to play we take pride in taking care of the football and i was guilty of not doing that tonight so i am going to learn what i did wrong and try to fix it
8798035 the defensive line did a helluva job everyone was going after the ball but we can do a better job than that there were a couple of times the quarterback got away from us so we have to do a better job of containing him
8798036 we were preparing for savage but i guess there some reason why he didnt play we just had to go with what we studied and in the end it worked out well for us
8798037 it seemed like they had the ball for a whole quarter it is frustrating one thing we take pride in on defense is third down percentage and they completed some on that drive and that is one thing that we cant have we got to learn to fix that and try to get more pressure on the quarterback
8798038 not our best it was definitely not our best there were too many little things we did wrong and i think that we will have them corrected by next game we have to enjoy the win we come out each and every week to get a win and we were lucky enough to come away with one
8798039 he has worked his tail off in this offseason and he deserves all the success he had tonight he was ready for the game and i am happy for him
8798040 i dont see the difference he is just a hard worker the line did great opening some holes for him and he took advantage of them with his speed and strength he really capitalized on it
8798041 not really i did not lose much weight there might be a pound or two difference but i dont think i lost thirty pounds or something i just worked hard this offseason tried to make my weaknesses my strengths and my strengths even stronger tonight the offensive line did a great job opening holes you could drive a truck through them the wide receivers did a great job blocking down field and the fullbacks did a great job blocking too which made my job easier
8798042 i feel good i feel confident and i am healthy which is all i can ask for right now the offensive line did a great job blocking and so did the wide receivers and full backs so thats all she wrote
8798043 i think we did alright i think we can do better everybody can always improve but as a group i think that we ok
8798044 it was good to get a win but as a team we see what we have to work on we have practice saturday and we look forward getting back to work
8798045 obviously we were beaten in every facet of the game coaching special teams to offense and defense hats off to their staff and their players they did a great job at the same time were not going to beat teams in the caa or other teams in our schedule if were going to have missed opportunities and the mistakes we made this evening i think our effort was great my hats off to our players i thought they played hard to the last whistle but we got to play smarter we got to prepare the players better from a coaching perspective there are things to work on but tonight was definitely uconns night
8798046 16 minutes before kickoff no ive never had that happen to me before something was bothering him it was brought to the attention from the trainer to the doctor and it was in his best interest not to play no it didnt change our offense cory can throw the ball he has rifle the difference is that bryan took 75 of the reps that would be the only difference we did highlight some different quarterback runs that we might not have and i think you saw corys ability athletically and physically to make some plays he showed a lot of courage and a lot of leadership
8798047 i think the two things were that the effort was great weve got some tough kids in there that never stop and i think we have ability there were times offensively we looked good catching and throwing and defensively there were at least three different drives that were stopped but due to special teams uconn got a whole new life its a credit to the players that they played the full four quarters
8798048 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
8798049 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
8798050 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
8798051 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
8798052 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video
8798053 im still an amateur but i want to thank jype for giving me the chance to debut as a music video director and making my dreams come true

8798058 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8798059 its happened to us before and weve lost not just to bangladesh but to a lot of teams
8798060 as soon as you take things for granted i think you find yourself asking questions why youve lost that game so its important we concentrate on saturday
8798061 all i can do is be me whoever that is

8798088 a grant paid by a government to an enterprise that benefits the public
8798089 a subsidy is a grant or monetary gift given by a private person or entity often a government to another private person or entity as financial assistance or to help launch an enterprise supporters of subsidies often justify their use as intended for some socially beneficial purpose although economists point out that subsidies may often have socially detrimental effects examples of subsidies include welfare farm subsidies and certain aspects of student loans a subsidy normally exemplifies the opposite of a tax but can also be given using a reduction of the tax burden this kind of subsidy are generally called tax expenditures

8798106 i dont know how far ahead they planned that we obviously revealed our drum kit much earlier than they did
8798107 ive a feeling there was a oh theres cymbals how can we put cymbals on our kit that would be the easiest way without having to rewire everything and re engineer the entire circuit board
8798108 my understanding on that drum kit is the cymbals are dual mapped so its just another way to trigger the exact same thing you can trigger on the kit
8798109 we have a lot of expandability you can plug in any drum kit and play it if you want to use a keyboard and play the right notes for drums you can do that you can use one of those hand sonic drums you can use any input device that transmits on midi channel 10 in our game to trigger the drums it could be a power glove
8798110 you can easily run a double bass pedal on our game
8798111 we have future expandability for high hat control pedals it would also be very easy for us to add other cymbals via the midi interface with the midi jack we can expand it to as many drums and cymbals as humanly possible theres just only so many that the casual consumer can take
8798112 our high hat control would not just be another way to trigger the high hat it would be a completely separate interface thats mapped differently and that correlates differently in game
8798113 it might just look like more songs but really the technology that were pushing forward and some of the features weve added its not just a title update it really is a new game with a lot of really great stuff
8798114 we actually have expansion ports on the back of our drum kits that let you attach three cymbals to your drum set
8798115 at harmonix we really are musicians first and game people second my drum set has three cymbals on it i dont know how many drum sets youve seen with two cymbals on them i guess thats a question for other people
8798116 the world is in a constant conspiracy against the brave its the age old struggle the roar of the crowd on the one side and the voice of your conscience on the other
8798117 sen mccain has always been sensitive to national crisis in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement to run for the presidency because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely
8798118 there is no change to the presidents schedule at this point

8798123 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet
8798124 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush

8798128 however when the family of dr siddiqui saw the photograph of the young boy they immediately recognized him and said that he was aafias son
8798129 the pakistan government was alerted that something had happened that aafias photograph was no longer there
8798130 in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that possession is for a purpose connected with the commission preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism
8798131 with their government they do what they want to do when they want to do it here he has rights over there there are no rights
8798132 defer nonessential travel to yemen the security threat level remains high due to terrorist activities
8798133 im glad he had money because he had to buy his own food if he didnt have any money they would give him vitamins
8798134 i cant write to him i cant talk to him
8798135 his son nasir jr started eighth grade and hes worrying about his dad being in prison in another country for no reason at all
8798136 why did they give him a visa if this happens all the time
8798137 whyd they pick him up the whole thing is just not right and the embassy is giving me the runaround
8798138 people dont understand the seriousness of traveling overseas right now
8798139 yemen is on the hot list of the u s it doesnt make any sense going over there
8798140 a lot of people want to study and practice islam and live in a country where they can speak arabic
8798141 go someplace that has a good relationship with the u s
8798142 by the realization that guant namo was a strategic failure
8798143 all of us in the discussion agreed that guant namo was not working for lots of reasons and that the simplest way to proceed is that when you have foreign fighters captured you send them back home
8798144 if you dont send them to gitmo and the c i a doesnt want them then where do you put them
8798145 monitored by d o d personnel and their conduct must be consistent with d o d policy
8798146 the u s has aggressively looked for opportunities to repatriate detainees
8798147 in countries where we know they have a program to rehabilitate detainees like saudi arabia weve had good success
8798148 what you have is a situation in which the u s wants to get all the saudi prisoners to saudi arabia because the saudis know how to deal with them
8798149 when it comes to sending people back home there is really no way for us to find out how they are doing
8798150 its the kind of action that if it leaks can cause political reverberations in the street there were qualities of imperial hubris that i thought were wrong
8798151 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8798152 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8798153 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8798154 senator mccain likes to talk about judgement but really what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time
8798155 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8798156 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of senator obama
8798157 the fact remains obama is still not ready to be president
8798158 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8798159 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8798160 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8798161 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change america needs
8798162 well i say to them tonight theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america
8798163 the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats
8798164 but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states we coach little league school baseball in the blue states and yes weve got some gay friends in the red states
8798165 do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope
8798166 the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs
8798167 the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too
8798168 a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters
8798169 the programme explored how the war of ideas within the jihadi movement is becoming as important as the military front line
8798170 was it the result of a push from ricu absolutely not frank and innes did have contact with ricu and saw three members of the unit after they had finished recording interviews ricu gave them briefing materials that were not used in the programme
8798171 the afghan government should immediately relinquish 11 year old ahmed siddiqui to the custody of his family
8798172 briefly held by afghanistans interior ministry and then transferred to the custody of the afghan national security directorate nds the countrys intelligence agency
8798173 his current whereabouts are unknown the nds is notorious for its brutal treatment of detainees
8798174 too young to be considered criminally responsible for his mothers alleged acts
8798175 us foreign policy is akin to government sponsored terrorism these days it was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on september 11 last year i am solo i will continue to disrupt at the highest levels
8798176 intentional and calculated to influence and affect the us government by intimidation and coercion
8798177 what i did was illegal and wrong and i accept i should be punished but i am not a member of al qaeda i believe my case is being treated so seriously because theyre scared of what ive seen im living in a surreal nutters film
8798178 the reason i left not just one note but multiple notes on multiple desk tops was to say look this is ridiculous
8798179 he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8798180 we have sought to further reduce police bureaucracy making sure that the public feel confident with police accountability while ensuring that the police have the power to carry out their key duties on the front line
8798181 having delayed introducing postcharge questioning in the area of terrorism it is now worth seeing how this works in practice before extending it more widely
8798182 the liberal democrats have long supported the introduction of postcharge questioning as an alternative to increasing the maximum detention period without charge
8798183 simply the death of a child brings sadness in normal circumstances
8798184 if you were to add to this that our son had received so much abuse harm systematic torture and then in the end wrongful killing then you would get a better picture of what we feel
8798185 before we heard of his death we were hopeful he might be released any day and we were just awaiting his return
8798186 i really cannot find the words to express how that has impacted us
8798187 it would be inappropriate to provide significant advance notice to detainees regarding pending departures in the event plans could change with receiving nations among other concerns
8798188 our main focus is really the fact that the men were in the exclusive custody of the united states and the responsibility there is by virtue of that
8798189 i think the families want recognition of what they have suffered of the fact that their sons were wrongfully detained for four years without charge they want an apology which they have never had and they want closure
8798190 the government caused these deaths by first wrongfully detaining them and secondly in a most cowardly fashion refusing to acknowledge their mistake and immediately moving them out
8798191 they now say they were engaged in warfare against the united states if they died as enemies of this country we know who made them that
8798192 it is a government that has shown so much arrogance and misuse and abuse of power injustice and it has treaded over the rights of people and the feelings of people
8798193 during the past few years because of these practices it has generated so much hatred against it
8798194 we have the army disaster management teams police and other groups of rescuers making every effort to save the population
8798195 during our flood response last year we found that the levels of children trafficked from the state increased in large numbers two of the affected districts arraria and katiyar according to our study have the highest instance of child trafficking the current disaster will increase levels of poverty and desperation and create a favourable environment for traffickers
8798196 the monsoon comes every year why werent they ready for the disaster the fact is that there was much less flow in the river than the stated capacity which exposes the kind of maintenance that was done
8798197 unfortunate lobby consisting of politicians bureaucrats builders and engineers who take money and dont do any work there is no oversight of this process thats why we get flooding every year
8798198 yeah there are no vampires in the treatment there may be a mermaid but im not sure i dont want to give away too much because were letting meyer run with her vision i mean i will say theres a good amount of water in the video and what else can i say
8798199 its cool its not some sort of expos on my life its nice to know were going to make a video for the sake of making a video were making something thats kind of fantastic and different and exciting but isnt about the song specifically and it isnt about me specifically
8798200 im quickly becoming super aware of how big of a deal it is im partway into twilight now i found out about stephenie through a close friend who told me i dont know if you know this but youre referenced in a couple of places on stephenies web site as being a musical inspiration for what she does and i was obviously incredibly flattered especially considering the finger she has on a lot of pop culture
8798201 so we were getting to this place where we were getting video treatments and we had seen a lot of good things but nothing that was really jumping out at us
8798202 so i said can i reach out to her and see if shed be interested in writing for the video and coming out and directing it and we got her music and she was fantastic and weve been working with her ever since
8798203 and it works so well because with my music i always try to create something super visual and create a backdrop where people can take a bunch of experiences but relate them and shes done that in a huge way with her books
8798204 malema does not have an original thought in his head
8798205 he harms the country and often has no mandate to say what he does
8798206 at our meeting julius told kgalema that he was irresponsible in his public comments the comments from his nec colleagues were harsher than anything julius has said we made it clear that we were not happy with his public postures
8798207 but you could see he thinks we dont understand issues we agreed to engage him again but not to criticise him publicly
8798208 everyone is shocked by his conduct or rather misconduct the anc accepts that zuma is undergoing a political trial its inconsistent to say that and say we should not criticise the judiciary
8798209 he is deviating from anc positions we know other alliance leaders are strongly against what he is doing they are saying he is going on a trajectory that will expose him to attack internally
8798210 he isnt the voice of reason he wants to be a hero of the liberal media
8798211 i said malemas statement was reckless and i said to the youth leaders that they cannot slavishly copy the 1976 generation
8798212 the new freedom means they must define for themselves new challenges because the conditions are different from 1976 when apartheid was still in force
8798213 the anc has always been known to mean what it says we each have to take responsibility for our statements
8798214 i havent heard kgalema deviate from the zuma position hes a principled man the only problem weve had with him was when he refused to go to cabinet we had to debate and persuade him
8798215 other people dont have the balls he has they patronise the youth league instead of being honest with them maybe some of the noise about kgalema relates to the ancs 2012 congress when he may contest the presidency
8798216 mbeki didnt like him because hes principled the anc is safe under his leadership the fact that he was elected to lead the deployment committee shows the trust people have in him deployment causes bitter conflict in the party
8798217 many anc people are afraid to stick their necks out in case they get chopped off
8798218 all i know is theres water where there didnt used to be
8798219 the precipitous decline in arctic ice continues to exacerbate friction between competing claims of sovereignty between canada and other nations vying for access to the warming arctic 2008 arctic summer sea ice nears another record the national snow and ice data center in boulder colorado reports the 2008 polar summer sea ice retreat is now at its second lowest level since data measurements began in the 1970s with several weeks still left in the melt season this year may still break the record set last year as of august 26 arctic sea ice extent was 2 03 million square miles a decline of 795 000 square miles since the beginning of the month many scientists studying the sea ice fluctuations fear that the arctic is at or very near a tipping point data center senior scientist mark serreze says we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8798220 one under was a good score today with the wind and the soft greens
8798221 i think that some greens drain better than these theres no question
8798222 so well have to look into that at a future date
8798223 this was ok one over is by no means out of this tournament
8798224 visitors flying into the twin cities for the republican national convention were up until last friday to be greeted upon arrival by the gigantic face of a u s soldier new york based artist
8798225 when i saw them on the news i couldnt really see them
8798226 i wanted to turn the idea of a soldier on its head and look at them as vulnerable
8798227 i wanted to look in the face of a young person who has seen something that has marked their lives
8798228 whether or not you can see that in the photograph is another matter
8798229 they said he was resisting arrest stan said no im not no im not he was just standing there the other officer yelled get the taser get the taser
8798230 they pulled him up and said stanley stand up youre all right
8798231 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
8798232 theres a reason why denver hasnt had a convention in 100 years
8798233 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8798234 a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8798235 i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle eastand strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaeda
8798236 a successful war against iraq would require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
8798237 ive had certain putts i had in real life competition break the same way and by the same amount
8798238 great military qualifications dont necessarily make for great presidential qualifications
8798239 a lack of a universally available mass storage device on one platform is offset by the simplicity of its unified memory architecture multiple cores on another may open up more programming possibilities but that is offset by the complexity of designing the code architecture
8798240 im especially impressed with our salesman ernie schmidt at peninsula infiniti in redwood city california he went out of his way to make sure the issue was resolved and that we were completely happy with our car and the extender i would personally recommend him to anyone large or small interested in buying an infiniti in the san francisco area i suppose the end result of this is extenders are avaialble from nissan for any model of infiniti but something is wrong with the part categories the order needs to be for a 200 model car in order to get the extender that fits a 1997 model
8798241 you dont have access to parts that saturn makes for their cars
8798242 its challenging in the sense that its something i havent done in the past i have tatoos all over my body
8798243 i love my character here so i asked my bosses if i can do this one
8798244 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8798245 theyd love it to be lindsay and theyre actually going to ask
8798246 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
8798247 it might be that all it takes is a few good men to do nothing for evil to flourish but it only takes one or two good men to take things too far for injustice to flourish
8798248 i am a fairly new volunteer as i joined about a year ago when i seen an ad in the local newspaper for volunteers wanting to take a shelter class i took that class and have been on the go ever since i am a co captain on our local dat team line up the candy for our blood mobile and help whenever and wherever i can i love the red cross

8798250 i felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldnt screw to save its species
8798251 god signed like with a pen the location where the ark of the covenant was located you can see it today even on the rock
8798252 what happened why did this most dramatic instrument of gods glory and power in human history suddenly vanish
8798253 the ark of the covenant was made of wood and it was gold plated such an amount of gold would be melted down at the time of war immediately after it was captured
8798254 and he knew that at the end of the gate he will come to the secret room where the ark of covenant is located
8798255 arab demonstrations you know the israelis are coming to build their temple underneath the dome of the rock
8798256 no doubt i tell you no doubt we needed just two days more to come to the place where the ark of the covenant is located
8798257 the work was done without archaeological supervision and when i was the official archaeologist of jerusalem i decided to stop the work
8798258 prophet jeremiah says there will come a day when the ark of the covenant will not be seen nor will it be visited which means that somehow he sees the days when it will not be there in other words this was a hint from god dont look for the ark of the covenant
8798259 perhaps when its time to build the third temple the second temple treasures will be found why because in ezra and nehemiah the bible indicated that when it was time to build the second temple god restored the treasures from the first temple which of course have been carted off to babylon
8798260 when its time to build a third temple the second temples treasures would be found wouldnt that be dramatic
8798261 it is soon to come i tell you i promise you and you check me test me it will be in our lifetime
8798262 i felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldnt screw to save its species
8798263 because of the role hls5 plays in keeping cell growth at a normal rate we expect that these compounds will greatly slow down the growth of cancer cells this discovery is very encouraging and a great step forward in our quest to create new cancer treatments
8798264 our preliminary data reveals that several of these compounds do indeed markedly slow down the growth of human cancer cells
8798265 importantly we also know through computer modelling that nearly all of these compounds have drug like qualities
8798266 from here we take the research to the next phase of laboratory testing with the ultimate hope of investigating if one of these molecules can be used to create a fresh treatment that can slow growth of cancer cells in patients
8798267 we need more space to display the artefacts the asi will soon vacate the premises and then we will go for a massive expansion of the museum
8798268 we want the museum to be comparable to any other museum internationally
8798269 we have now got one permission from the ministry and are waiting for another one after that we would start construction
8798270 we know the national museum has been waiting for long for us to move we will move after the building is completed it will take at least two years
8798271 we have a collection of 200 000 objects but we are able to display only 10 percent of them we want to have construction under the ground this will allow us to have more space and would ensure that there would not be any structural changes that would mar the original design
8798272 we have many important collections and are eager to show them this would be possible when we are able to modernise the museum
8798273 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases
8798274 they were allowed to conduct the search and seizure under the jurisdiction of homeland security due to security risks leading up to the republican national convention
8798275 just doesnt strike me as anything coming close to the period of 1982 to 1993 when thousands of s amp ls and banks had to be closed
8798276 that perhaps is the beginning of a return to greater consumer confidence that would build throughout 2009
8798277 the big natgas storage build is lending a bearish tone to the market even as everyone is still watching gustav closely
8798278 will refute all the rumors that say the american companies are the only ones benefiting from the american occupation
8798279 this action shows that every iraqi faces arrest and detention without any reason
8798280 the freeze of the mahdi army will continue for an open ended time
8798281 and anyone who breaks this freeze should not consider himself part of the ideological movement
8798282 i see him as having a rhetoric rather than a philosophy
8798283 se supone que pagas una entrada para ver el circuito y la competici n de varias categor as entre ellas las m s importantes las de gp2 y por supuesto la f1
8798284 algo que no me afecta directamente pero que me pareci penoso fue ver a un minusv lido en un hilo de sombra apartado del circuito porque no hab a acceso adaptado
8798285 lo mejor de todo es la imagen que han dado por la tv y prensa escrita ni un solo comentario de las miles de reclamaciones y de la desorganizaci n en el circuito hasta uno de los polic as nos dijo que estaba siendo un caos y que se le hab a ido de las manos a la organizaci n
8798286 las entradas que tenemos nosotros son de 375 euros evidentemente no son ni mucho menos un regalo
8798287 durante la carrera sugiri tambi n que los afectados ser an compensados
8798288 est claro que para el a o que viene queremos mejorar en comparaci n a este a o pero seguimos estando muy satisfechos
8798289 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
8798290 these storms have a tendency to change and so i dont have a scheduling update for you now
8798291 if its a major hurricane i think that they certainly need to show they learned lessons from three years ago both from a policy and perception standpoint
8798292 the republicans cant seem to catch a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8798293 the american people want to know the people they elected are paying attention care about them and are making decisions they need to make
8798294 the smart thing is not to poke their chests out and say what a great job theyre doing or going to do but just to do what needs to be done
8798295 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table
8798296 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8798297 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8798298 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8798299 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8798300 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year
8798301 i just havent been scoring the way i would like even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week
8798302 it was a fun tournament last year and i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament
8798303 but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8798304 id be making half as much as i am now
8798305 im very thankful hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game
8798306 ccleaner is a nice tool that cleans up browser cache temporary files recent documents history and other items to clear the internet explorer cache in a single click you may add a ccleaner button to the internet explorer toolbar
8798307 we had the type of relationship where wed be joking one minute then the next we would have a heart to heart he was very sincere
8798308 hes a man you could trust he loved his softball loved cars and of course loved his family
8798309 he wasnt just a partner i worked with he was a friend and he made me enjoy work each day
8798310 if i was having a bad day he would say you better change your attitude pal or were going to have a problem
8798311 i was right there when it happened im talking to him one minute hes gone the next minute the whole thing is playing over and over again and it is hard to forget
8798312 i want to remember him a different way all i can think of is the last seconds
8798313 i dont want to go back everything i did there i did with eric everything i learned we learned together
8798314 when i started the day shift we didnt know what we were building we learned by building lockers together
8798315 he loved his kids he loved being with the family he loved that scene wed always talk about that i knew the caring side the hard side the jokester side and they all played in perfectly together with eric
8798316 you take everything for granted id never thought for a thousands years this would happen i wish i would have paid more attention to our conversations and details
8798317 he would always have us laughing whether it was a trip to watkins glen or on the softball field
8798318 he was an awesome player and we hated him as our competition we would have won the title a few years but he always came up against us and did something big
8798319 one year he hit four home runs in the finals it was amazing we called him mr august because he was so hot
8798320 he was also very unselfish you could build a team around him he was the best left center fielder we had but he would play any position to help us win and make everyone else happy
8798321 would never yell at anybody if someone made an error hed never say anything he was like superman in left field we would never think he had a shot at a ball and at the last second hed throw his glove up and catch it
8798322 weve been talking a lot about eric about his dedication to his family how he never washed his jersey and so many things he did for us
8798323 and were all sitting around and waiting for him to come strutting around the corner with a hat on and his cut off kasey kahne t shirt
8798324 he was a fun loving guy then he met becky and became an amazing father
8798325 eric faced a lot of adversity hed have something go wrong and youd see him the next day and you never knew he had troubles
8798326 i gave up smoking and drinking and women last night
8798327 and it was the worst 15 minutes of my life
8798328 its country music all night long thats all we got for yall
8798329 holy mackerel look at all the country girls you got here in canton
8798330 also the article did not say but its important that rec
8798331 selfish silly immature people playing dress up and make believe
8798332 also the article did not say but its important that rec
8798333 its a step in the right direction i admit its not a big big step but we might start a trend of some sort
8798334 for instance weve talking about the possibility of forming food buying clubs where neighbors come together and buy whole sale food so they can buy it in bulk which is cheaper that makes it more affordable to buy organic and whole grain food and things like that thats one short term goal
8798335 it was very moving all week ive just had this great feeling and this topped all of it
8798336 it was very specific about what he will do when he is president
8798337 it was fantastic there must be a better word for it than fantastic said tom riley a farmer from cedar rapids iowa who with his wife drove to denver to see the speech
8798338 ever since sen hillary clinton spoke on tuesday it has been packed and it hasnt stopped
8798339 denver can be a cowtown but this week its felt like new orleans theres just an excited vibe and everyone has been looking forward to it
8798340 weve only put the show on hold but people are excited about it
8798341 denver can be a cowtown but this week its felt like new orleans theres just an excited vibe and everyone has been looking forward to it
8798342 the lessons of the action is when a decision is made to act accurate and timely information needs to be provided to retailers and consumers
8798343 the agency didnt hesitate to use its new authority in this case and it will not be shy about using this new tool to warn the public in the future when the health and safety of the public require this kind of immediate notice
8798344 the parents bought the bassinet after the previous death had the cpsc acted it simply would not have been for sale
8798345 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
8798346 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com
8798347 the reason to buy assets is to not incur liabilities
8798348 well one of the things its going to do is to help us give better presentations when were out in the community so that people can have a visual experience of what it is that we do
8798349 all you need to do is just take a look at the crowd thats gathering out here to see that there is a great need people in the city of binghamton are hungry and we at the hand of hope ministries just wanted to do what we could to help alleviate that problem
8798350 we had this mountain of packages sitting on the table
8798351 and you wash them inside hang them to dry so everyone sees them here and then you turn them inside out and hang them up to dry again
8798352 i think the strangest part of the whole project for all of us was being able to get past the fact of what they really were getting past the fact that it was a condom
8798353 when its a hard subject to talk about then you do it as a form of artwork it gets talk going and then you can bring knowledge about a subject
8798354 so when thats in the exhibit its going to be on the back seat of a car because thats where you would expect that age group to be active
8798355 because that sect of people would probably be a little bit older and a little bit wiser but still using some sort of protection for maybe children
8798356 that was kind of a play on words telling people they should wear their raincoats
8798357 planned parenthood took the brunt of this project because they donated boxes of condoms
8798358 features the iconic sounds of the fifties and sixties in a journey back to the 1958 springfield high school prom where the wonderettes betty jean cindy lou missy and suzy are four young girls with hopes and dreams as big as their crinoline skirts
8798359 when the school newspaper publishes an insensitive story students at berkeley high suddenly find themselves embroiled in a volatile controversy and even their teachers seem unprepared to deal with the repercussions its a sting thats worthy of the school mascot the sports teams at berkeley high are called the yellowjackets and the jacket is the name of the student run paper
8798360 berkeley rep is of course one of the places i was first exposed to theatre
8798361 and tony taccone is one of the best people in the country to develop a new play with so for me anyway this is more exciting in many ways than being produced in new york yellowjackets is a political play one that raises a lot of sensitive issues about race socioeconomics and education but its also a very personal play in that all of the events are based on things that really happened while i was a student at berkeley high so to share my work with berkeley for the first time in a play that is actually about berkeley is quite special
8798362 is a great fit with the skills of the companys actors singers and musicians
8798363 juxtaposing the romanticism of the past with the cynicism of the present and ultimately revealing the foolishness of living in the past
8798364 a blood red comic road adventure two iraqi war veterans logan marshall green and corey stoll badly mutilated but as fiercely patriotic as ever make their way home from a military hospital in germany their marauding adventure across america takes them to crawford texas where they meet up with their commander in chief dan butler and offer a surefire solution to all his problems
8798365 are invited to bring friends and family to experience the smash hit movie musical in a whole new way by singing along to the songs they love
8798366 an independent single mother who owns a small hotel on an idyllic greek island donna streep is about to let go of sophie amanda seyfried the spirited daughter shes raised alone
8798367 on a quest to find the identity of her father to walk her down the aisle she brings back three men from donnas past to the mediterranean paradise they visited 20 years earlier over 24 chaotic magical hours new love will bloom and old romances will be rekindled on this lush island full of possibilities
8798368 the general pitch level or average range of a vocal or instrumental part in a musical composition
8798369 a funny sexy and poignant look at the journey of three all american girls as they mature from cheerleaders to sorority sisters to independent women spanning the turbulent 60s through the late 80s vanities celebrates the lives and loves of three best friends caught up in rapidly changing times
8798370 a whole new scene no longer just a coda or epilogue set years after the ending of the original play
8798371 the 60s and early 70s were arguably the richest era for pop music in the whole 20th century from the beatles to burt bacharach to even broadway which as we know was enjoying sort of its last gasp at the top of the hit parade with everything from hair to hello dolly since vanities the play takes place over that entire period i heard the music in the piece right away and since the story revolves around a friendship between three women thats what i zeroed in on for inspiration the girl group music of the supremes and shirelles the songs of lesley gore and ellie greenwich moving through the decade into the more soulful sounds of legends like janis joplin and tina turner and the singer songwriters like joni mitchell carly simon and carole king interestingly enough those last three just had a best selling book published about their music and the complicated relationship between them called girls like us one thing thats different about the musical is that it goes beyond the timeframe of the original play and adds a new scene set 15 years later that takes us to about 1990 by which time pop music obviously had a whole different kind of sound so we have some fun with that for one song
8798372 but hopefully the whole thing is filtered through a theatrical sensibility and my own style and sounds cohesive as a score i love jacks original play and these three characters and ive been having the time of life musicalizing all of it with him
8798373 if you watch the film not many get around him and he can squash you
8798374 that is my goal on every play drive them back as far as i can right onto their back
8798375 i love it my dad tells me he wants a decleater on every play and thats what i try to give him thats what coaches like to see
8798376 we see a lot of nose guards and we want to make sure theyre neutralized
8798377 im learning the snaps learning the plays learning how to read linebackers
8798378 its a good experience because now i know every position and it will help me for college
8798379 i get to feel the history of the people who played there
8798380 the baseball coach asked me to come out and i considered that sc likes it that i play three sports for people who say focus on one sport im always going to be focused on football but its nice to enjoy the sports im playing basketball prepares me with my footwork and track is more lifting and helps with strength
8798381 we need to get these kids home we promised their parents wed get them on the bus and get them home
8798382 we know we got the win and that we worked hard in practice
8798383 working hard and the training and everything we came out conditioned we were ready
8798384 were trained to hit more and not just run around people were trained to hit and then run i think that helps a lot
8798385 you know theyre a good team i dont want to take anything away from them
8798386 but at the same time at halftime we talked about turnovers we talked about penalties and we talked about poor tackling
8798387 the same thing occurred in the second half turnovers missed tackles and penalties you just cant do that on any friday night in this case a thursday night and expect to come out ahead too many times
8798388 those types of charges that the united states was involved in instigating it you know just are without foundation and just ludicrous plain and simple
8798389 it needs to stop blaming others for the aggression that it carried out against a neighbour
8798390 russia is doing a great job on its own in isolating itself
8798391 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states has specially created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and to benefit one of the candidates in the struggle for the post of president of the united states
8798392 its not only that the us administration could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army
8798393 an ardent follower of dr b r ambedkar and says that every social activist must know his marx and ambedkar in india
8798394 you will find most of the slums populated by dalits the minorities particularly muslims are at the second place and some backward castes and classes are also there
8798395 i always considered the slums as a kind of mini bharat because they are kind of conglomeration of various cultures and different languages and this is what makes them unique
8798396 in spite of this diversity in slums people live like one entity i mean you wont find language chauvinism or cultural chauvinism so a slum becomes a representative of the country itself in its diversity
8798397 from every point of view women are the worst sufferers in slums their plight arising from the lack of toilets is a case in point
8798398 this is all well little alice but there is a third thing you must do
8798399 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8798400 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8798401 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8798402 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8798403 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8798404 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8798405 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8798406 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8798407 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8798408 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8798409 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8798410 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8798411 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8798412 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8798413 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8798414 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8798415 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8798416 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8798417 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8798418 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8798419 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8798420 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8798421 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8798422 how to self destruct making the least of whats left of your career
8798423 true learning occurs independent of and sometimes inspite of the work done in pursuit of a degree learning happens any time you embrace your incompetence as a challenge to learn new skills
8798424 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8798425 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8798426 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8798427 plea deal may represent kilpatricks best option mayor might be forced to resign before hearing
8798428 it was apparent at this meeting that the governor did not presume kilpatricks innocence
8798429 to the contrary at this meeting the governor and her staff had prepared a blackboard scenario in which his presumption of innocence was ignored and significantly undercut
8798430 the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad

8798434 isnt it refreshing to have a big nation just blatantly invade another smaller nation i mean russia just rolled over georgia for the money
8798435 my ummah people were given five things which were not given to anyone except them for them the smell from the mouth of a fasting person is more sweeter in the sight of allah than the fragrant smell of musk on their behalf the fish in the sea seek forgiveness until they break their fast allah prepares and decorates a special garden in jannah heaven everyday and then says to it the time is near when my faithful servants shall cast aside the great trials of the world and come to you in this month of ramadan the evil minded syaitan devil is chained so as not to reach unto those evils to which they normally reach during other months besides ramadan on the last night of ramadan they are forgiven
8798436 o rasulullah messenger of allah s a w is that last night laylatul qadr
8798437 no but it is on right that a servant should be given his reward on having completed his service
8798438 the reward for fasting i myself will give because it is for me alone
8798439 well hopefully this is bad thing number three for someone and not number one
8798440 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8798441 ive taken a lot of heat from my critics for saying obama inspires me with his speeches well my critics can go to hell

8798454 in the weak market for consumer spending there is a bright spot apple inc the computer and electronic device maker is attracting potential buyers like never before and is getting top marks in customer satisfaction
8798455 a survey of more than 4 400 people between august 4 and august 12 conducted by rbc capital markets and changewave research showed that 34 plan to buy a mac laptop in the next 90 days compared with 31 in may those planning to buy a mac desktop rose to 30 from 27 meanwhile 81 of those who recently bought an apple product in the past 90 days were very satisfied while only 58 dell inc buyers and 55 hewlett packard co buyers said the same
8798456 the investment banking division of the royal bank of canada said thursday that apples back to school promotion is showing signs that it will drive the company to
8798457 in a report to clients analyst mike abramsky cited proprietary data from his firms recent iq changewave panel which suggests that massive back to school mac sales could see the cupertino based company report year over year growth of 44 percent to 3 04 million units for the three month period ending september
8798458 apple appears to be doing far better in terms of mac sales than one might have expected this quarter says rbc analyst mike abramsky
8798459 but the mini lives and even though 599 is no longer anywhere near a dirt cheap price for a computer it remains the cheapest mac it also comes in a super small package thats still fun and distinctive so its the subject of my fourth excessively in depth mac vs pc price comparison my goal as always is to gauge whether you pay a mac tax when you buy a mini instead of a roughly comparable windows pc
8798460 while apples isync and mobileme syncing services work fine for many users others have experienced a plethora of problems ranging from data not syncing to inability to access services such as the calendar on the mobileme website
8798461 for many users the various fixes have worked but sometimes these problems are temporary and other times nothing seems to fix the problems for some users for users in this situation or for users who are only getting intermittent relief from sync problems they may wish to fully and completely reset their calendar and contacts synchronization data this will wipe clean any contacts and calendar data on all devices except for one and then re propagate the data back from the one source and hopefully bypass data inconsistencies and other glitches with the current synchronization setup that are giving the user troubles
8798462 whats free looks like mac os x just works and is actually linux the answer is gos which recently launched a new beta that builds on the distros initial success and adds new tools like integrated google gadgets for linux
8798463 when it launched onto the scene late last year gos which stands for good os made quite a splash for getting linux into the us retail giant walmart through a partnership with pc manufacturer everex gos brought linux to your parents generation via walmart
8798464 but chances are if they picked up a gos equipped machine mom and dad would have no idea they were running linux like the xandros distro that asus packages with the eee pc gos doesnt trumpet its open source credentials or advertise its infinite customization options it just works

8798543 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8798544 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8798545 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things
8798546 they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8798547 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8798548 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8798549 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8798550 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8798551 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8798552 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8798553 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8798554 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8798555 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8798556 its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
8798557 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8798558 i have a speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys
8798559 i have not forgotten where i came from i havent forgotten who got me here its because of all of you
8798560 colorado is probably one of the most important states in this election
8798561 if john mccain does not win this state he has a very very limited chance of winning the white house and so we think that tonight by bringing these tens of thousands of coloradans in by turning it into a working organizing experience were going to take great steps to winning the state in the fall
8798562 ive been able to do that since the minor leagues
8798563 ive always been able to drive in runs its something im proud of and i like to be in that situation late in the game
8798564 the only way youre going to be in the place we are now 34 games above 500 is by everybody doing their part

8798566 it takes a special person to be able to do that and he does it on a pretty consistent basis especially if you give him anything to hit

8798578 in a 2 d system you have to account for the fact that people can lean into the detection zone
8798579 in the end that equals out safetyeyes additional reaction time
8798580 think of all the wiring and development work you save when you start eliminating light curtains and electronic gates
8798581 you just reprogram the safetyeye to accommodate the line changes

8798586 whenever someone considers purchasing something new one of the initial reactions is to determine if the current model s will be updated in the near future this true for automobiles gadgets electronics and of course computers this post will provide insight into how apple updates and refreshes their line of macintosh computers with particular emphasis on the macbook and macbook pro lines
8798587 apple appears to be censoring discussion of a display manufacturing defect in the and have not acknowledging that the defect even exists notebook computers especially 17s are an expensive investment to have just go belly up shortly after they come out of warranty some people have had their machines die right after the one year warranty expires
8798588 this site has been made available to the owners of 17
8798589 i encourage you to post your information and photographs here as apple constantly close down lock or delete any threads containing manufactoring information photographs or links to external sites discussing this problem on their forums
8798590 this kind of action by apple suggests to me that they are aware of a known defect do not want to address it and are scared of the bad publicity that would result from a recall or repair extension program lets not forget the recent battery recall
8798591 if like me you find apples blatant censorship and refusal to address this problem unpalatable bear in mind that when launched this machine was the top of the line powerbook and cost around 3000 us then post your powerbooks information here and together we will hopefully get apple to face up to the fact that they sold 17
8798592 we all know that installing 4 gb of ram will speed up a macbook and make the whole experience that little bit more smoother and quicker but what can you do now for free that will help speed your bundle of joy along and keep its user happier i will tell you 6 things that will help
8798593 when youre looking for the leaders and front runners in technology you can be assured to find apples name there
8798594 all of their computers are great but their latest laptops are highly advanced and efficient these computers give you better performance and their efficiency is excellent
8798595 apples laptops have had some interesting encounters at airport security checkpoints
8798596 users dont have to remove their macbooks from their bags anymore thanks to new checkpoint friendly laptop bags its a hassle to remove laptops and place them in bins so these bags allow x ray machines to screen laptops from inside bags the bags are designed using guidelines provided by the tsa which wants a clear view of the laptop through the bag
8798597 solid state drives are fast becoming popular replacements for hard drives especially in laptops but experts caution that ssds arent as secure as commonly thought
8798598 ssds may offer better data security than traditional hard drives but they do not completely erase data and are vulnerable to physical hacks from light sources like an ultraviolet laser experts say
8798599 overall its easier to delete data from ssds than from hard drives which can be a good or bad data is stored on electrons in ssds and getting rid of electrons flushes out the data in hard drives the data has to be overwritten or physically damaged to prevent it from being read
8798600 although declining a separate announcement intel at its developer forum has formally introduced the core2 duo s its first factory stock processor based on the same small package technology that was rushed into use for the
8798601 although running on the same 1 066 mhz system bus and with the same 6 mb of level 2 cache as newer core2 duos the s and its accompanying chipset are 60 percent smaller overall while the processor itself uses 17 watts at its thermal design peak versus 20 watts for its apple focused ancestor both also keep the same hardware virtualization and trusted execution as for their larger counterparts
8798602 intels developer forum has revealed the processors likely to underpin the first refresh of the macbook air ultraportable
8798603 slipping underneath the radar amidst talk of nehalem and other next generation technology intel at the san francisco edition of its developer forum this week announced its first regularly available processor based on the same very small chip packaging that made the macbook air possible
8798604 nicknamed the core2 duo s the 1 6 ghz and 1 86 ghz parts share the same basic architecture as chips released in july but consume about 60 percent less surface area through both a smaller main processor and smaller bridge chips used to interface with memory and peripherals
8798605 the core2 duo s which first appeared in apples macbook air trims both size and power consumption by a significant degree
8798606 the shrunken core2 duo processor that apple dropped into its iconic air is now available for public consumption
8798607 for some users the new generation of ultraportable notebooks comes close to embodying the holy grail for road warriors
8798608 however while pundits and technology journalists have lavished attention on these products skeptics have raised questions for instance is there anything really special about these devices or do they just represent old technology in new packaging are users as enthusiastic about these tiny laptops as the pundits are will they fade away like so many other next big things and perhaps the oddest question what do we call these things anyway
8798609 with the macbook pro apple discarded the old pc card slot in favor of expresscard 34 a more compact expansion slot that offers greater transfer speeds and an increasing array of uses the expresscard format has a couple of advantages over the old pc card format
8798610 first its narrower expresscard 34 cards are 34mm wide compared with the 54mm pc cards
8798611 here is just a sampling of the expresscards available its by no means encyclopedic but it should give you an idea of how you can expand your laptops powers
8798612 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8798613 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8798614 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8798615 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21 st century the american promise alive
8798616 because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8798617 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on nov 4
8798618 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8798619 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8798620 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is that youre on your own
8798621 that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8798622 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8798623 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped my life and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8798624 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8798625 this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio on the brink of retirement finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work
8798626 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8798627 that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8798628 and it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8798629 mit tiefer dankbarkeit und gro er demut akzeptiere ich die nominierung f r die pr sidentschaft der vereinigten staaten

8798631 ich werde den krieg im irak verantwortungsbewusst beenden und den kampf gegen el kaida und die taliban in afghanistan zu ende f hren
8798632 ich werde neue partnerschaften bauen um die bedrohungen des 21 jahrhunderts zu besiegen

8798640 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8798641 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8798642 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8798643 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition

8798647 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change
8798648 like george bush john mccain suggests spending 10 million in iraq barack obama and joe biden believe we ought to bring the war in iraq to a responsible end
8798649 barack obama and joe biden know that this is not just about turning red states blue its about turning our country around

8798701 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more senator obama said in the excerpts released to the media

8798714 but there has been a cross flow of jewels and styles designs and jewels from india have influenced styles across europe
8798715 primarily the focus is on quality buyers want nothing but the best and with a rich history moreover all period jewellery has multiple prices because their supply is limited buyers need to be educated about period jewellery and we have been trying to project our showcase to potential buyers through brochures catalogues and exhibition dos
8798716 this year alone we sold an important diamond corsage belonging to empress eugenie wife of nepolean iii of france last year we auctioned two strings of the famed baroda pearls and a collection of magnificent jewels which were the former property of anita delgado the fifth wife of the maharaja jagjit singh of kapurthala
8798717 heritage jewellery from india has been attracting the attention of the west since the 1920s and the 1930s when leading firms like cartier started retailing antique indian jewellery as well as incorporating elements of old jewellery in their latest designs

8798728 the collapse of zoom is a result of matter beyond our control only last year zoom airlines made profit but that turned into a loss in the last year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8798729 the price of oil resulted in our fuel bill jumping by nearly 50 million in one year and we could not recover that from passengers who had already booked their flights

8798736 we wanted to convey that we are a travel and touring company without having to specifically say that in our company name having a travel domain solved this problem for us as it clearly says we are travel but allows us to build our brand name simply as exposure we like the word exposure because our tours are exactly that
8798737 the travel clearly communicates that we are in the business of selling travel however in the online travel world people have been taught to hunt for the best price not to hunt for the best experience we hope that by having a travel site it will give us a stamp of approval that provides credibility so people actually want to come back and use us again

8798803 those who thought lloyd carr was too boring are psyched but with everything that happened this summer the traditional michigan fan is very very skittish

8798810 now youre just going to have a certain number of games to watch them on its a bigger challenge it makes the battle more exciting
8798811 it was just time for change because everyone kind of knew exactly what we were going to do
8798812 but that was the arrogance of being at michigan you know what they are going to run its up to you to stop them because our players are better than you
8798813 at first people were nervous because no one has been through it and they didnt know what to expect
8798814 its really a new chapter in the book a different chapter coach has brought in some things that were successful the thing that makes michigan michigan those things are still in place those who stay will be champions michigan will be michigan
8798815 we are honoured to be part of the 100 years as it the cruise 100 years ago put forward the us as a world power he said

8798834 my wife and i see differently on different subjects weve come together and have had a successful marriage for over 20 years because we realize there is greater good and greater goal in staying married and not letting differences get in the way

8798879 so the other day me and my friends were at the club voodoo and i am going around making some new friends and having a good time well this one guy somehow works his way into my group but then ends up not leaving us alone all night and he was a really annoying person that you just dont want to talk to he kept making every interaction in the club awkward and would not leave until he actually gets a hint and goes home
8798880 how do you deal with people who you just want to leave you alone
8798881 hey guys how do you deal with people when you just cant get them to leave you alone
8798882 yeah thats interesting so check this out the other day i am at club voodoo rest of story
8798883 hey guys how do you deal with people when you just caaaaannt exaggerated cant to show frustration with the situation and convey more personality get them to leave you alone
8798884 yeah thats interesting so check this out the other day i am at club voodoo and i walk in with a group of my friends and random people we met on the way social and there is a decent amount of people in the club we are all having a great time fun and meeting lots of cool new people social
8798885 hey guys how do you deal with people when you just caaaaannt get them to leave you alone
8798886 like he is so out of place he was walking around with a harley davison motorcycle hat on and like this tainted banana colored polo you know when someone is clearly just lost and not sure what he or she is doing kind of like that guy over there point to someone similar

8798891 think of it batman to never again walk on a summers day with a hot wind in your face and a warm hand to hold oh yes id kill for that
8798892 strong strong speech i thought it was excellent this is why he got nominated and he came through there was nothing weak or amateur about it more importantly and quite characteristically obamas speech defied and shattered the conceptual boxes that pundits have been trying to squeeze him into
8798893 if his convention speech tonight is any indication barack obama has finally signaled that progressive economic populism is going to be the central thrust of democrats campaign in the stretch run of the 2008 election the speech is probably the most populist national speech obama has given
8798894 tonights speech was exactly what it needed to be a proclamation of a new political era and the rebel yell of a newly remade political party the last 40 years have been hard and miserable for those of us who believed in such quaint ideals as compassion and the constitution and the common good but because enough of us are finally ready for them to be over they will be because in a democracy thats how its supposed to work even though wed long ago given up hope that it could ever work that way again
8798895 obama proved tonight again that hes one of the few most gifted public communicators of the last generation but this time he proved it by not excelling in soaring rhetoric or delivering a speech that will be remembered for the ages rather he recognized that tonights speech didnt have to be an effort to join the rhetorical hall of fame obama has been getting hammered for weeks now by republicans as a puffed up showman who loves the sound of his own voice when it fills stadiums this clearly created some consternation among dems and obama advisers and obama adjusted accordingly no question obama hit plenty of emotional and rhetorical high notes as he ran through his bio and promised a tough fight with the republicans but the speech was strong because of its specificity because it laid out a detailed case as to why hes the right choice and mccains the wrong choice
8798896 obama went on the attack his fluid tough and forcefully delivered speech indicates that he will be a formidable and potentially devastating opponent in the fall presidential debates anyone who cant see that just doesnt get it
8798897 i have heard barack obama deliver speeches better but in this acceptance speech obama did exactly what he needed to do to set the stage for the fall campaign
8798898 i also actively try to convince people to go out and vote because i think its important to vote
8798899 for a thriving democracy we have a pretty low turnout when it comes to voting in america and so i believe the people should speak and elect a leader that they want if they speak then i think they should elect the right person
8798900 ive been active in the music business for the past five or six years ything just keeps going from strength to strength its been getting better and better more and more exciting im more and more confident and im more and more relaxed with what i am doing

8798908 one hundred years after the emancipation proclamation the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
8798909 we can never be satisfied as long as the negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality
8798910 we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
8798911 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote
8798912 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8798913 i have a dream that one day down in alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification one day right there in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers
8798914 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8798915 in a sense we have come to our nations capital to cash a check
8798916 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your home and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars that you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8798917 now is the time to make real the promises of democracy now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood now is the time to make justice a reality for all of gods children it would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment this sweltering summer of the negros legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality nineteen sixty three is not an end but a beginning
8798918 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8798919 my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing land where my fathers died land of the pilgrims pride from every mountainside let freedom ring
8798920 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we chall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8798921 r wants to know what youre doing with his vest
8798922 i think this is the first time ive seen this kind of treatment given to the ed theme i wonder if there is other series that has done this
8798923 i wonder if there is other series that has done this of course there are series where the ed song runs at the same time as the actual story but thats not what i meant here im looking for a specifically created ed that mirrors the story of the actual episode
8798924 authentic in public readings discourses and disputes and that nobody might dare or presume to reject it on any pretence
8798925 dont believe everything you read theres a lot of rumor and speculation about the kindle one thing i can tell you for sure is that there will be no new version of the kindle this year a new version is possible sometime next year at the earliest
8798926 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8798927 i wasnt prepared to stand up and articulate views that i found hypocritical
8798928 if you havent got anything good to say about people its best to leave it alone ill shake hands and walk away

8798930 unsere regierung l sst unsere kollegen in neckarsulm im stich cdu und fdp schlagen sich jetzt beim vw gesetz auf die seite des porsche vorstands
8798931 singt das lied von zuffenhausen der mir versprochene termin bei dem wir ber das vw gesetz sprechen wollten hat bis zum heutigen tage nicht stattgefunden er hat noch nicht mal einen angeboten
8798932 i enjoyed the end of his speech where he said we are all connected and we dont have time to stop theres so much ahead
8798933 i liked to hear about where he came from and where hes been
8798934 he spoke very eloquent about the need to help the homeless veterans on the street
8798935 were having it rough but obama has got what we need
8798936 we nearly had the scoop on this too but it took too long for me to get an internet connection damn herald got in ten minutes earlier
8798937 local frogs that just happen to secrete natures death juice
8798938 there are in the body politic economic and social many and grave evils and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them there should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man whether politician or business man every evil practice whether in politics in business or in social life i hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker every man who on the platform or in book magazine or newspaper with merciless severity makes such attack provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful
8798939 i did get an apology email from the local ugs representative by the end of the day he left all the previous emails chained below it i find it rewarding to know that my message exchanged a few hands at corporate ugs before making it back to me hopefully the right people are made aware of the situation and can improve on the process that after all is the main intent of my rant
8798940 i was thinking this morning that dad and mother are smiling and looking down on us smiling at what is happening at this point
8798941 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change
8798942 if you believe its time for a change then vote for barack obama
8798943 i accept your nomination for president of the united states
8798944 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story
8798945 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8798946 this moment this election is our chance to keep the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8798947 its dangerous for the campaign because it plays into a larger narrative about whether or not its truly a celebrity candidacy or is there substantive things hes proposing for the country
8798948 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8798949 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8798950 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8798951 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8798952 yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair
8798953 but we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
8798954 and it is that promise that forty five years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8798955 astroland has been a real anchor for coney island over the years
8798956 so we felt that with all the uncertainty over the future of coney island that now would be a good time to pay tribute to them
8798957 when the opportunity to partner with the devil rays presented itself we jumped at it
8798958 theres a lot of energy theyre the talk of the nation
8798959 watching this club come together and figure out how they can be a team has been a wonderful story
8798960 we keep watching when they play big series when they play boston and when they play the yankees and they just keep rolling on and i think everybody believes theyre for real and theyre not gonna fold

8798970 there are very few possibilities for the eu to have an influence on russian decision making in a region so close to its borders
8798971 there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8798972 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8798973 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8798974 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8798975 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8798976 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8798977 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder forless
8798978 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8798979 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8798980 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8798981 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8798982 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8798983 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8798984 we believe that into the period of 2009 youll start to see economic growth picking up
8798985 if you go with the forecasts which were released by the reserve bank in august you see growth by the june quarter 2009 improving to two and a quarter per cent and then by the end of next year to two and a half
8798986 id much rather be up front about that with the australian people rather than pretending that its any different its a big challenge and its been a big challenge frankly since day one
8798987 there is no patrolling across the coastline so that we can have an idea of which ship is responsible for the leak here there is a route through which hundreds of ships pass everyday it is very complicated to find which one it was
8798988 and i would refer you to department of defence who would have more on their recent conversations with their military
8798989 constructive and focused on the challenges posed by extremists in the federally administered tribal area and the north west frontier in pakistan
8798990 the pakistani military faces a conventional military challenge from india and the extremist challenge
8798991 kayani understands the situation and is moving toward combating the extremist problem on the border with afghanistan
8798992 im pleased that hes moving in that direction and that he is actually operating
8798993 and again were trying to figure out how that fits into bringing pressure onto that border to work to minimise the cross border operations from pakistan into afghanistan on the case of the insurgents its just going to take some time
8798994 there is a growing complexity and coordination among extremist groups there an almost syndicate like behaviour that has resulted in new and ever more sophisticated attacks on coalition forces
8798995 the safe havens in the border regions provide launching pads for these sorts of attacks and they need to be shut down
8798996 very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be and that the military to military relationship were building with pakistan is getting stronger every day
8798997 for me more than anything this was a chance to better understand a very complex challenge in a critical part of the world and to try to do that through the eyes of the leadership who live and work and fight there every single day
8798998 terms of learning as well as continuing to look at where we can support and how we can understand each other better with a very clear need from the united states standpoint and from the pakistani standpoint that we have got to figure out a way to get at this problem
8798999 it continues to be an extraordinarily complex problem in pakistan
8799000 we need to continue to press on it there are areas that we can do better there are areas that the pakistan military can do better we understand that its an area i think we can all improve on but it is not going to be something that gets solved overnight
8799001 as i have come to know him his goal is to do the right thing by pakistan
8799002 hes an extraordinary individual and his ultimate principles and goals are to do whats best for pakistan and everything hes done in our engagement indicates thats absolutely the case
8799003 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power

8799006 the moving filaments serve as nanoshuttles which transport and deliver cargo in a controlled manner however cytoskeletal filaments rotate around their longitudinal axis due to intrinsic properties of filaments and motors we have found that this rotation is not disturbed in the case of small cargo quantum dots
8799007 however the fact that the velocity of microtubule gliding was not affected shows that kinesin driven microtubules make flexible responsive and effective molecular shuttles for nanotransport applications
8799008 quantum dot assisted characterization of microtubule rotations during cargo transport
8799009 when filament rotation had been studied previously optical detection relied on filament supercoiling or periodic sideways deflections of distinctive microtubule structures
8799010 as a consequence these experiments had a limited accuracy with respect to quantification of the rotational periodicities and were based on the deliberate construction of impaired gliding assays or defective filaments in contrast in our experiments given the contour length of 60 nm for the kinesin 1 constructs we expected that the quantum dots used as optical reporters would have no impact on the rotations
8799011 specifically we have used the technique to characterize the movement of filamentous nanoshuttles that glide over surfaces coated with linear molecular motor proteins
8799012 this was being done by tracking the 3 d paths of quantum dots being attached to the filaments
8799013 to our knowledge we are the first ones to report that although rotation is stopped transport of large cargo is still perfectly possible using a processive motor

8799020 the inquiry officer found that the allegations were most likely the result of a young afghan soldier at the forward operating base being culturally offended by what he believed to be harsh treatment of an afghan by non afghan personnel
8799021 you will also learn by reading our blog that two arts journalists david hoppe and travis dinicola in indianapolis accepted 2 750 in renewal fellowship grants from the arts council why are journalists being paid off by our arts council

8799025 i have to be aware of where my feet are at all times
8799026 we all die i just have a little more information than most people about how my end will come im not afraid of death it is a part of the cycle of life society makes it scary i feel that ive lived 3 lifetimes if i die i die but i want to be here for my daughters and be a grandmother
8799027 you just go through it you let it come to you then go through it its your resistance that tries to keep it at bay i breathe through the pain when i was working i had horrible back spasms i couldnt make my 30 minute commute without stopping to stretch several times i would get out of my car stretch and breathe
8799028 nothing of a hurricane nature yet but you can tell that its coming
8799029 we still cant send workers into certain areas because the roads have been cut off and some communities are not accessible
8799030 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
8799031 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8799032 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president
8799033 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8799034 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8799035 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8799036 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8799037 finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8799038 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8799039 he did everything he needed to do he gracefully dissected john mccain and then set out his own vision and clearly everyone got it
8799040 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8799041 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8799042 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8799043 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8799044 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8799045 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8799046 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8799047 failure to respond is a direct result of broken politics in washington
8799048 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8799049 ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors
8799050 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8799051 finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8799052 restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
8799053 we certainly talked about the complexity of the challenges that we have in the border area the pressure that we believe needs to be applied there for lots of reasons not the least of which is the effect its having on the fight in afghanistan
8799054 a very clear need from a us standpoint and from the pakistani standpoint that we have got to figure out a way to get at this problem
8799055 is undertaking operations that were not ongoing a few months ago
8799056 i am encouraged that hes taking action and i also think its going to take some time
8799057 expectations for instantaneous results are probably a little bit too high
8799058 the meeting was mainly to continue to discuss ongoing operations against extremists in the border region and to work together to find better ways to solve those problems
8799059 jennifer balbier senior vice president of product development and i were seeing deep reds and dark browns on the runways so we came up with a collection based on chocolate and cherries
8799060 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8799061 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8799062 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8799063 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8799064 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
8799065 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us

8799068 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
8799069 the fcc does not know what comcast did or did not do the evidence in the record is thin and conflicting
8799070 it brought together my interest in art in my own italian heritage and in politics and labor into one story
8799071 and i literally went up to him after the class and asked if anyone had done a documentary and he said no and i said im going to do one
8799072 they were making monuments for cemeteries but they were also producing public monuments and carvings for churches and other public buildings and private buildings too
8799073 the irony was that in creating this beauty and creating memorials for other people the dust generated by that process was killing them
8799074 in italy the scalpellini in particular were given wine as part of their job
8799075 they got money bread and wine and it was thought to make them stronger and to enhance their endurance and it was just part of their culture and to come to a country where you werent supposed to drink any wine i think seemed absurd to them
8799076 the stone cutters in italy were traditionally itinerant once you finished a cathedral in a town theres not a lot of other work to do so they were accustomed to traveling
8799077 they would go to work on the cathedral in st paul for a number of years and then move on to the next job
8799078 the irony was that in creating this beauty and creating memorials for other people the dust generated by that process was killing them and many of them died in their 40s and it was rare to live past 50
8799079 they took a dollar a day less pay in exchange for getting this ventilation equipment this suction equipment installed in all the sheds and its a really remarkable reversal because no stonecutters in vermont who started after 1938 contracted silicosis
8799080 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8799081 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8799082 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible

8799086 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8799087 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8799088 that is honestly the first time ive been asked that question
8799089 and until then ill be sharing mine with him ill have two more by next year
8799090 it was an honor to receive this last year and its an honor to receive it this year thank you very much
8799091 working very hard since the release of shadow of the colossus
8799092 i was offered playboy last year and again a couple of months ago and i did turn them down but thats not to say i wouldnt consider it in the future
8799093 ill be honest with you i felt like i was comfortable and i knew everything last year but until you get out there and youre doing it you have no clue what youre doing
8799094 ill be so much more relaxed and be able to just have the game come to me
8799095 whereas last year in the first game i was forcing things a little bit too much i didnt know quite what i was doing and this year i feel like there will be a better calmness throughout the whole game
8799096 it allows you to expose the defenses and you can potentially put up so many points and so much yardage against a team but ultimately it falls on the quarterback to get the team in the right place thats whats so great about the offense because all of the responsibility is on the guy calling the plays thats whats so fun about it
8799097 we know that where we were last year will be hanging over us for a while but its our job this year to be a whole new team and to continue to focus on this year and know that last year is motivation for us to become a better team and become a more successful team i guess im just really focusing and always keep reminding myself that football is just a game
8799098 you think things are going good and thats football just one play its just going to make me work that much harder
8799099 its something a little setback but ill be ready to go by next season and i plan on being ready for otas organized team activities and minicamps
8799100 well its going to definitely be a full evaluation process to elect a new president but we have some viable candidates that can do a great job
8799101 i look at blu ray being the obvious short term differentiator but if everything goes to digital download and over time it will then the blu ray device no longer has the same competitive advantage or the benefit is not as strong as the feature is
8799102 perhaps maybe five years maybe seven years i think the challenge with digital distribution is more because of piped to the home bandwidth than the technology within the systems
8799103 its exceptional value innovative design and unparalleled focus on safety
8799104 if your screwing with the man dont get caught and if you do get caught make sure its not for something where theyre looking to set an example

8799107 not everyone can be reached by phone and not everyone can be reached by flyer
8799108 my background is very very strong and i have credentials in the book ill be happy to let you look at them
8799109 i want you to feel comfortable with me being the warden at this facility and know that my job is to protect you and your family and not have any escapes thats the ultimate goal
8799110 weve never had an escape at a facility with a stun fence though
8799111 to me i dont see a problem with it to me its good
8799112 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident

8799121 im excited about the future possibilities in our online casinos industry
8799122 because i know in the long run its all going to work out just fine
8799123 but i am confident of long term gains that will help drive the online casinos market area forward
8799124 the last thing i want to do is send people home because thats against our companys mission statement
8799125 and also because we can reallocate our human capital to work on other projects that will be beneficial while the consumer market slows down
8799126 and i think as we look forward a lot will depend on the behavior of consumers if they choose to spend their money well get out of the slow times fast if however on the other hand they decided to save it or pay off debt were looking at a more bear market
8799127 its true were laying off workers because of the economy but the ones were laying off are employees that contribute little to our operations our best employees continue to hold their jobs and will continue with us as long as they maintain their excellent records further were going to reward our online casinos market analysts who are in high demand with a cost of living raise plus 2 of their salaries
8799128 we can weather the economic down turn by saving our liquid capital down sizing and then bursting out when things turnaround for the better
8799129 you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

8799132 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body
8799133 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
8799134 we started the school year with 60 bus routes for our regular bus routes last year we had about 80
8799135 we have the last addresses of the kids so maybe theyve moved and so forth we are going through a process of balancing

8799142 however when the family of dr siddiqui saw the photograph of the young boy they immediately recognized him and said that he was aafias son
8799143 the pakistan government was alerted that something had happened that aafias photograph was no longer there
8799144 he agreed with me but he couldnt say anything because hed get in trouble
8799145 a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8799146 hes angry and ready for a fight he is innocent we will try this case it is nothing but a false accusation
8799147 after a very difficult 17 months i feel like i have finally been validated
8799148 i am relieved to find that even federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender
8799149 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
8799150 it was a game we felt we had to win
8799151 its a big win for us this was a great game
8799152 as it is a patriotic year with the olympics and an election i wanted to focus the playboy com fall style guide on an americana theme
8799153 were more open about approaching and bringing services in to ps3 and psp
8799154 we cant support all the needs of the consumer and there are great companies providing services on the pc already so were very open to provide the opportunity to those companies to reach our user base as well
8799155 already making more money with the games than we are losing with the hardware
8799156 it is the only thing that gets me really emotional
8799157 if i were 40 years younger i would be a doctor
8799158 no i would choose again to be a singer please dont think me arrogant if i say that i have a certain instinct for singing which i do not have for medicine i believe i can transmit feelings and emotions that makes me fulfilled not just as an artist but as a person
8799159 this is not a macho statement but i prefer to listen to men i like sinatra he is the best i try to imitate him but i love elton john too sting is also a great artist and phil collins
8799160 the two were related by ancestry and united by destiny
8799161 i am not diana the film is not about diana
8799162 the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get the young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana
8799163 but they did not need to and should not have done it
8799164 georgiana and diana are related to start with georgiana was dianas great great great great aunt and they married as girl women in their late teens after a sheltered upbringing probably with a romantic notion of what marriage is to men who understood the marriage contract differently
8799165 one of the resonances with diana is that georgiana was one of the first celebrities
8799166 when her face appeared in newspapers they sold more copies but for me the most fundamental connection between their lives is that georgiana did lots of things she wasnt supposed to and diana did the same the establishment has never liked rebellious women particularly if theyre sexual women
8799167 although there are similarities between georgianas life and dianas there are millions of instances where it doesnt have any parallels at all
8799168 the thing is to be able to see her story in its own right and not as a coded version of princess dianas
8799169 because she wore them in her hair actors get sent so many scripts i just wanted keira to know that we were totally committed to her doing the part
8799170 ive made films in which the audience is asked to identify with someone who on the surface they might not think that theyre able to whether its a young black boy from hackney or a beautiful 18th century english aristocrat theyre both tragedies theyre both about young people on the verge of adulthood trying to pushing against the social expectations of their time and place
8799171 bigger and messier than weve portrayed it although we dont include it in the film there was a period when bess and georgiana were both pregnant by the duke at the same time
8799172 its like the jerry springer show set in the 18th century though ive always thought there are parallels between jerry springer and the aristocracy all that bad behaviour all those dysfunctional families

8799191 political trials are the continuation of war by other means
8799192 in 300 years of trials of former sovereigns not one has ever been acquitted
8799193 however they did issue a press release via their union the epmu that must of got the bosses worried but its not their fault its labours
8799194 but its not their fault its labours despite the employment relations act being a huge step up from nationals employment contracts act labours law still fails to provide the right to strike over redundancies and outsourcing
8799195 the epmu has consistently refused to advocate for the right to strike it refused in the 1980s it refused in 1991 not for nothing is the epmu known as the union that stopped the general strike and it refuses now
8799196 can you prove this outrageous assertion surely people can strike when they like in a democracy
8799197 theres reason to believe the democrats have been catching up
8799198 i dont know if theyll achieve parity this year but theyll surely be better than they were in 2004
8799199 it sure makes me not judge people as guilty until i hear everything
8799200 its easy to judge people just because they are here
8799201 its very ironic and thats what everybodys kidding me about saying havent you had enough of this place
8799202 people who go to lakewood are screwballs and nuts we try our hardest not to put anybody who goes to lakewood regularly on any jury

8799204 i have a buy on dlf because it is launching its projects in line with plans even after a discount of 15 20 it is worth buying because its affordable housing projects are selling and are not facing delays but i am not considering bidadi knowledge city near bangalore and dankuni township project in kolkata where dlf is dependent on the government for land acquisition
8799205 if it is going for a buyback with no liquidity problems why does it need to raise money also it will need to sell over 35 million sq ft to play the volume game successfully
8799206 we note that the financial gearing has increased for most developers since fy07 and is high for companies such as unitech sobha parsvnath and hdil ebitda interest cover is also low and again the stocks in our coverage that stand out on this metric include unitech sobha parsvnath and ansal stocks that do not rank favourably are dlf parsvnath and sobha
8799207 unitech has not been launching projects there have been very few launches in last 6 9 months and those in the construction phase are delayed parsvnath has huge debts in its books and refinancing loans is a major issue
8799208 interest rates may come down six months down the road but the number of affordable housing projects launched will cause a glut this is a down period where most economies are at a low so indian realty shares being hit is not a surprise
8799209 hdil is running on time with its project and it has already acquired land for its second phase that begins in next three months its commercial development in kurla will add to its revenues

8799231 sure head down to the childrens department aisle 4 blah
8799232 we cant get to it so we will ignore or deny its existence in favor of observable data
8799233 most economic fallacies derive from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie that one party can gain only at the expense of another
8799234 what you have here is the footprints of the hedge funds exiting the commodities markets in a mass stampede nothing more than that
8799235 we remain long gold as we have since august 2001
8799236 within the current rapid speculative trade we are watching for short term price volatility much as occurred at the end of the previous similar period c h1 2006 a 20 correction from 720 to 580 a similar correction today would take gold prices down 200 we are also within the long term for volatility that will portend the end of the currency depreciation and inflation trade that began in 2001
8799237 the estimate represents the worlds largest known populations for both species
8799238 prior to this discovery the largest known populations of the two primate species were believed to live in adjacent vietnam where black shanked doucs and yellow cheeked crested gibbons number at 600 and 200 respectively
8799239 the primates have benefited from a cessation of logging activities a nation wide gun confiscation program implemented in the 1990s and a habitat where there is plenty to eat
8799240 but the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining

8799243 i always tell people im not afraid to take your questions but dont be afraid to hear the answers
8799244 one womans army the commanding general of abu ghraib tells her story
8799245 this is an effort to bring speakers of national stature here to provide their insights to the local community
8799246 were looking forward to the firsthand account and insiders perspective that she can give as to no 1 what is going on in iraq and no 2 what happened at abu ghraib
8799247 when i saw those photographs the world stopped turning for an instant it felt like the walls were caving in on me
8799248 i was in my office it was the 23rd of january 2004
8799249 and two weeks before i had heard of this investigation i heard about it from an mp in the criminal investigation division that this investigation was under way well without being specific without giving me any details he sent me a classified e mail three lines maam i just wanted you to know im going in to brief the commanding general on the progress of the investigation at abu ghraib
8799250 but this wasnt coming from a higher up general or anybody in my chain of command
8799251 this was coming from someone just as a professional courtesy at the time when i read the e mail i was up very close to the iranian border at another location under my control and we were working with a group of iranian dissidents who were being held under protective custody
8799252 what i concluded was there had been some holiday leaves around that time and i thought perhaps a soldier took some pictures of a prisoner behind the wire or in an orange jumpsuit able to identify him took them home and somehow those pictures got into a newspaper or magazine or something in the u s
8799253 i told him i really dont need to see them and that i wouldnt recognize any of the prisoners except
8799254 when i saw those photographs the world stopped turning for an instant it felt like the walls were caving in on me
8799255 i could not it was too much for my mind to absorb you know when i heard about the investigation my mind then thought worst case a picture somehow got to the new york times or something
8799256 so you go from that expectation to seeing that photograph the first photograph of the pyramid style of prisoners i really think i was in shock momentarily i looked at a couple of them and said i dont think i need to see all of them he said you need to look at all of them so you can understand what were facing there were 15 of them in the folder
8799257 i did not know anything about what they were doing in interrogations because interrogations were not my responsibility
8799258 my soldiers were following the orders of the interrogators the commanders of the interrogators or the contractors because those people had full knowledge of the policies and regulations from the highest levels of the administration
8799259 the capital raising of up to approximately 430 million announced today will be used to recapitalise the companys balance sheet providing gunns with a robust balance sheet to support future growth executive chairman john gay said
8799260 absolute need for the reserve bank of australia rba to lower interest rates
8799261 there can be no further delay in respect to a drop in the official cash rate it said today
8799262 the weak result reflects a final bout of mortgage rate increases clashing with sharply higher fuel and food bills
8799263 budgeted sales levels are well down on expectations and that runs the clear risk of the next step being a shedding of labour in the industry mr dale said
8799264 the imminent move to lower interest rates is a welcome first step to a much needed home building recovery but the delay to a tangible boost to construction activity will be significant
8799265 that version of events avoids as it must any hint of the suspension being politically motivated it falls a long way short of traversing this whole episode however it is reasonable to ask how the epmu would have responded to a staff member who had agreed to stand for the labour party but had not told the union of his candidacy certainly there would be no talk of suspension any breach of the collective agreement would be quickly and conveniently overlooked
8799266 mr tans case suggests in fact that any fostering of candidacy is extremely selective indeed the contractual condition requiring permission to stand in elections could be seen as enabling a scrutiny of candidate suitability as much as it allows the union to juggle workloads while a person is campaigning
8799267 earlier this year an employees request to stand for the labour party in local government was turned down

8799271 parents should feel reassured that current events have no effect on the day to day running of our centres he said
8799272 we appreciate the significant role our services play in the lives of all of our families and the provision of a safe educational and fun environment for the children remains our number one priority
8799273 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market said ken hasegawa manager of the energy desk at newedge japan brokerage in tokyo
8799274 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant because of limited capacity
8799275 the environment of sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner he said
8799276 short when their sales exceed holdings in anticipation of selling when prices fall
8799277 the ubiquitous use of debt is a thing of the past he said
8799278 much smaller business after it cuts staff numbers to around 150 by 20010 from 480 at the end of june 30
8799279 when the credit crisis hit we were in transition from a balance sheet investor to a funds manager he said
8799280 in a less than robust shape with a net worth of just 20 million
8799281 fragile and said given agreements struck with its lenders it would be
8799282 we expect to get the current carrying value for the assets as at june 30 and would hope for a bit more mr clarke said
8799283 we need to keep our people otherwise we havent got a value proposition mr clarke said
8799284 strongly independent and managed by its founder john symond who swapped his chief executive role for the chairmans position on august 8 to focus on developing new business instead of operational matters
8799285 zero involvement in the day to day running of the company with the aussie team retaining management control
8799286 ive always owned 100 per cent of the company so this is a first for us he said
8799287 before i was reliant on securitisation which is non existent he said
8799288 if we have access to wholesale funding we can offer our customers a bigger choice in products
8799289 we can grow the business faster than would have otherwise been the case
8799290 cba has always focused on the home loans business and they have the largest home loan share in australia so there is an alignment of objectives
8799291 for customers it will be business as usual but with a bigger product range
8799292 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry mr norris said
8799293 the financial muscle to seize opportunities in this current period of consolidation in the non bank sector
8799294 the difficult conditions in the credit markets have presented aussie with a great opportunity to enhance our leadership position in the non bank sector and continue our position as a consumer champion mr symond said

8799298 we just do not want to allow the type of entertainment that could negatively influence people

8799300 ahora el grupo de las bielas malditas ha dejado de usarse y estamos investigando con controles muy minuciosos todas las piezas que utilizamos

8799302 argentina has the dubious merit of being the first country in the history of the world to try its soldiers who are victorious after the war
8799303 things were pretty good for working class families in detroit until the bush administration
8799304 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8799305 ninety percent of george bush is more than we can take
8799306 i dont believe mccain doesnt care i believe he doesnt know
8799307 they call this the ownership society but what it really means is that youre on your own well its time for them to own their failure
8799308 go out and bloody their nose so you can walk down the street
8799309 we cannot walk alone and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8799310 at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
8799311 theres no change at this stage but that depends on journalists and if they put picket lines in place
8799312 we would expect our people not to cross a picket line
8799313 this protest rally is open to everyone in the community to come out and support high quality journalism at the age and to condemn the low cost low quality journalism that fairfax management wishes to impose
8799314 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action
8799315 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8799316 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8799317 the company has been putting out rumours to that effect for the last couple of weeks we were well aware that thats how they would try and get the papers out if we went on strike
8799318 we would urge people who work for rural press to just continue to do their normal work and to not come in and support fairfax at this time
8799319 but this company puts its employees in a terrible situation and gives them often little choice but to obey its directives its not clear these people are doing it willingly theyve clearly been directed by the company
8799320 its my understanding that mike was unprepared to write during the strike
8799321 this is an indication again that the new regime at fairfax media is embarking on a low quality approach to journalism
8799322 the management is prepared to trample on anyone who gets in their way and the people who will lose out in this case are the sydney morning herald readers
8799323 brutal said further bureau mergers and cuts were being considered
8799324 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8799325 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8799326 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaux of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaux
8799327 you can slim it down to one bureau in canberra covering everything but you end up diminishing the analysis of the democratic process and very seriously so
8799328 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not the part of the business that is being affected at all
8799329 im hearing that theres some very cool stuff that will be shown at the professional developers conference microsofts big developer conference and that unlike when longhorn was shown off that this stuff will actually be based on shipping code ill see you at the professional developer conference in late october
8799330 most of my work these days involves silverlight and i can honestly say its been a long time since ive had this much fun as a developer if you come to l a for the pdc id love to see you at the precon

8799363 people were standing in the crowd with tears in their eyes
8799364 it was not just the ohio delegation but everyone in the hall that responded

8799367 if you have a mobility impairment gravity is your enemy water skiing is a totally different experience
8799368 what theyre looking to do is to get back to where they were
8799369 the way the unnamed cuban officers section worked academics was they would find sympathetic academics and provide them with opportunities to visit cuba and have access to the highest government officials
8799370 in exchange the academics would discuss their meetings with u s government officials in an effort to change u s policy
8799371 thoughtful and rigorous debate might be the ultimate moral act
8799372 that was part of the trouble because there wasnt any concentration in one area
8799373 what is significantly more difficult to get back is the data on the system
8799374 its not the 1950s anymore where you could leave your house unlocked and expect everything to be there
8799375 we have a strong group of returning women and three solid freshmen in saisha galliard sally jerop and agnes kibor
8799376 we will have a lot more depth this season and i have very high expectations for the team
8799377 this year were really excited to have everyone healthy and ready to go this fall
8799378 men have a solid group of returning athletes and add six new athletes this fall
8799379 which gives us a total of 14 runners and a lot more depth than last fall
8799380 our big focus will be on developing stronger front runners and being consistent

8799384 my favorite number is three and the song undo was written for a girl whose favorite number is 26
8799385 since i am a math person 3 26 is like a ratio three to 26 me to her i proposed the idea to the rest of the group and they didnt mind now here we are 3 26
8799386 within the life of the bus it would pay for itself
8799387 our expectations are high for this weekend we went into the spring not knowing what to expect and we surprised ourselves you cant tell we lost five seniors because we gained six awesome freshmen weve been raising the bar since the spring and expect to do well this weekend
8799388 im excited to be playing bowling green we have a young team and this will be great experience for them to start our season off playing such a quality team
8799389 i think all the incoming freshmen and the new players are excited its unknown and all knew to us i think were just relying on our upperclassmen to lead us and if we do get to see the court theyll help us out
8799390 ive watched them play they are a very good team extremely extremely athletic
8799391 hes very good very athletic and does a great job of controlling the game from the back
8799392 well have a body on him more often than not and well need to find a way to keep him from controlling the tempo

8799396 maintaining the underlying value of the business has been a major focus of the management team mr rufran said
8799397 the headline loss of 2055 million does not reflect the operating performance of the group for the past financial year
8799398 after adding back the above items to the headline result the underlying earnings are 242 million
8799399 our tenants are heavily weighted toward necessity orientated retailers such as supermarkets and discount stores and it is these retailers that continue to perform solidly when economic conditions start to slow mr rufrano said

8799587 so they didnt always look consistent with their pass and that takes your middle out of the game that was our goal because we know how good of a player she is
8799588 we made too many errors and we didnt really work as a team
8799589 were still working on that and will come out next game with a better mentality they were chipping over alex tanner and they were just killing us there
8799590 finally we moved our defense more and it started getting better but they obviously werent hitting toward me and focusing on hitting down the line more there was no way we could have stopped it because alex isnt the tallest person in the world
8799591 nikki is a great player for them so we tried to mix it up against them and running different things while trying to take different shots and we did that tonight going against them was nerve wracking but we got this win under our belt we know now we can close out in three against really good teams
8799592 if we could play 500 on the road id accept that
8799593 they battle and fight and scratch every night plus its a good group of guys
8799594 the numbers dont lie hes been streaky at times and still needs to work on his two strike approach and not strike out so much but the ball certainly jumps off his bat and he carried this ballclub for two solid weeks at one point
8799595 as soon as we secured her and knew she was coming we knew we had a strong player right off the bat
8799596 she knew what she wanted out of her defense she knows how to orchestrate shes loud in the back and more than that shes helping our younger goalies get their footwork down for when she leaves shes doing multiple roles and we couldnt be prouder to have her here
8799597 she keeps us in control and keeps us very calm before the game she was like ive done this many times its just another game stay calm she keeps us balanced and keeps us informed shes definitely a star captain
8799598 neither offense was moving the ball very well at that point and it gave us momentum going into the half
8799599 i owe everything to my teammates and especially my linemen
8799600 we just tried to keep the same amount of intensity for the entire game and we got a big win
8799601 we were dominated in every possible way we couldve been tonight
8799602 we have athletes on this team but they have to learn to play the game better and we didnt play to our capability tonight
8799603 the reason we kept pooch kicking it was because we were scared of burton returning the ball for a big gain which he did the first time
8799604 estamos tranquilos para enfrentarnos a chivas pero con optimismo a pesar de no haber ganado ayer un descuido nos cost el partido pero a n as el equipo est tranquilo para el siguiente encuentro
8799605 tenemos jugadas que necesitamos reafirmar falta tranquilidad al definir necesitamos calma para tomar la decisi n correcta calma para decidir
8799606 de los seis partidos hay que corregir un mont n de cosas pero hemos ido ganando en cuatro as que es muy raro tener s lo un partido ganado a veces el futbol es as estamos en un momento que no es bueno pero todav a lo podemos sacar adelante no lo veo como algo cr tico
8799607 est en una situaci n l mite donde tiene que empezar a ganar somos conscientes de eso lo vamos a lograr tengo mucha fe estoy muy ilusionado con este equipo
8799608 lo que s fue desconcentraci n es donde nosotros hab amos recalcado en su momento el otro d a contra jaguares y el partido con toluca que a los diez minutos perd amos ya lo hab amos modificado pero ayer no me pareci fue un partido muy parejo
8799609 jugar bien soy siempre partidario de ese estilo de juego y de un estilo que debe tener am rica eso s agresivo ya no tenemos tanto margen pero s debe haber alguna idea futbol stica
8799610 para nada de hecho la presi n est perfecta van seis fechas por ah dentro de una fecha cambia todo y las preguntas vuelven a cambiar ganas tres partidos seguidos y te pones arriba si bien las cr ticas son constructivas nosotros nos damos cuenta de lo que hacemos mal
8799611 i know i gave her the last can last night

8799696 they seem to be selling it on the fact that its available in a variety of colours pink black and white but it actually has pretty decent specs as well its equipped with wlan 802 11 and ethernet for quick connections and has an 80gb hard drive which isnt bad for such a small computer when you compare this with its 10 inch screen and full size keyboard to the recently launched fizzbook its a clear winner but then they are different markets but what makes lg think they can contend with the big boys of umpc world since the race is still going strong no one has established a winner yet and though the eee pc may lead the way for budget models the business user would like something with a little more memory advents a contender at the moment as is lenovo but lg could pip them to the post with user friendly tariffs and an attractive amount of monthly downloads its not impossible especially as theyve teamed up with phones 4 u to stock the netbooks in pink and white so you can hopefully expect market friendly monthly priceplans the netbook has an integrated gps receiver and weighs in at 1 19kg which is 2 7g heavier than the eee pc and 0 5g heavier than the advent hmm thats not a good start is it we have no info on prices as yet but that will make all the difference methinks ill keep you posted

8799700 dudosa legitimidad de los ltimos prelados del obispado priorato de san marcos de le n del que era entonces gobernador maesso tambi n hemos de hacer constar que en el mismo peri dico y por alguien que firma como nota de un ignorante se nos informa que esa retractaci n del acusador doncel est hecha por temor al destierro y otras penalidades y que le fueron dictadas materialmente qu hab amos de esperar de un siglo donde se desfoga toda la intolerancia educada de antes que se desangra en guerras civiles dicen por los derechos de un trono que es primer culpable de toda esa destrucci n parece que esa lucha se traslad a otros rdenes de la vida social religiosa y privada la revancha y el resentimiento intolerable son patrimonio exclusivo espa ol hoy y ayer sea como fuere el hecho es que por cuesti n un poco latosa de pormenorizar se acord por parte del papa de roma abolir los territorios eclesi sticos administrados por las rdenes militares y que sus parroquias se distribuyeran entre los obispados m s pr ximos pero resulta que el gobernador maesso hombre apasionado donde los haya se opone tozudamente frente a roma y madrid que por su ineptitud han permitido el desaguisado y con l una parte del clero y casi todo el pueblo y no s lo en llerena sino en m rida azuaga alange etc la autoridad civil apoya a maesso estamos en plena euforia revolucionaria y republicana en nuestro siglo xix los denigradores del cisma llegan a decir que maesso impetra auxilio del alcalde popular de llerena y que desde madrid env an un cl rigo liberal que levanta a las masas y al pueblo que ya era hora decimos aunque fuese para desperezarse en fin que maesso es declarado incluso en pena de excomuni n por negarse a entregar sellos libros y objetos existentes en su gobierno eclesi stico y neg ndose a la entrega y reconocimiento del obispo de badajoz como prelado y su insistencia en seguir ejerciendo sus funciones dur el cisma protegido por los municipios y los jueces de primera instancia no olvidar que maesso era doctor en jurisprudencia y por la situaci n pol tica reinante desde mediados de 1873 hasta el a o 1875 poco despu s del golpe del general pav a y de instaurarse la monarqu a del bisabuelo de juan carlos i el clero cism tico pues declararse en cisma no es otra cosa que la negaci n de la obediencia debida al romano pont fice en materia de disciplina no de doctrina se retract por lo que respecta al pueblo de llerena y de azuaga y de m rida es indudable que si apoy el cisma no lo har a pensando en aspectos religiosos ni jur dicos y menos nacionalistas de esta cuesti n aunque algo habr a en aquella euforia de una rep blica federal y cantonalista donde el pueblo dio rienda suelta a su hartera de uniformismo y unidad desde madrid pero tambi n lo hizo considerando que la importancia de su ciudad ya muy mermada se vendr a abajo al quedar incorporada a la di cesis de badajoz y perder la capitalidad jurisdiccional despu s de siglos que pose a indudablemente fue a peor hasta casi el olvido merced a esta puntillada de roma y madrid una de las muchas que se han cernido sobre el toro contra la barrera y moribundo bravo de extremadura respecto al jefe del cisma el gobernador maesso hab a que decir que su actitud fue de verdadera obcecaci n frente a una partida jugada con roma y madrid que estaba perdida de antemano hoy como ayer desmesurada pasi n por el priorato en el que hab a nacido y que hab a servido toda su vida sacerdotal su rebeld a est as explicada aunque no justificada dice alg n tendencioso erudito fiel al pueblo pues para hacer frente a poderosos enemigos que cuentan con legiones de mercenarios del terror espiritual y del otro se necesita entereza y no mera defensa de intereses personales para enjuiciar su figura se precisa estudio m s a fondo de su biograf a que se har y quiz s acometa yo mismo un d a otro gallo cantara si el tal maesso hubiese nacido en la corte y no en lo que se considera el trasero del mundo figuras as lo merecen y no los que apuestan siempre por caballos ganadores y con malas artes estos escritos mitad diario y mitad reflexi n sobre cosas de la vida y de la historia de su situaci n y de su mbito me fueron entregados por alguien que ya no vive al hacerlo me pidi silencio sobre ellos pero pasado el tiempo creo no faltar a la memoria del muerto ni a ninguna otra si los publico nunca le pregunt a esa persona que me los entreg d nde y c mo los hall llev ndose el secreto a la tumba puede que el d a del juicio los curiosos en saberlo satisfagan su inter s de sabidur a al tener la oportunidad mientras hacen cola ante el tribunal divino por esas razones que se nos escapan sus estudiosos acuerdan que maesso se retract hizo ejercicios espirituales y muri santamente desde luego para 1888 a n parece que no lo hab a hecho pertinaz en su cisma y solo como los vindicadores de las grandes causas siempre perdidas para mal de la humanidad de destacar la enorme cultura de nuestro cism tico que no todos los pueblos lo tienen y su alucinante relaci n epistolar con julio verne que a la saz n contaba con sesenta a os y del que este a o se celebra el 160 aniversario del nacimiento textos de maesso si para mejor dominar a un pa s a un pueblo lo indicado es destruirlo seg n lo dijo el malvado el sapo de maquiavelo esta terrible m xima en su justo cumplimiento ser a darlo sentirla a mi generaci n nuestra generaci n y en mi propia carne 1 y es por ello por lo que quiero dejar en estos escritos que posteriormente confiar a t 2 mi escrupuloso testimonio porque en otros lugares m s afortunados que el nuestro los escritores de cada periodo dejaron abierto y abonado el camino para la historia pero ha sido tal la clase de tiran a que nuestros escritores han padecido durante siglos sometidos a las acechanzas del poder real y de la no menos maligna inquisici n 3 que ha impedido no s lo que aparecieran relaciones escritas por autores testigos de los acontecimientos cuyas revelaciones y sana cr tica sirvieran de correctivo al servilismo y adulaci n a los llamados cronistas e historiadores sino que ha hecho posible que esos mercenarios de la pluma a sueldo mintieran descaradamente y sin ninguna clase de miramientos a la posteridad total ellos ya no iban a estar siempre se ha sabido que toda autobiograf a encierra una justificaci n de uno mismo y yo no intentar eludir esos elogios o aquellos ataques que fueron en la m a aunque naden en favor de la corriente y afrontar las cosas tal y como fueron y no tal y como debieron haber sido soy hombre del siglo xix y milito en las filas del liberalismo en su m s amplio concepto he practicado pues un amor candoroso e ingenuo por el progreso porque hubo una proterva prole de espa oles que en esta centuria ha participado de un entusiasmo sin l mites en el porvenir del g nero humano he sufrido el drama de ser un liberal en una tierra como la nuestra por ser rara avis y mi esp ritu de rancio intelectual me arrastr hoy precisamente a un mes de un hecho ben volo para el g nero humano 4 salgo a pasear en la siesta cuando todo en pleno d a se aletarga camino cabizbajo por tortuosas y arm nicas calles hacia el templo mayor de la ciudad llerena es ciudad pajarera quiero decir que en sus cielos vuelan las m s varias especies de aves alegrando la vista y los sentidos es algo que conmueve y es cotidiano el continuo canto de p jaros en la primavera en todo el mbito de la poblaci n nosotros sus habitantes al estar acostumbrados a esa polisonora m sica de pajarer a lo consideramos normal y no lo echamos en cuenta es espect culo especialmente grandioso en el est o el amanecer en el cielo de llerena cientos de vuelos de cientos de vencejos y otros pajarillos lo sobrevuelan en un misterioso silencio pujante mientras la luz del nuevo d a va tomando posesi n de su mbito y espacios tengo grabada mi visi n de este hecho desde la plazuela del teatro 5 el motivo de dirigirme por calles serpentinas a la granada es por mi deseo de no encontrar a nadie a esta hora reflexiva mientras la noble leal y antigua grey ciudadana duerme la siesta aunque ser a raro ver ahora a alg n ind gena ya que se hayan en ese resuello mortal del pueblo castizo y espa ol ciudad con historia y hambre o sea dos veces desgraciada como dir el sabio y heme aqu en esta dura situaci n mezquina postrada y en esta edad avanzada as me condenan los poderes de madrid y roma a mayor cacumen mayor desamparo y la inteligencia s lo granjea desdichas all donde surja un genio se le conoce porque todos los necios se conjuran contra l en esas desgracias y en ese desamparo es donde se nos da la sabidur a salom nica no como don sino como conquista dura y bien pagada insobornable intransferible y poco til ya echo a volar la imaginaci n y transciendo todo en ese vuelo como esas palomas de la torre en este claro d a y luminoso de verano y a esta alta hora de sol en situaci n de vuelo de libertad cavilante y con esa sapiencia del dolor y del fracaso veo claras las mentes los animales y las cosas el mundo por concretar simb licamente pienso en madrid y roma s el estado y la iglesia el papa y el rey el papado y la monarqu a han sido mis verdugos y cuando uno los tiene enfrente aunados est perdido bueno se me ocurre pensar anhelando que si lo chinos invadieran esto que llaman europa no volver a a pasar m s este peligro amarillo se

opresi n de autoridad de palo y tentetieso de las razones de estado que son los cr menes m s horrendos contra la humanidad y su dignidad y todo para que emergiera ese monstruo que hoy corroe nuestra vida y nuestros h gados eso que llaman estado y sus criminales razones de existencia por encima de todas las razones y de lo humano impuesto y pisoteando igualdades fraternidades y libertades que tan caras me son 7 sus sinrazones hunden sus torvas ra ces en estos te ricos del humanismo renacentista en fin tanta estupidez humana en estos tiempos parece imposible e incluso lo que pienso me parece un mal sue o una pesadilla en aquella capilla del prior en esa hora de siesta y en aquel fresco de azulejos del pisano donde un caballero santiaguista como yo ondea y blande su espada sanguinolenta montado en blanco caballo mientras esparcidas cabezas separadas de cuerpos de enemigos infieles yacen por las suelos he ah la barbarie s pero m s redenta que la del estado de los ca ticos reyes que subyugaron todo a sus fines su monarqu a tan una y su estado as roma como siempre va perdida desde el edicto de mil n en el a o 313 permiti que los poderes que persegu an y mataban se cristianizaran que secuestraran lo cristiano esa roma papal que se transform en imitativa del odioso imperio romano verdugo de los seguidores de cristo empe ados en derribar aquel imperio por la fuerza de la fe vieron pasmados como esa fe levantaba otro imperio el imperio que hoy me condena a m y me excomulga y ese imperio de roma apoya y otorga poder a isabel y fernando para usurpar el maestrazgo en el siglo xv y desde entonces atan corto los bienes santiaguistas y hacen y deshacen con la m s impune de las injusticias y luego todos los reyes posteriores hasta esta edad m a en que se colma el vaso y soy precipitado a lo hondo de un precipicio donde los poderes arrojan a quien les reta hasta cu ndo heme aqu soy su ltima v ctima herida de muerte por otra isabel a la que aconsejan los m s peligrosos meapilas del cristianismo oficial y estatista de roma que todo hay que diferenciarlo por eso cada d a me reafirmo m s en las catacumbas en esta comunidad de creyentes y constructores 8 que es como la vida de los primeros cristianos un grupo de gentes iluminadas que se presenta con ideas totalmente revolucionarias y cr ticas en una roma acosada tal esta poca por la destrucci n moral y f sica nadie se ha preocupado por indagar y reconstruir esta vida de los primeros cristianos imagino que es consecuencia de la tremenda politizaci n en la que vivieron los pioneros del catolicismo unos hombres empe ados en construir una casa com n libre fraterna igual recuerdo a la edad en que yo ten a catorce a os y hall ndome en la poblaci n de berlanga distante pocas leguas de estos cielos que me ven como vi a un hombre admirado por m el general rafael del riego asesinado en la plaza de la cebada de madrid por la ignorancia del pueblo espa ol y la soberbia est pida de los borbones tengo en la memoria a ese m rtir y combatir siempre y en todo lugar a sus tres asesinos la ignorancia el fanatismo y la tiran a en berlanga proclam la constituci n de 1812 en la que tanto trabajaron inteligentes extreme os para dotar al pueblo espa ol de un instrumento de gobierno democr tico para m fue emocionante el discurso de aquel hombre lleno de sudor y polvo desde un balc n del concejo municipal berlangue o 9 era tanto su nfasis en predicar la libertad y la dignidad de los hombres que para m fue mi nacimiento a una nueva vida tambi n recuerdo que algunos soldados de su columna y entre el griter o lanzaban vivas a la rep blica cosa que no dej de interesarme hasta enterarme de qu significaba aquello al releer todos estos papeles de mis recuerdos no dejo de tener una profunda sensaci n de amargura y sentir que estoy dando voces en el desierto y a sordos en mi oscura voz provinciana dedico el tiempo que me permiten mis achaques en escribir estas reflexiones que acabar n perdi ndose de la memoria de los hombres son mis ocios y digo ocios porque he aprendido que en este pa s se considera que el escritor es un ocioso que a las maneras de perder el tiempo usuales en los vagos naturales a ade la de escribir c mo recuerdo a ese pobre diablo que en otra poca m s feliz fue amigo m o a don eutimio de torres autor de ese ingente y voluminoso trabajo titulado la autopsia de don quijote despu s de extra as y largas peripecias termin loco o lo terminaron que es m s verdad y todo comenz con dejar su trabajo en la diputaci n donde trabajaba y ponerse a buscar unos papeles de lo que l llam la autopsia original de don quijote as recorri gran parte de la pen nsula hispana y parte del sur de francia gastando una enorme fortuna propia y del mecenazgo del presidente de la diputaci n en que era mero chupatintas y todo para redactar un tratado doctoral sobre sus indagaciones de tan peregrino tema ser a de inter s general que recogiera alg n d a toda la aventura del proceso pero ahora no me hallo con nimos y nadie como yo posee datos y cartas largas informes tremendos luengos y de mucho inter s en donde don eutimio me narra de pintoresca manera sus haza as en pos de las fuentes de su trabajo e investigaci n en la busca de los documentos de la autopsia de don quijote ah est n para que alg n d a las hile y les d coherencia narrativa precisa pero tambi n me encuentro

8799747 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
8799748 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
8799749 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
8799750 we are a team that is very young and new to the big scene
8799751 41 points is a lot better than 14 im sure of that an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
8799752 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run

8799765 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8799766 i guess by tomorrow they will have their act a little more in order
8799767 we measure progress by how many people get jobs that can pay the mortgage
8799768 we love this country to much to make the next for years look like the last eight
8799769 we cannot make the 21st century work with a 20th century bureaucracy
8799770 this election has never been about me it is about you
8799771 when you think about all of the historical things that are coming together to make this moment its almost eerie but yet exciting and prophetic
8799772 i believe that this will rekindle re inspire the american dream that you can
8799773 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8799774 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8799775 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8799776 the issues that people supported hillary on they could not possibly vote for mccain
8799777 barack obama has a singular opportunity to make the case no surrogate can do that because obama is not well enough known including by my people in toledo
8799778 to hear him say that drilling would be a stop gap and not a long term solution was very important to me
8799779 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change we need
8799780 the corporate media i feel has made an inaccurate portrayal of how the party is divided and how no one knows who obama is but anyone who is watching this program will see how he really is
8799781 ive been to every convention since 1964 and ive never seen the kind of interest of average americans in politics as i see tonight
8799782 i worry that this is a mosh pit and not a political gathering
8799783 but my kids understand that this is how you communicate in the 21st century
8799784 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but were the one who will pay for his flip flops
8799785 i want to know how is he going to make all of this come together
8799786 tell the people who you are and what youre going to do and bash john mccain a little bit
8799787 closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8799788 if he had attacked that side of it it would have made it tougher for republicans to say hes just another tax and spend democrat
8799789 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8799790 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8799791 im not sure i have any tears left maybe with the election of barack obama we can create a truly multiracial democracy
8799792 its the realization of a dream for a whole race of people
8799793 those of us whove held public office never thought theyd see this
8799794 whats important is what we do tomorrow in organizing 200 000 precincts across the nation
8799795 the grassroots army is your best defense whats important now is in the streets
8799796 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8799797 wants to impose wide ranging even draconian restrictions on former diplomats to prevent them from discussing anything that draws on their experience in the diplomatic service
8799798 freedom of information means it is not up to the government to decide what information is made public and what stays private
8799799 us promises consequences for russian actions in georgia voice of america
8799800 i think that was a very good sign that this was not going to be a top down kind of campaign it was going to be a bottom up structure and i think thats working very well
8799801 there are reports that im on my way to dayton tonight not true wasnt invited to be there and any reports that im going to be there are a big surprise to me
8799802 i have never been contacted by the mccain campaign at any point about the vp slot
8799803 i think that was a very good sign that this was not going to be a top down kind of campaign it was going to be a bottom up structure and i think thats working very well
8799804 out of our first unit i thought we tackled better
8799805 still not as well as we need to but better than we have in the past we had some assignment errors but they did it full speed
8799806 i thought one thing that did shine was our tackle
8799807 i thought jerry franklin had an exceptional day at tackle
8799808 elton ford is going to be a wonderful football player
8799809 we are going to have growing pains with him but he sees things breaks well and hes starting to play the game pretty good so hes another guy that stood out that day
8799810 our experience is up front with our older players but we have all new starters at our secondary positions and inexperience at the linebacker position thats kind of scary going into the first game so you have to be not so much scared but aware of what your opponent can bring to the table western illinois is a fine football team were playing on saturday
8799811 according to all the newspaper clippings hes one of the top five at his position
8799812 that says enough in itself but when you watch him on film we sit down there and breakdown plays by personnel and this basic personnel group we call regular you basically recruit that kid or draft that kid off that one clip the guy is an outstanding football player
8799813 the way that its been concluded i believe everybodys views have been able to be taken into account cr cunningham said
8799814 your young people deserve quality recreation facilities as do people of my vintage and older cr cunningham said
8799815 council has shown a commitment to develop both sites with an equal amount of energy and its important if were going to gain funding through state and federal budgets that this process commences
8799816 the existing indoor facilities some of them are on their last legs already and we really needed to get moving on this quickly so that we have continuity of the facilities being available to the people living in the municipality cr marshall said
8799817 we are now in the position to be able to go ahead and develop plans to make the alexandra oval reserve our premier outdoor sports complex area and i think thats great
8799818 i was a bit concerned that we were making a decision like this when i represent council on the alexandra oval user group and they were so concerned about what was happening and they were so dead against it cr allgood said
8799819 its important we have contact there so input can be brought back to council cr allgood said
8799820 while we dont know yet what such a facility might look like we feel alexandra oval and kokoda park could really complement one another and there may be ways we could link the two to create one central health and recreational precinct ms frampton said
8799821 over the last few months weve been communicating with staff that there was a real chance of things slowing down and it was confirmed on friday mr carthew said
8799822 everyone knew it was happening last friday and they knew it would be effective by the end of this week
8799823 its our wish they go from employment with us to be fully supported where possible mr carthew said
8799824 we want to soften the blow as much as we can
8799825 were certainly not out of business weve got lots of opportunities and it wont be too long im certain before well be employing again but having said that were not sure how long it will last mr carthew said
8799826 its terrible weve been affected by this national slowdown but we also have to be thankful that our customer base is still strong and were still a strong team of 240 plus people

8799841 re rhios phrs are the goals so different between the rhios and phr vendors that they will stay separate or do you envision a time that they will merge from a data collection perspective are they not collecting mostly the same information from to providers and payers but only organizing and distributing it for different audiences and users

8799843 re epic you buy the idea that judy does not own a controlling interest in the company and you are smoking what
8799844 re histalk search did you change the search engine on the back end from google and on a different note regarding the guy who is so busy he wants you to write less i bet i am as busy as he is and i want you to write more actually the size of the blog as it is today is just perfect and dont let any annular muscle tell you otherwise
8799845 re misys allscripts i have friends working at both of these companies each camp seems to believe their products will survive the merger and the sunset products will come from the other company meanwhile salespeople are being told to expect some territory changes as the two sales teams are merged glad i dont work at either company right now
8799846 the company also has strongly hinted that local layoffs should be expected with misys ceo mike lawrie telling analysts the day the deal was announced that they could let your imagination run wild about potential synergies in the triangle
8799847 re perot and medsphere histalk just recorded its 1 5 millionth hit besides the snarky commentary histalk and the lovely new addition of hertalk has continued to gain readership with its deadpan commentary that is always dead on as the readership has grown the quality of the tips and the accuracy of the insight has also increased i believe nearly everyone with a need to know turns to histalk when they need to know
8799848 re icd10 effect i think icd10 will be very hard on the older vendors i would hope that most of the newer vendors planned for it we did as we knew it would come eventually i think it will cause a squeeze on vendors more than anything as it will have a significant cost associated with it i do not think it will really hurt emr sales though as i think the vendors will just have to suck it up and do it i do think that it might push some clients into asking their hospital to help via stark in that way i think it might help drive emr sales

8799865 were generally happy with what weve been getting out of it and weve learned a tremendous amount
8799866 regardless of what happens to it were going to get this thing well written up and documented
8799867 bob bussard was a truly innovative person thats abundantly clear
8799868 i hope he will be remembered for that i think that will be the case
8799869 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8799870 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8799871 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8799872 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8799873 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8799874 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8799875 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8799876 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8799877 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8799878 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8799879 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8799880 i dont think there can ever be a season like last year
8799881 everyone is excited about hitting someone banging someone elses pads other than your team its about time to play a game
8799882 this is a great place to get started on my next goal my next dream of trying to get more people involved in the sport of swimming but also more people involved in exercising
8799883 i hope im literally not a fish out of water in that one
8799884 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
8799885 i think i performed well but i could have done better
8799886 its a lot of pressure filling ryan nunns shoes but i am just going to go out and do the best that i can
8799887 its certainly not the way we planned for it to happen without a doubt
8799888 the thing thats really painful to me and our staff is you want to give people a reason to believe you want to keep them around and excited and we didnt do that tonight
8799889 i felt like i let a lot of people down
8799890 i thought he played hard i thought he provided a spark which is what he has to do for us
8799891 but i would like to say he played hard and provided a spark and we won the game
8799892 this is his third year to start hes a veteran and took what we gave him
8799893 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8799894 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8799895 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8799896 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8799897 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8799898 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today
8799899 were not in an ideal situation but were not an ideal team right now
8799900 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week
8799901 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8799902 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8799903 it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be payton said
8799904 after all weve been through we can handle whatevers thrown our way
8799905 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated
8799906 i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8799907 immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8799908 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8799909 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8799910 obviously the last two games ive thrown the ball pretty good ive changed the pace of the ball thrown it over the plate kept them off balance
8799911 today he did the same thing he did the last time out he attacked the strike zone with his fastball he went to his off speed stuff when he needed to he was really good and thats the kind of guy i like to see
8799912 all i can do is play hard every day and try to improve at everything the astros organization hasnt given any of us much of an indication on who might go up so all you can do is play as hard as you can
8799913 hes been one of our most consistent guys and plays the right way
8799914 we went into the season thinking we were going to beat everybody and we were rudely disappointed
8799915 they dont know that the battles theyre going to face will be extremely tough
8799916 to work in an area as pretty as this is worth the challenge
8799917 coach is always positive and he wants us to work as hard as we can every day
8799918 were probably going to be the underdog in every game we play
8799919 theyll be thinking oh this is canyon lake theyll look at it as an easy victory
8799920 im as fired up about this game as anything in my whole life
8799921 you want to play like youre a little kid again
8799922 always work like youre no 2 on the depth chart
8799923 we scored 30 points tonight but we can do so much better than this

8799933 the fact that this guy is going to jail for walking dogs i think it highlights the lack of proportionality of this prosecution this case
8799934 it shouldnt be a criminal case this isnt someone who did anything purposely to any animal or person
8799935 i think what happened is theres a couple dogs that are still up there and theyre his dogs
8799936 i think hes put in the tough position he had the option of neglecting them or making sure those two dogs that were left were cared for
8799937 despite animal services and sheriffs offices numerous attempts they have been unable to locate him

8799949 para la doctrina cristiana no hay nada m s sagrado que la naturaleza como parte del encuentro del ser humano para desarrollar el mundo y en las ense anzas te ricas no hay nada m s ecologista que la visi n cristiana de la vida
8799950 cuando se necesit una voz fuerte para se alar que estamos en una sociedad materialista y burguesa fue monse or alejandro goic como representante de la conferencia episcopal el que habl del sueldo tico y ahora que el ansia de dinero en nuestro pa s est arrasando con la naturaleza son ellos los que salen con fuerza moral a defender lo que es la esencia de nuestros recursos naturales
8799951 no puede quedar en una carta pastoral hay que llevarlo a acciones pol ticas y p blicas
8799952 sobre todo porque tenemos historia en la constitucionalidad medioambiental pero vemos c mo nuestro partido se ha ido alejando de ello
8799953 el tema medioambiental simplemente no est en la agenda de la directiva de la dc ni ha habido espacio de conversaci n de los problemas relacionados con esto que aquejan a chile pero esto es extensivo a toda la concertaci n que en general est al servicio de la econom a y no de las personas

8799956 if anything happens to mrs carr i will sue your collective arses off
8799957 yesterday the psychological abuse reached a new and very dangerous level after about 30 mins the consultant said that he had all that he needed mrs carr asked what he had found and he said
8799958 psychotherapeutic relationships are damaging to you and should be avoided
8799959 there are some for whom it is harmful you should consider this
8799960 are you saying that i should be denied the basic human need of relationships
8799961 are you saying that it is not a basic human need to have relationships
8799962 now i know exactly what you mean there is no more to say
8799963 the two nhs responses to our msps letter require a degree in
8799964 the important issue of mrs carrs suicide attempt and continuing self harm are mentioned only in the last paragraph of a 5 page letter and then only obliquely
8799965 we didnt intend to dismiss mrs carrs suicide attempt but rather we responded to the points you raised in the context of the information provided by the clinical team
8799966 i must admit this is a classic of its type what the nhs replier is really saying is
8799967 if we accept that the replier was not given any information about the suicide the replier could and should have gone back to the clinicians and insisted that they give appropriate information of course this didnt happen because they did not want to answer the question this gets even better having explained in the second letter why there was no information in the first letter about mrs carrs suicide etc the replier still did not answer the question in the second letter i hope you followed that therefore despite having been asked twice the nhs in two letters avoided saying anything about mrs carrs suicide attempt and on going risk of self harm although they explain if you believe it why they didnt answer in letter 1 there really should be an award for writing in such an apparently clear and reasonable way but actually in a very obstructive manner
8799968 dont smile too soon since i posted about the mental welfare commission of scotlands investigation into mr g 1

8799972 what is the total amount of overcharges im not certain the audit came up with an answer
8799973 even if the contract carried out the letter of the law
8799974 it is obvious it did not carry out the spirit

8799987 you totally disregard the writings of what the church received from the apostles plus you disregard other writings that might help augment what the bible is saying you dont know what was taught and you deny that anybody else can instead you want us to rely on that silly woman dee dee who just writes whatever pops into her imagination that will possibly support a doctrine that has little real basis in fact
