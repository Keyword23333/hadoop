8540000 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8540001 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8540002 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8540003 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8540004 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8540005 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8540006 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8540007 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8540008 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8540009 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8540010 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8540011 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8540012 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8540013 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8540014 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8540015 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8540016 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8540017 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8540018 weve taken a unit of work and linked it all together
8540019 our aim is to make it make fun engaging and educational
8540020 my favourite experiment was the hovercraft where you use a balloon with a cd and they spin
8540021 our class has actually been doing science for some time
8540022 you have to sticky tape metal to metal and then the lights comes on like this
8540023 it really lets the kids construct their own understanding and age is no barrier to what they can do
8540024 its kids teaching kids and how to learn in kids language
8540025 hong kong and macao are a door into china two cities where there is a strong european and asian culture a great variety of establishments and 30 million tourists a year
8540026 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8540027 release with me all that is locked inside as we become one
8540028 once completed this new facility will be able to accommodate approximately 4 000 new employees
8540029 dear fans in columbus i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8540030 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8540031 vinstrikt bolag med 75 till 200 miljoner i vinst per r
8540032 plea for a politics of consensus serving as a warning against single issue political movements or against the separation of america into racial ethnic or gender based constituencies
8540033 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8540034 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8540035 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8540036 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8540037 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8540038 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8540039 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8540040 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8540041 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8540042 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8540043 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8540044 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8540045 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8540046 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8540047 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8540048 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8540049 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8540050 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8540051 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8540052 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8540053 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8540054 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8540055 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8540056 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8540057 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8540058 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8540059 the next six months are going to tell the story
8540060 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8540061 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8540062 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8540063 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8540064 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8540065 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8540066 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8540067 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8540068 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8540069 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8540070 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8540071 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8540072 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8540073 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8540074 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8540075 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8540076 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8540077 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8540078 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8540079 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8540080 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8540081 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8540082 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8540083 if the democrats dont get over this they will never look themselves in the mirror and say oh me oh my why isnt our party landsliding the worst republicans in the history of the nader is in denver this week for the
8540084 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8540085 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8540086 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8540087 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8540088 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8540089 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8540090 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8540091 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8540092 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8540093 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8540094 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8540095 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8540096 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8540097 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8540098 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8540099 i wish i had know this before we had three
8540100 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8540101 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8540102 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8540103 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8540104 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8540105 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8540106 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8540107 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8540108 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8540109 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8540110 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8540111 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8540112 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8540113 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8540114 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent
8540115 right now we are holding a majority by the skin of joe liebermans teeth
8540116 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8540117 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8540118 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8540119 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8540120 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8540121 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8540122 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8540123 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8540124 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8540125 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8540126 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8540127 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8540128 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8540129 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8540130 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8540131 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8540132 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8540133 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8540134 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8540135 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8540136 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8540137 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8540138 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8540139 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8540140 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8540141 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8540142 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8540143 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8540144 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8540145 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8540146 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8540147 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8540148 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8540149 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8540150 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8540151 that should not take away from their great qualities as pioneers and doers
8540152 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
8540153 pickens is reaching that part of deep america thats usually not touched by the traditional environmental discourse
8540154 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8540155 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8540156 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8540157 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8540158 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8540159 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8540160 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8540161 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8540162 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8540163 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8540164 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8540165 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8540166 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8540167 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8540168 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8540169 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8540170 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8540171 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8540172 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8540173 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8540174 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8540175 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8540176 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8540177 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8540178 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8540179 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8540180 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8540181 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8540182 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8540183 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8540184 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8540185 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8540186 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8540187 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8540188 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8540189 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8540190 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8540191 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8540192 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8540193 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8540194 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8540195 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8540196 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8540197 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8540198 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8540199 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8540200 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8540201 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8540202 o est dio ol mpico de pequim em 360 graus
8540203 though tension prevails the situation has been brought under control in 6 7 out of the 12 blocks of the district
8540204 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8540205 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8540206 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8540207 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8540208 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8540209 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8540210 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8540211 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8540212 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8540213 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8540214 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8540215 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8540216 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8540217 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8540218 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8540219 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8540220 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8540221 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8540222 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government

8540225 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8540226 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8540227 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8540228 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8540229 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8540230 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8540231 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8540232 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8540233 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding

8540236 we are the veterans the iraq war veterans the anti war veterans
8540237 i was part of vietnam and that was a hoax this iraq expletive is even worse
8540238 the promise at the beginning of all of this was we stay peaceful they stay peaceful
8540239 through the indications of a lot of things we felt the protesters were getting ready to move down start creating destruction of private property and possibly assaulting people
8540240 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8540241 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8540242 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8540243 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8540244 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8540245 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8540246 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8540247 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads

8540259 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8540260 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8540261 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8540262 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8540263 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her

8540268 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8540269 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8540270 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8540271 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8540272 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8540273 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8540274 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908

8540286 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8540287 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8540288 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8540289 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8540290 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8540291 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8540326 the entire industry has been badly hit by one bad news after the other with the msp revised maize will not be available for less than rs 1 000 a quintal in the open market since maize is the main ingredient for poultry feed the production cost will go up it will thus have an impact on the egg prices
8540327 the production cost for the poultry industry will rise by at least 20 per cent as half of the feed contains maize this will affect the prices of eggs and chicken

8540360 its the first ive ever heard of a polygraph being used like that
8540361 but sentencing is pretty much a subjective thing to me its sort of the same kind of thing as if you admit your guilt and say youre sorry ill consider the apology in lowering your sentence
8540362 oh my goodness oh my goodness i cant believe this is happening i cant believe he is doing this
8540363 i am being held with no bail for a charge that i did not commit
8540364 i tryed sic to explain it was not me since 3 13 06 an sic you believed me some way thats why you ask for a polygraph test or evidence stating that it was not me who perpetrated the alleged crime
8540365 the appellate courts say it cant come in as evidence as proof of guilt or innocence and i certainly agree that the state shouldnt be able to say he failed a polygraph so you should find him guilty on that basis
8540366 they use them as an investigatory tool im just using it as a sentencing tool

8540384 we made it a goal this summer to take that brotherhood and make it mean something were including everyone from freshmen to seniors were all one team
8540385 we still think it will be a strong year for the defensive line
8540386 theyre just not battle tested on the field yet the defense is a philosophy we always had we want to make sure our defense is really strong

8540402 yesterday he the doctor and i were talking about the situation
8540403 steven said i will play with pain and after the li ge match have the operation he needs to do it
8540404 when we reached the final in athens no one remembered these qualifying games
8540405 the positive thing is we played a little bit better than we have been doing so against a good team we scored at the end which means the team was working really hard really pleased dirk kuyt scored the winning goal his effort is amazing
8540406 does this mean benitez needs more money for players or that maybe someone else should be spending it
8540407 over the two games i can say that the team with more luck and the bigger name won but they were not the best team
8540408 in two times 90 minutes we did not concede a goal we score one goal and we are out i have worked with mourinho i know him it is the mourinho story
8540409 we had chances we had a penalty in the first leg and did not score it is our fault
8540410 what seems to work is if its a marginal storm we can tweak out a little more snow
8540411 thats for our forecasters to pick up from the records
8540412 we now have two federal courts that have rejected wyomings position
8540413 may be viewed by federal authorities as being in violation of federal firearms law
8540414 we should not make it easier for dangerous abusers to get firearms
8540415 and weve seen that domestic violence abuse cases are extremely dangerous when guns are involved
8540416 we in fact had told applicants that were very concerned on whether this was going to be upheld on appeal on not
8540417 we said youre probably fine in wyoming but what are you going to do if youre duck hunting in delaware
8540418 i think its one of these situations where if youre going to call it an expungement it has to have all the characteristics of an expungement and frankly this law didnt get there
8540419 you cant say youre going to take it away for these purposes but not for these three purposes over there
8540420 you could have everything from a pushing shoving a minor thing that is isolated to severe beatings and you cant say that the first offender is related to the second offender not in my mind and i think thats what the statute is intended to do
8540421 yeah especially when three or four fish come up at a time
8540422 its so we can kind of keep our finger so to speak on the pulse of the fishery
8540423 it can do a number on you if youre not careful
8540424 we know its in the system we havent really seen the negative effectives like some states
8540425 i have some significant differences with mccain and george bush about the war in iraq
8540426 but one thing i thought wed agree to is to when the troops came home wed treat them with the honor and respect they deserve
8540427 in great falls theyre building a 6 5 million animal shelter and we dont have a shelter for veterans what does that tell you about priorities
8540428 i think theres a couple issues that are part of the cost of war and need to be funded over the long term like traumatic brain injury and post traumatic brain disorder and other side of the program we need to educate people i think in the long term this is a treatment and this is an investment
8540429 john mccain understands veterans issues better than probably anybody in america hes improved veterans health care worked with veterans affairs to add funding for claims and adjudication hes passed legislation to ease transition to civilian life
8540430 we dont owe him our vote because the stakes are too high
8540431 you just cant get in front of this fire right now
8540432 some of the northwest head of the fire has touched into musselshell county
8540433 but the vast majority of it is in yellowstone county
8540434 i know the aa is going to be competitive and i say that every year
8540435 but west is super talented in the skill positions they may be the fastest team weve ever seen i think cmr is going to be better great falls is going to be good and capital you never count them out flathead has brock osweiler and you cant count them out
8540436 i like our guys weve got 14 starters that started in the semifinal game weve got a lot of experience on the offensive front our quarterback is back and our running back is back
8540437 we sure dont ever want to be known as the city or state that got a presidential or vice presidential candidate injured
8540438 lets just say they were very generous in covering our costs and then some
8540439 i think hes probably just as sincere and dedicated to the propositions in the constitution as abraham lincoln was
8540440 when somebody does something outstanding we sing praise songs for them
8540441 we indian tribes of montana are honored by his coming here to recognize us one of our members is going to the white house and hes now a crow by clan by tribe and by all indians
8540442 im excited to be here to meet the next president of the united states
8540443 when they say obama is for change i think our country needs to have a different style of leadership in the white house and i think thats a good thing for our country
8540444 we owe him our gratitude for that but we dont owe him our vote
8540445 we cooked for bill clinton too we think thats why he was elected because he had great food
8540446 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8540447 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8540448 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8540449 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8540450 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8540451 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8540452 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8540453 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8540454 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8540455 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8540456 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8540457 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8540458 after we lost chris we went around the state telling the story and asking the people of montana demand government fix it
8540459 it really really touched me that he wants to take it national
8540460 chris was a brave guy and wanted to serve his country and he did he did more than i ever could have

8540468 you look around to see the openings and read the field
8540469 yeah its kind of like being the quarterback its just a matter of finding the players and getting the ball to them
8540470 and being in a new league great northwest athletic conference we had a lot to learn now we know what were getting into
8540471 everybody is playing amazing right now everybody is working really hard our aim is to have a good season and get into the ncaa tournament
8540472 you always want to stay healthy for an entire season its harder as the years go by im feeling it now
8540473 im more interested in getting people in the right spot to make goals
8540474 ive played the position quite a while you learn and then you start to know where certain people want the ball and who is going to get there
8540475 our job is to move the ball from side to side and create opportunities
8540476 one thing we have this season is a lot of upperclassmen before we were all freshmen and sophomores we have a lot of experience starting which will be good
8540477 our goal is to take it one game at a time
8540478 i came here liked the players liked the program and knew this was the fit
8540479 they say the first name then pause for a long time i dont know why its so hard my friends dont understand that either its pronounced just like its spelled

8540487 if the ultimate goal is to win a state championship and you havent done that you need to raise the bar every year and try to exceed the previous years performance
8540488 it was phenomenal if you ask me but when we got to the state tournament we werent able to put the ball in the back of the net so were looking for more scoring and i think well get it
8540489 you look at this year and were returning the most seniors weve ever had
8540490 my first year we were very young and we were still relatively young last year now all these kids are uppclassmen and its kind of nice theyve been to the state tournament the last two years and i think this year well be more composed
8540491 maturity is the big thing this year these kids have been together a long time its been fun to watch
8540492 theyre a strong senior team this year with strong senior leadership i think they know its their time theyre ready and they want it
8540493 were trying to sell the kids on our philosophy and mentality
8540494 itll take some time but the goal is to bring the program back to the level of a state contender
8540495 the thing we have to really work on with our guys is the possession game and being able to counter attack
8540496 these are new philosophies but so far its going well the guys have been receptive
8540497 our goal and we think its a pretty realistic one is to come out on top of the conference this year
8540498 were still fairly young but this group has played together for a long time
8540499 i think for me this is probably the most soccer experienced club that ive had
8540500 even in years past we were pretty good but these guys have played a lot longer top to bottom our depth is far better now than its been
8540501 we came out tonight with a plan at the plate i felt like wed gone away from that but tonight we had a pretty good approach to see the ball down in the zone and get the bat on the ball
8540502 we were fortunate that we took advantage of some good pitches and some good counts
8540503 thats often the case when you have a good aggressive offensive club like we do
8540504 youve got to sit back relax and just wait for your pitch i felt like we did a good job of that tonight
8540505 oscar got a couple pitches up and they took advantage
8540506 it was good to see him settle back in get the ball down in the strike zone and throw his changeup effectively
8540507 i think weve been playing pretty well and i hope we continue that win or lose
8540508 its to the point now where we have to start getting ready for the playoffs but at the same time you want to win every game you play so well go at it the same way we have been if we play good baseball i like our chances

8540511 nuestro pa s es menos seguro y est m s aislado ahora que en ning n otro momento en la historia reciente
8540512 malaysia has acceded to the government of the philippines request for an extension of imt international monitoring team a three month period is a reasonable time to bring together the peace process
8540513 we did not discuss any changes in the roles and composition of the parties involved in the imt
8540514 we valued the work of the imt in preventing the conflict from getting out of hand
8540515 we have a law to uphold here the enforcement of law is neutral on religion
8540516 our seventh and eighth graders have to go to castle rock but they should go to school here this is a k 8 district but we dont have the space
8540517 but the community out here has a history of supporting the school
8540518 sometimes the public is asked to do their part in making decisions about the school
8540519 that land purchase will give us space for adequate playground space a full sized gym and a parking lot that will help pull cars off the highway
8540520 after this we will have to start looking for a different site
8540521 if it occurs gradually thats great but if it happens at a rate that exceeds our ability to respond then its going to be a problem
8540522 eventually we will be up to 300 kids but we dont know if that will happen in one year three years or five years

8540524 they think theyre going to get us back up and going soon but at this stage were not comfortable to bring employees back much less the guests
8540525 theres been various times and stages when weve felt a little more comfortable than others but when its still burning in your backyard its tough to tell guests everything is ok
8540526 its not an even burn and theres still fuel out there
8540527 were working this as a fire suppression operation at least on the east end
8540528 that depends on availability and needs but one of the things we are usually able to do is provide more resources we come with more people 40 to 50 overhead people that are able to support a larger number of firefighters
8540529 its just more of the same but on a larger scale
8540530 the strategy to raise awareness is designed to enhance peoples confidence in public institutions
8540531 i wanted a visionary leader in education to give the inaugural audrey solberg smith distinguished lectureship in teaching excellence and dr pesut filled that tall order
8540532 he brought the perfect blend of grounded information with vision for the future and the sum of the two parts was electric
8540533 dr pesut challenges us to examine long held socially constructed assumptions about the delivery of education and to envision educational programs that are no longer bound by time and space
8540534 her gift honors the faculty who had inspired her so many years ago
8540535 dr pesuts lecture was in that same spirit of inspiration inspiring faculty to reach for news levels of teaching excellence
8540536 we cant believe it we love our book group so to be given this recognition from penguin and orange is such an honour
8540537 mainly due to unfavourable currency exchange rates a slowdown in consumer spending in some key markets as well as such ongoing economic pressures as rising shipping and marketing costs
8540538 the london based random house group outperformed its marketplace accounting for over 30 of all bestsellers listed in the sunday times
8540539 strategic realignment toward german and french language countries and southern european countries
8540540 in view of the difficult economic conditions we are satisfied with our business performance for the first six months of the year strategically we are now concentrating on growth initiatives following the portfolio measures in order to sustainably increase the value of our enterprise
8540541 its still a very important genre but theres an element of slowdown
8540542 we still sell misery really well but its definitely the case that there is fatigue in the market with too much publishing and too much mediocre publishing with publishers who missed out on the first wave are trying to get on the bandwagon
8540543 cest une honte pour tous les joueurs fidjiens qui se sont fait une place dans le championnat fran ais nous sommes d us et dans le m me temps embarrass s par cette attitude ce nest pas du tout professionnel de la part dun joueur que les supporters fran ais consid rent comme lun des meilleurs du monde
8540544 hebt u iets aan te geven ga naar de rode balie
8540545 i feel extremely lucky to be able to come back and finish out my college career
8540546 i didnt even get to play spring ball so im that much more excited to get on the field and hit somebody
8540547 not being able to step on the field is pretty miserable
8540548 everybody across the board from the secondary to backers to defensive line has leaders and gets their groups ready to play
8540549 we all motivate each other and try to get better
8540550 obviously its the best recruiting weve done in a long time
8540551 theyre two big strong kids that know the defense and are going to be a major help
8540552 be sound create plays and get the ball back to the offense
8540553 weve got more depth more experience and were just going to be flying around
8540554 from the ones to the twos everybody knows the defense thats a key
8540555 liked us to be out there coaching up the young guys and stuff like that
8540556 were a lot stronger and a lot more mentally tough than we were last year
8540557 theres a group of probably 25 guys right now trying to get better every day out there
8540558 i think we all have our eyes set on the playoffs as every team should our main goal is to make the playoffs and get more wins than we did last year for sure
8540559 hopefully the offense will be on the field most of the time
8540560 weve been very fortunate to be able to develop deep relationships with chinese institutions and this trip gave us a chance to officially get the wheels rolling on some exciting new endeavors
8540561 dr zheng truly has a passion for helping us build relationships with these prestigious chinese institutions
8540562 he and his staff have worked tirelessly to build our profile in china
8540563 i was glad dr maurer and his wife beverly were able to come to china and meet with the key leaders of these important institutions
8540564 these key leaders enjoyed their interactions with dr maurer and his wife and their presence really helped put the cap on a lot of important work that other unmc leaders have been doing here at the medical center
8540565 these strategic partnerships are allowing the station to grow at a steady growth both in web presence as well as listener base
8540566 like it or not there will always be more of everything
8540567 maybe theres a problem for remote files stored in a nas

8540569 hey jon hows it going we love your blog and love what youre doing for the guys and first and foremost want to say keep up the good work we do have a question though we were wondering if a sony person gave you those album covers or if you wouldnt mind sharing where you found them i promise we wont holler and scream its just the bands manager is kind of curious and asked if we could ask you
8540570 things that should be true but are the opposite of true

8540575 we tried to get a good set up for the rest of the test and the race in just a couple of weeks time and i think we can be happy with how it went today
8540576 the grip levels were very low and it was quite difficult with the tyres we had and especially as i had not been in the car for some time for a real test we did make some good progress though almost 100 laps with no problems and we are not too far from the others in the times either
8540577 with the aero configuration for monza being dramatically different to any other track we visit on the calendar todays programme focussed on evaluating different set ups and wing levels specifically for the italian grand prix
8540578 it was the size of a palm i think it hitched a lift with my husband hes back out there now but im petrified of spiders and i cannot live in that house until its gone
8540579 ricky was in my bedroom went into the drawer under my bed and something crawled across his hand he saw a huge spider and screamed to cassie
8540580 they tried to corner it but it was too big they poked it with a coat hanger and the spider bit it the dog came in and barked the spider hissed and bella went running out whimpering
8540581 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented
8540582 the youngest billionaire on earth and possibly the youngest self made billionaire ever
8540583 a percentage of those who pose a risk to the public
8540584 protection of the public comes first it is important that we treat every offender as an individual and in every case identify the specific risks which are posed so that targeted risk management plans can be developed and delivered to reduce them the agencies involved are committed to carrying out that process to the highest possible standards

8540606 power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
8540607 if the ue power control algorithm is faulty then they will demand more power from the cell than is necessary and with multiple users this can cause the cell transmitter to run out of power the net result is that some ues will drop their call i have seen the dropped call graphs that correspond to the iphone launch and when the 2 0 2 firmware was released the increase in dropped calls
8540608 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data
8540609 this is one of the reasons why at amp t has been sending text messages to users to persuade them to upgrade to the 2 0 2 software in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users
8540610 it is not the network that is fault but the interaction of the bad power control algorithm in 2 0 and 2 0 1 software and the network that is at fault the sooner everybody is running 2 0 2 software the better things will be having seen the graphs the 2 0 2 software has already started to make difference
8540611 autosol 4 0 has configurable and easiest software for designer layout designer and report designer and they can use this software without code changes and recompile real time report personalization using drag amp drop capability allow user to sort group summarize the data as needed while viewing reports users also get an option of saving their personal report and data called as my save reports it has got an option to import and export data into multiple formats like ms excel html text xml etc

8540621 whereas classical microscopes image one focal plane at a time cells are three dimensional objects and cellular processes are not typically restricted to one focal plane
8540622 this combined with the fact that cellular dynamics are often very fast means that detailed studies are often not possible
8540623 this technology promises to overcome significant limitations in existing approaches that have to date prevented researchers from studying central aspects of the functioning of cells
8540624 the new technology will permit investigations that are important to increase our understanding of how cells function

8540635 the afl is the only sport to publicly release the results of our testing
8540636 the drop in the rate of failed tests despite the significant increase in the number of tests is very pleasing
8540637 three years of results shows that taking immediate action in referring players to counselling and treatment is making a difference after 2000 tests we now have evidence that our approach is working to change behaviour
8540638 no other sports people in the country have volunteered for the out of competition testing and holiday testing
8540639 the working holiday scheme with new zealand will be a first for brazil and it will further promote the important links between our two countries
8540640 it will encourage young new zealanders to include brazil as part of their overseas travel and it will also help to stimulate the interest of young brazilians to live study and work in this country
8540641 when we asked for it you sent your men and women
8540642 they have gained the respect of our people we know new zealanders are our good friends
8540643 this high level visit is a good opportunity to look forward to the role new zealand can play
8540644 i think in these matters its best to proceed with all due care and deliberation and of course people are always innocent until proven guilty
8540645 helen clark has to stand him down just imagine the briefing note that visiting dignitaries get when they meet the minister of foreign affairs here is a guy whose misled the people of new zealand the prime minister and by the way his party is being investigated by the serious fraud office
8540646 would take some years for new zealand to get over
8540647 the serious fraud office is independent from government and treats a minister of the crown just like a private citizen and not above the law
8540648 i want to emphasise that it is entirely possible that there are innocent and honest explanations the use of statutory power to require documents to be provided will enable the sfo to ascertain how funds were applied
8540649 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose

8540691 the sca is an international organization dedicated to researching and re creating the arts and skills of pre 17th century europe
8540692 the sca is the society for creative anachronism which is a group dedicated to researching and recreating the middle ages in the present
8540693 these activities recreate aspects of the life and culture of the landed nobility in europe prior to 1600 ce the dress pastimes and above all the chivalric ideals of the period serve to unify our events and activities
8540694 what period and culture are you supposed to be from
8540695 why do some take an extreme stance on what the sca is suppose to be
8540696 according to the idea of the time period some people have we would have to rule out almost all middle eastern personas especially during the crusader time period
8540697 the ornament of the world how muslims jews and christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval spain
8540698 why do some take an extreme stance on what the sca is suppose to be
8540699 from the fall of the western roman empire 476 to the death of queen elizabeth i
8540700 in fact there are strong arguments to be made for pushing the nearer boundary to 1650 to include much of shakespeares later output and the 30 years and english civil war and the farther boundary back to whatever the year the roman empire definitively split into two pieces
8540701 there are other groups who cover the 17th century and people who want to do english country dance and stuff like that can play with those groups
8540702 in my opinion the rules that have been developed for the armored fighting within the sca have been developed by people with a confused agenda due to the lack of clear definitions of intent
8540703 the society for creative anachronism inc sca society is a nonprofit educational organization devoted to study of the middle ages and renaissance most of its activities take place in the context of a social structure adapted from the forms of the european middle ages which allows participants to take a first hand look at various aspects of the life culture and technology of the times under study as a living history group the society provides an environment in which members can recreate various aspects of the culture and technology of the period as well as doing more traditional historical research we sponsor events such as tournaments and feasts where members dress in clothing styles worn in the middle ages and renaissance and participate in activities based on the civil and martial skills of the period these activities recreate aspects of the life and culture of the landed nobility in europe prior to 1600 ce the dress pastimes and above all the chivalric ideals of the period serve to unify our events and activities for society members most of the world and all of the centuries prior to the 17th can serve as a source for personal research however the further you go from the core of medieval and renaissance europe the less the environment we offer will resemble what someone of your time and country would find natural or homelike for example you can be an asian or african guest at a european court but you cannot expect others to share your special interests like any long term visitor in a foreign land you are the one who will have to adapt to the customs you find around you since members have free choice of what areas they will explore it follows that society branches cannot decide to specialize in a specific time and place since that would make it hard for members there to pursue their own interests in other times and places
8540704 an attempt at pre 17th century clothing from the planet earth
8540705 my god did you bother to look in a mirror before you left your tent
8540706 educational organization devoted to study of the middle ages and renaissance
8540707 the further you go from the core of medieval and renaissance europe the less the environment we offer will resemble what someone of your time and country would find natural or homelike
8540708 that is a debatable point and i will not debate that with you
8540709 we will just have to agree to disagree in partial response to syntomes

8540716 the high inflation regime that prevailed during the second quarter took its toll on the philippine economy
8540717 economic growth in the philippines as well as those of asian neighbours was dragged down by high inflation and slower growth among advanced economies which hurt consumer demand

8540724 gareth wants to concentrate on playing on the best of his ability for aston villa and we hope this draws a line under the matter
8540725 i think gareth has played four games in quick succession with the one for england
8540726 four in 12 days after a stop start pre season which hasnt helped him
8540727 he will have better days for us than on saturday at stoke with a bit of luck but saturday might just have been a culmination of the four games in quick succession the lack of any steady pre season and all of those things

8540733 hari ini malaysia adalah contoh bagaimana rakyat yang terdiri daripada pelbagai kaum dapat hidup bersama dalam suasana harmoni melalui tolak ansur
8540734 setelah mencapai kemerdekaan selama 51 tahun kita hendaklah meneruskan usaha dan tekad untuk menjadikan malaysia sebuah negara yang bersatu dan maju
8540735 sensitiviti kaum harus dipandang berat untuk mengelakkan perselisihan dan persengketaan kerana ia mungkin akan membawa padah kepada perpaduan yang dijunjung selama ini
8540736 tindakan melakukan sesuatu yang dilihat tidak peka terhadap sensitiviti kaum lain perlu dielakkan kerana ia hanya akan menyinggung perasaan kaum atau pihak lain
8540737 jika perkara ini diabaikan mungkin akan berulang lagi detik hitam dalam sejarah seperti peristiwa 13 mei 1969 kita harus menganggap peristiwa itu sebagai satu pengajaran dan kita mesti belajar daripada kesilapan tersebut agar ia tidak berulang
8540738 merdeka merupakan suatu hari yang amat bermakna kepada negara melalui usaha dan pengorbanan pelbagai kaum barulah dapat kita mencapai kemerdekaan hari ini oleh itu kita haruslah bersama sama menghargainya
8540739 apabila membincangkan perpaduan kita tidak boleh mengabaikan mereka kerana etnik itu juga adalah rakyat dan ahli keluarga kita
8540740 ia dapat merapatkan hubungan dan memupuk persefahaman antara satu sama lain serta membantu menanam semangat patriotisme rakyat terhadap negara

8540750 saya ingin tegaskan tiada apa apa manfaat yang diperoleh daripada projek tersebut sama ada kepada rakyat atau kerajaan dividen yang diperoleh dari sepang gold coast dan morib gold coast lebih menguntungkan
8540751 kenapa mereka masih hendak meneruskan projek tersebut sudah tiada idea lainkah untuk bangunkan ekonomi selangor atau mereka tidak mahu meneruskan projek pembangunan terdahulu kerana ia adalah idea kerajaan bn sehingga terpaksa bergantung kepada babi
8540752 kita hanya dengar mengenai pelan pembangunan ladang babi itu tetapi tidak pernah dimaklumkan mengenai langkah langkah yang diambil oleh kerajaan selangor dalam memastikan alam sekitar tidak terjejas dengan pembinaan ladang babi itu
8540753 kita juga tidak tahu mengenai pengurusan sisa buangan ladang tersebut di mana segala sisa najis dan lain lain bahan kumbahan akan disalurkan ini penting kerana ia akan memberikan kesan yang amat buruk bukan sahaja kepada alam sekitar tetapi penduduk sekitar
8540754 i fully expect that our sales growth in china will continue at a very high level for many years to come

8540780 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle

8540788 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8540789 put the signs down for now well tell you when to put them up
8540790 i believe from the bottom of my heart with the right vision the right leadership and the energy and creativity of the american people there is no nation that we cant out hustle or out compete and no american need be left out or left behind
8540791 we have a press bottleneck between alaska and new york they wont move

8540800 i have provided channel seven with an interview and i havent been paid for that or any other media interviews
8540801 im not doing this for the money i just want to get the message out there
8540802 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8540803 i would much prefer girls to seek advice on contraception than be pregnant
8540804 the issue it raises is why this girl feel comfortable talking to her mum and dad about going on the pill
8540805 the message is to open the lines of communication and for other parents to use this as a teachable moment
8540806 the schools first action in these situations is always to encourage the student to talk it through with parents
8540807 where this is not possible or the student refuses to do so and the student is deemed at serious risk the wellbeing coordinators are obliged to assist the student in seeking medical advice
8540808 it is the general practitioner who decides what is best for the student and the course of action not the school
8540809 the problems that underlie these student health issues are very complex this means that application of the privacy regulations can at times be seen as at odds with parents
8540810 we need to look at why kids feel they cannot talk about this with their parents
8540811 if she had and the parents refused to give her the pill its not necessarily going to stop her having sex
8540812 i worry more about the kids at this age who are having sex and not seeking contraception
8540813 in abercromby street where my practice is the average male life expectancy is about 53 years old there is a high incidence of mental illness like depression which leads to a number of organic problems one of the postal sectors here has the lowest income in the uk that means people have less money to spend on basics like food clothes and travel to work its not surprising that we see more cases of heart disease stroke diabetes asthma and bronchitis than areas like lenzie
8540814 there simply isnt a pot of gold that can be magically drawn upon
8540815 we will be judged on how we deliver the resources to prove that making poverty history was not a passing fashion
8540816 the world has always been more impressed with the power of our example than by the example of our power

8540818 i made a lot of horror films but i wanted to do other things
8540819 i didnt want to be seen as a specialist in that genre
8540820 but with tokyo sonata i felt that audiences really appreciated the film and found it satisfying it wasnt that they saw it as something weird and exclusively japanese they could relate to it
8540821 if i were offered the chance i would like to try working abroad even in hollywood but i want to make films in my own way if that is appreciated by audiences abroad i want to do it
8540822 i am almost what you could call a rabid fan of ozu and i think i have been influenced by him even in my horror films
8540823 but i have never imitated him in fact ive spent so many years trying to avoid ozu i keep asking myself why the story and even the title have happened to follow on from ozu

8540900 my fellow democrats i say to you that barack obama is ready barack obama is ready to honour the oath is ready to be president of the united states
8540901 it is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8540902 the decrease is dramatic on the one hand its caused by falling hog prices on the other by growing feeder prices many farmers gave up raising animals many sows were killed so it may take up to two years to reach former levels of hog
8540903 the situation of polish meat companies is very hard the strongest ones will survive we may expect many bankruptcies this year especially of slaughter companies there are over 1 000 of them in poland while there is enough place for several hundreds only
8540904 expected to spread within the global food chain before 2010
8540905 these animals suffer from many more ailments and generally live far shorter lives from an agricultural perspective there are serious questions over the effect of this on the gene pool making cloned animals far more susceptible to disease
8540906 the prospect of animals being cloned for food is a hugely worrying one and should be stopped in its tracks
8540907 now your brain isnt that big but its devoted on your right side to something where youre saying thats a low value item for me

8540917 graeme picked up the injury during the ipl tournament earlier this year but he also tore a hamstring
8540918 he had five weeks out of the game which helped both injuries but we werent told how serious the tennis elbow was
8540919 during our first tour match at taunton it flared up while he was batting in the nets and our job has been to somehow keep him on the field for the rest of the tour
8540920 wed been giving him pain killers and anti inflammatories as well as icing and acupuncture but that innings which was far longer than we expected effectively nailed him
8540921 a tennis elbow is a chronic problem and one cant say how long the rehabilitation will take
8540922 we want to avoid surgery but if rehabilitation does not work well have to think again
8540923 on the surface there appears to be a disconnect between the higher port shipments and lower subscriber additions
8540924 but further analysis indicates that much of the growth was driven by shipments to china where the government mandated limited network growth in the third quarter due to the olympics
8540925 we believe a correction is likely in the second half of the year driven by limited shipments to china in the third quarter and lower demand in established regions resulting from slowing subscriber additions
8540926 has a good track record and he knows the industry and the company very well
8540927 across the advanced foreign economies information received since the last meeting pointed to subdued growth in the second quarter and increasing inflation pressures weak second quarter data on industrial production and sentiment in the euro area as well as on consumer expenditures and exports in japan suggested that the first quarter strength in output growth was not sustained conditions worsened considerably in the united kingdom with a deepening slump in the housing sector in all the major advanced foreign economies rising food and fuel prices continued to drive overall inflation to recent highs but core measures of inflation generally rose only modestly recent indicators for emerging market economies pointed to some slowing of growth in the second quarter real gdp growth in china moderated but remained strong incoming data suggested further slowing elsewhere in emerging asia and second quarter activity appeared to have remained sluggish in mexico headline inflation rose further in much of the developing world largely owing to higher food and energy prices and several countries continued to face upward pressure on core inflation as well

8540945 i think the view is that it seems less likely cibc is going to have to issue equity
8540946 where i disagree is the notion that the subprime charges are declining
8540947 the companys decision to settle with midas now permanently resolves this matter and removes the cost and distraction of this litigation going forward
8540948 gammon gold believes that the amount of the settlement is in the best interests of its shareholders in light of the cost and expense required to litigate in the united states gammon has and continues to deny any liability to midas
8540949 gdf suez has long been committed to developing alternative energy resources worldwide and further wind farm development in canada is a top priority for us
8540950 we are extremely grateful to the government of canada and ecoenergy for renewable power for its generous support and for helping us make the norway project a success
8540951 this method looks at the historical cost incurred to develop and create the intellectual property there are many inherent problems with the cost approach the most significant is that it fails to reflect the earnings potential of the intellectual property the value of intellectual property is derived from its earning potential and not its cost if the intellectual property offers significant economic advantage in an active market the use of the cost method is likely to understate its value if on the other hand development has been inefficient or lengthy the use of the cost method might overstate its value also for many identifiable intangible assets it may not be possible to develop a replacement or it may not be possible to estimate the replacement cost in its favour the cost approach is useful as a readily calculated bottom line valuation
8540952 220 years after beheading her on the grounds that she was a witch meanwhile britain still hasnt got round to pardoning its last witchcraft accusee
8540953 if one espouses the belief that the more the number of competitors the lower the price one could assume from that that with this high concentration of refiners in canada that we are paying a higher price at the wholesale level
8540954 while it may be of little consolation to canadians the volatility we have recently witnessed is not unique to canada
8540955 what is unique to canada is that notwithstanding this turbulence canadians pay the second lowest price in the western world for petroleum fuels
8540956 at least 70 per cent of canadas gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8540957 we respectfully call on the political leadership in canada to acknowledge this risk and support u s regulators to increase market oversight
8540958 it defies reason to me that all of this money can be coming into the market with no effect
8540959 like this is all kind of after the fact moving around and not doing something to the underlying price of the thing thats being examined
8540960 anyone with a lot of paper a bank or hedge fund can trade paper
8540961 first of all its cibcs first profit in three quarters
8540962 its a lot of relief on the fact that it looks like they have written down almost everything they had to write down you can assume maybe i hope that the worst is perhaps behind cibc now and they can move on and get into a profitable business
8540963 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8540964 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff

8540969 charge to compensate the company for rapid increases in energy expenses fuel expenses associated with network maintenance and higher related wholesale costs
8540970 if it were an electricity company or a shipper like ups i would understand
8540971 but a telephone company especially a clec competitive local exchange carrier which rents facilities from verizon does not have such extensive energy costs i feel betrayed as a customer
8540972 exterminators charging extra for gas to come to your house it has happened to me
8540973 the question that has been raised to us is if this fuel service charge is being added to bills for state services
8540974 there is no such charge in marylands approved intrastate tariff with cavalier we will invite them to come and explain to the commission to which services they are attaching this fuel service
8540975 thats among the things well be looking to clarify when we invite the company in to explain this to us
8540976 the charge is applied on a per account level for accounts that have interstate and or non regulated services
8540977 the customers invoice does include a bill announcement which indicates for full description of changes to erc see www cavtel com

8540979 many of those gemstones can be porous or nonporous so you have to be careful and take care when cleaning them
8540980 with everyday wear your gold rings and necklaces can be lodged with dirt and body oils

8540983 this is what ive been working my whole life for
8540984 i never would have written it this way i guess i went down to clearwater and cleared my mind i got back on track and now im here
8540985 the last time i think i played in the infield was 97 or 98
8540986 but it was a great feeling being at third base
8540987 it probably felt like the little league world series players you forget that you get paid to play the game its almost like we felt like little kids with the excitement in kind of a playoff type atmosphere which is pretty normal when we play the mets
8540988 id be lying to you if i told you i wasnt nervous about saturday because i am
8540989 i really want everything to work out i want everything to go as smooth as possible but on that way over to the stadium ill just be real real excited because this is a dream come true
8540990 i dont know how hes going to react to this ill probably know how it is in the hotel on friday
8540991 i completely understand ive been there i hope it doesnt turn out to be him being so disappointed that he doesnt want to be cool with me anymore
8540992 we were pretty good friends before and i think that we will still be
8540993 lets be honest there are people on the team that want him in
8540994 there are people on the team that want me in who i dont know
8540995 when theres an all out quarterback competition like that guys in the locker room are going to start to identify with somebody more than the other
8540996 i thought that was really important because that let me know how much confidence that he had in me to run a successful offense
8540997 my mother always told me that the ones with the most patience are the ones that benefit the most
8540998 i think its going to go down to the end
8540999 i think its going to be a good race its going to be a good fight
8541000 when weve got our bullpen healthy and organized i think we definitely have a little bit of a better bullpen
8541001 im down there for a reason to be used whenever charlie wants me to be used
8541002 i know down the road i need to be ready to do that get an out or two in the eighth at the end of the season these are big games so ill make sure im ready to go in whenever im asked to
8541003 russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8541004 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8541005 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8541006 in the midst of the georgia crisis i want to re affirm the commitment of the united kingdom to support the democratic choices of the ukrainian people
8541007 the georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8541008 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel the economic and political losses
8541009 if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course
8541010 i think that the government should be looking at all of the potential mechanisms all of the things in the locker that they have
8541011 after thorough consideration it would be too dangerous to do so
8541012 ive told the police not to break up the crowd but to encourage people to leave
8541013 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8541014 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution
8541015 i need to see him be better than he was last week
8541016 im not going to say he was poor last week but i want to see improvement he is on his second week here so there should be marked improvement there
8541017 theyre asking me to pick it up fast and im going to go as hard as i can but its somewhat of an experiment and its not guaranteed to work out
8541018 thats like me asking you how long it would take you to be an astronaut
8541019 if somebody hasnt practiced at something you can only expect them to do what you ask them to do and go 100 percent ive been there a week and a half so if i was comfortable there would be no point in going to camp for as long as we go to camp
8541020 we do that so people can practice a position and get better at it if a guy can just step in and be ready to go after a week then they wouldnt practice guys as hard as they do and wed save a lot of bodies
8541021 ive been here long enough and i havent been here long to know that you cant let anything surprise you i tell people all the time that i have the kind of job where i can come in and i might not have a job so being moved to a different position doesnt surprise me at all
8541022 oh thats easy white sox you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball south side
8541023 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie
8541024 imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8541025 i think he took us to a good place in the game
8541026 i wanted to go deep into the game but i threw a lot of pitches and fell behind
8541027 like i told the guys im tired of talking they understand the expectations and what i want for these guys is some success because of what theyve been through
8541028 hes more than ready to lead our team right now
8541029 i dont know who is going to start but you might see all four of them in the opener
8541030 learning from what we did last year were going to be a lot better
8541031 when youve done something for 30 years you are certainly going to miss it
8541032 but im going to channel all of the attention to a new position
8541033 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it
8541034 we dont see any reason to go beyond this were not going to have seven hour games
8541035 you can feel the energy building were all trying to get a win our first win in 48 years its a really big event
8541036 the best analogy i see is if you think about what happened at rutgers their football program started winning and their popularity soared
8541037 we want our name out there we are an excellent academic institution and through football we can get our name out there and tell our academic story
8541038 the way we view it is to provide additional opportunities for young people to enhance their college life
8541039 in a first year theres always a ton of teaching
8541040 its a two year process as far as the offense and defense and techniques and everything from an organizational standpoint because everything is the first time its new to everybody
8541041 i felt like i had to be a part of this
8541042 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8541043 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8541044 i understand that im hitting 250 and the fans are expecting a lot more than theyre seeing but the word the fan said trust me anybody would want to go there
8541045 right now ive been consumed with this fighting for the job as of now im just going to work hard and do my thing
8541046 dont give up dont ever give up and pat believes in jimmy v too sooner or later its going to work out
8541047 i never remember any point where i felt like man i lost the job today
8541048 if thats what the stats say thats what the stats say
8541049 i came out to practice tuesday and kind of had a slow start so you got to think that could have played a part in it youve just got to get back on the horse and keep working hard
8541050 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8541051 arbejdsgiverne m tage ansvar for de konsekvenser som overarbejdet har p de ansattes helbred det er bydende n dvendigt at virksomhederne ikke presser deres ansatte i en s dan grad at de bliver udbr ndte
8541052 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
8541053 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
8541054 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8541055 i appreciate the winners check and all of your support
8541056 whether we get a bunch of attention or we dont i dont think were going to feel pressure we know what we can do i think were good i think we feel comfortable with each other theres great communication going on so far im anxious and ready for us to get into a real game and see us put together a whole game
8541057 were a pretty cohesive group off the field and i think it carries on to the field
8541058 not only are we similar in age but i think in interests and work ethic so i think its a good thing that were all the same age were all young and in a similar situation
8541059 chris started 12 games last season so hes pretty much a vet by league standards and stews a smart player who did start last year its not like theyve never seen a start in the nfl although stew is picking up full duty this year from day 1 he has done well with the checks and things of that nature he and chris are very smart players so im not surprised at all how theyve progressed
8541060 assignmentwise and our communication i think we feel pretty comfortable
8541061 were making sure we know what were doing and being in the right spots to be able to make big plays you always want to stay fundamentally sound but i think were feeling pretty comfortable out there
8541062 for me last year i was learning the wil and the mik this year concentrating just on the mik i feel like im over the hurdle of grasping what it is im supposed to be doing and when a play comes when im just reacting so far most of my reactions are correct so thats a good sign
8541063 he has size 6 4 220 and great speed for his size
8541064 he has a chance to stick one way or the other
8541065 we encourage our players and work to get our people into the nfl
8541066 we sell that when talking to prospective players in the offseason come to philadelphia be on tv get exposure and get back to the nfl
8541067 its great exposure for the organization we want them to succeed and earn more money sure replacing them isnt easy but im always making calls on players behalf
8541068 from top to bottom it has become a good league
8541069 i think its because of the quality coaching you have in the league now where guys are all getting more numbers of kids coming out
8541070 garnet valley makes this league that much better believe me i know we know better than anyone else in the league how good garnet valley is we used to scrimmage them every year and watched their growth from aa to aaa to a quad a school theyve always had great coaching now they have great talent like i said we should know
8541071 our attitude coming into this year is we dont even talk about last year last year was special with a real special group of seniors who showed great leadership our goal is to establish a new identity with this team and this group of seniors who in my opinion have the same promise and potential as the previous group of seniors we had there are a lot of similarities there but well be faced with a number of challenges every week in the central league
8541072 i remember playing in the central league when you had a few weeks off not anymore the big difference now is everyone has a year round program where kids are committed to football theyre in the weight room theyre going to passing camps over the summer it wasnt always like that with kids in this league
8541073 playing and coaching in chester county the perception was that the central league was two teams ridley and strath haven and that was it
8541074 it has changed look up and down this league there are no guaranteed wins anymore now you have a garnet valley team with its skill players all back and theyre tested
8541075 all the things that most evaluators think are intangibles we think are very tangible toughness work ethic football iq leadership love for the game thats one of the reasons new england won all those championships they find those guys so we think they are very quantifiable too
8541076 ive been doing this for 16 years he might be as special as any player ive been around when hes in the huddle everyone knows it he has that thing about him at the end of last octobers akron game he just said lets do this temple won on a late touchdown drive some leaders are vocal others lead by example he can do it all he transcends all social economic groups and ethnic relationships it doesnt matter thats what makes him unique
8541077 coming from a guy whos been around college football and is really up and coming it makes you want to do some things for him and the program this year
8541078 i basically chose temple for a challenge when i first talked to coach golden he said the same thing we sort of clicked right there and then
8541079 i cant explain it any other way its like a kid waking up on christmas morning or riding a bike for the first time that kind of feeling
8541080 you just want to help your teammates in any way necessary i talked to the other quarterbacks when i could let them know what i was seeing out there nobody wants to sit around i spent the away games in my dorm room watching online on the internet it was different
8541081 i think the team gained some valuable experience as other guys stepped up we can build from that but being out once was enough for me
8541082 all i can do is my part i like the pressure of having some expectations with our defense if we put some points up well turn some ifs into more wins
8541083 when i found out i wasnt too happy about that
8541084 the only thing you can do is use that as motivation were not going to change our approach to anything we do hopefully its going to work out the way we think it will
8541085 a quarterback has to play and be smart at the same time i cant try to make the big play all the time ive got the easy job i just throw the ball the other guys have to run and hit and get tired
8541086 we just keep it moving as much as we can
8541087 and its getting closer to the game maybe thats why thursday is so long
8541088 then someones going to key on it so i have to change things up show people different things and mess around with stuff
8541089 i pretty much know where im going to be so i can mess with a guy
8541090 the hump its the hump thursdays the hump and fridays cruise control
8541091 but all i know is that i got to prepare myself like a starter
8541092 this is the best weve probably looked in about 3 years
8541093 we still have some holes on both lines and at linebacker but the team is coming together really well its the same way it is every year everyone is looking up at interboro until someone can consistently beat them
8541094 we wont be big up front but were running a new spread offense were probably going to run four wide in the gun
8541095 were getting more done in less time and well be more competitive on both sides of the ball well be a team that gets better each week
8541096 were young especially at quarterback but we also have an opportunity with three or four kids back that will offset that
8541097 bernard pierce showed a lot of growth and leadership over the summer and has developed even more as a football player we expect even more from bernard this year
8541098 if we play the way were capable of playing were capable of beating anyone on our schedule
8541099 the keys to us are always the same we have to play disciplined and execute what we do
8541100 the kids are working their butts off and we have kids playing football for the very first time i feel good about this team the kids are young why not win now four of our five losses came against playoff teams
8541101 due to the demand and limited number of available tickets for the sept 27 game the flyers are in discussions to add a game

8541120 we were never pressured out of the league we left voluntarily and were returning as a full fledged member of the del val league to play football this year
8541121 for one steve lennox isnt afraid to play anyone so rule out the fear factor
8541122 as far as interboro players thats a different story interboro players would love to play glen mills and thats a compliment to both interboro and glen mills theres no intimidation at all
8541123 we know we still have our detractors we know we cant please everyone all the time
8541124 we also realize we cant do anything about that people are going to think what they want to think were happy to be back in the league again we know what interboro thinks but we also know the interboro kids want to play us ive coached those kids in hero bowls theyre gutsy kids they have a great coach
8541125 personally i think glen mills definitely makes the league stronger
8541126 since ive been at academy park weve always scrimmaged glen mills and our kids were always up for that glen mills will be a fast physical team i have no problem with glen mills coming into the league
8541127 i know i can speak for interboro kids who i think would absolutely love the challenge
8541128 interboro kids and ridley kids are pretty much the same theyre blue collar hard nosed kids who arent afraid of anything
8541129 they have great facilities they get athletes with size they have great coaches who get their kids ready but over the last 10 years that interboro won the league they would have won the league anyway with glen mills in the league we always played glen mills at penn wood
8541130 now we have two playoff teams in the league interboro and glen mills
8541131 penn wood and chester could beat anyone on any given day i think
8541132 but i have no problems with glen mills being in the league i welcome them i live in the prospect park school district
8541133 i had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before thats the way it goes
8541134 hell probably say he was sorry and he didnt want to race that way he always does well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to
8541135 kyle didnt like the bump from behind but if you look at what carl did it was a pretty smooth bump and run to get him out of the way
8541136 what carl did was absolutely within reason what took place was just good racing
8541137 im a little worried because they completed it quite late its rather hard to grow grass this time of year we race pretty hard and if the cars go off course it could be pretty nasty
8541138 i dont know what the feeling is maybe its disappointment its probably a lot of feelings mixed into one
8541139 you work so hard for something you feel pretty good about it and the next day they tell you youre not going to start
8541140 theres still frustration if they put me on the field a little bit i guess thats what i got
8541141 as far as cliques i hope it doesnt get that way
8541142 but lets be honest there are people on the team that want pat in there are people on the team that want me in thats just how it is i guess well just have to play that one by ear i hope nothing bad comes out of this
8541143 honestly im really not sure if its for the duration
8541144 i think joe wants to see what happens saturday i mean i would hope its for the rest of the season but im not sure
8541145 since the competition was so tight its only right to play us both and see how it pans out it could easily have gone the other way pats a good player man
8541146 im going to have it for sure im going to take it i feel that i need it its another year to possibly take a run at a national championship
8541147 i dont expect to be hearing it in the next couple of days either
8541148 i got more important things to talk to my friends and teammates about than that
8541149 when we have our relievers organized and healthy i think we have the better bullpen with mets closer billy wagner out
8541150 we had lidge ready if case rudy got into a jam
8541151 but then when he got two quick outs we decided to let him go on delgado we talked about it it didnt work out
8541152 im down there for a reason to be used however charlie wants me to be used
8541153 i have to make sure im geared up and ready at all times my mind set will be to be ready at any time from here on out
8541154 now we need to just take care of business the way things are going i think the race is going to be neck and neck right down to the last week of the season
8541155 he responded well and now we feel he deserves the opportunity to show what he can do
8541156 i might have been putting pressure on myself to do too good
8541157 and i think it was a little bit mechanics i went back and worked with clearwater pitching coach steve shrenk he said do this do that two little things and all of a sudden my command was back
8541158 actions detrimental to stock car racing hitting another competitors car after the race had concluded
8541159 i think the accomplishment is secure because we know what we have done
8541160 but soccer in the united states was so small then philadelphia was an exception because the city and the media really showed interest in the team
8541161 i just look at it as a really good experience we know what it meant to us and the fact that these people still make a commitment 35 years later to come together really speaks about the camaraderie we had with each other
8541162 we had discussions about it many times and i still dont know just how it all came about
8541163 i will pat myself on the back when i say i did pick some great americans those kids had hearts bigger than lions
8541164 we american players were kids and had no frame of reference
8541165 i knew nothing about the other teams or the caliber of play
8541166 without question it was the most traumatic time ive ever faced as a coach
8541167 to lose those players was devastating but we had gotten that far and preached all year that it doesnt matter who is on the field
8541168 ive won five championship rings in my lifetime and that was without question the most special
8541169 its an incredible story an expansion team winning in the fashion we did is our legacy
8541170 you have to remember that in 1973 soccer was not even on the horizon
8541171 i can understand why it has been forgotten because of the history of soccer in the united states
8541172 i think its going to go down to the end
8541173 i think its going to be a good race its going to be a good fight
8541174 its who wants it and who plays the best i guess
8541175 games like that weve got to win who knows it could
8541176 weve got santana weve got a big load weve got to go get it
8541177 the other team gives you inspiration lets put it that way
8541178 and when youre able to take that and keep yourself motivated it helps
8541179 but there wasnt a real big deal made out of it well i take that back one of the coaches was yelling it wasnt that big of a deal for everybody else
8541180 we were hoping they would find in our favor but i think its the reinstatement committee that we really need to talk to
8541181 the staff pretty much did what it has done in the past in this case but the reinstatement committee has the authority to make its own decision so thats where our hope lies
8541182 and you dont know the extent of it so it scares you when the ambulance comes we know hes in good hands
8541183 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8541184 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8541185 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8541186 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8541187 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8541188 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8541189 each year we go by the same motto we can only control what we do
8541190 what need to concentrate on is leave last year behind
8541191 we dont have the major impact guys as we did last year but the overall talent level of this team is better than last year
8541192 i see us like this well have enough guys where well be in every game we play even with the best teams
8541193 we have some veteran players back who played a lot last year but well have to learn fast with those four to start we expect to compete with everyone in the league but well be a team that gets better as the year goes on
8541194 well win our share of games but the key for us is winning those swing games
8541195 we will have speed and we want to be competitive each week
8541196 the key is the offensive line and plan on getting better there
8541197 were pleased with the progress of our skill position players
8541198 well have to be injury free to have a good season we dont have the size up front as we did last year but were a little more athletic garnet valley is definitely the team to beat they have a good nucleus of kids returning from a state final team and an excellent coaching staff
8541199 we have a lot of talented kids but this is a transition year
8541200 its a new new coach and we open with ridley the key will be getting the kids to buying in and then getting it going
8541201 we think well be competitive and we also think the league has gotten a lot better over the last couple of years

8541305 the coach feels nkatha did not satisfy him as well as he would have wanted so he will consider him in future assignments but certainly not for this game
8541306 in the press there have been many negative things said of our great state in relation to the primary

8541333 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses
8541334 as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities
8541335 the reality is that this management and this board have failed investors and failed their public mission
8541336 why should we have great confidence that they have finally made the right choice after stumbling
8541337 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8541338 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8541339 the weakness in the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8541340 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good

8541351 we cant believe it we love our book group so to be given this recognition from penguin and orange is such an honour lauras book group has made a difference to all our lives taking on a life of its own with catch phrases weekend agms away culinary experimentation and stimulating friendships with people we would otherwise have never met the benefits have been more than we would ever have expected three years ago
8541352 we felt lauras book group demonstrated exactly what we were looking for a total passion for books literature had seeped into every area of their life with their annual awards meetings in themed venues etc
8541353 it was also tremendously encouraging for me as a writer to see such enthusiasm for literature amongst such a young group of professional men and women who obviously have full and busy lives but who make time to read and discuss books together
8541354 weve had such an interesting mix of entries this year congratulations again to lauras book group who demonstrated a genuine passion for books and their group

8541361 i cannot justify taking this money out of the pockets of people who are struggling when there was the opportunity to have it be a viable private business that contributed to the tax base in calvert county
8541362 we thought at some point it would turn a profit and be able to pay its own debt
8541363 i think it is a very good choice and a good decision to purchase this course
8541364 ultimately the bondholders were made whole medcos image was made whole and calvert county i believe paid too much for this golf course
8541365 yes it has been on hard times but it is now in as good as condition as it ever has been
8541366 dont mind putting money in other facilities and getting no revenue at all
8541367 we need to decide whats worth keeping in the classroom and what needs to be abandoned if we are going to prepare students for the 21st century
8541368 we will not confine our children to our learning because they were born for another time
8541369 in the 20th century it was all about memorizing content but today its not just about that its about being able to integrate other skills like critical thinking communication and technology skills
8541370 parents educators and policymakers all know things have changed over the last 50 years and we need a new model in education to match those changes
8541371 this is a project of massive scope but must be approached with minute precision
8541372 we will be analyzing skills more looking at new technology and implementing strategies so kids become self directed learners
8541373 the new division of labor how computers are creating the next job market
8541374 theres no question we want students to get better at basic skills but thats not where all the good jobs will be

8541377 the big difference is that israel will start importing an increasing amount of high tech equipment not just consumer equipment
8541378 the israeli market will understand that china is not only supplying cheap materials but also items which are really high tech
8541379 this is a trend that is likely to change the trade between israel and china
8541380 it is simply part of the global trend of chinas growth and is not just specific to sino israeli relations the fact that chinese exports surpassed germanys doesnt really mean much for the israeli economy

8541383 unless we get out of these sanctions its going to cost the government of guam an large amount where instead of the federal government taking care of our administrative costs were going to have to pick up the bill so we dont want to see that happen were currently seeing a reduction of the administrative sanctions lets see in the unlikely event that this were to be imposed on us the 156 000 thats the initial sanction will be close down to 40 000 for the first year or first quarter

8541428 im just so happy for danny he won the u s amateur championship
8541429 its amazing also that he and i both won our championships on pinehurst no 2 and it must be something about the course that favours new zealanders
8541430 ill never forget the reception i received when i went back home with the u s open trophy so i can imagine what its going to be like for danny bringing the u s amateur title back to new zealand
8541431 but its a fantastic achievement to win one of the greatest amateur titles there is in golf and to also eclipse tigers record now as the youngest winner
8541432 its just incredible and im really looking forward to catching up with danny and congratulating him personally
8541433 gov corzine has clearly expressed that he would like to see this issue resolved as quickly as possible through the legal system
8541434 it affords us adequate opportunity to brief the issues and to address the merits or lack thereof of the governors arguments
8541435 i have accepted recognized and acknowledged that my bad choices have caused a lot of grief and inconvenience to individuals and institutions
8541436 lots of times the law doesnt work for poor people and this is a prime example
8541437 we didnt know nor did we condone the practice of our employees charging parents for field trips as a condition of attending those events
8541438 this settlement reimbursement will close the door on this chapter of the concerns of parents of h b wilson
8541439 we believe we are the only ones in the country doing something like this on this level
8541440 its downtown its a historic area its run out of a bike shop and its free
8541441 given that weve got one week before school starts this looks to be the best solution going into this school year
8541442 the spirit in which we want to negotiate is that no one is worse off under the arrangement than was planned before
8541443 that was not done in this case thats very unfortunate and thats not the way the school district wishes to conduct itself

8541450 there were a couple of the jurors who had decided already that she must be guilty because she was arrested and it was in all the news
8541451 i believe in the interest of justice that a new trial should be granted
8541452 i believe the verdict at trial would have been different

8541468 essentially the meaning of the album is religious to be submerged in the music is to be engaged in an act of faith i know that must sound like sheer wackiness but the best songs on the album are riffs off religious music and the ultimate effect is one of trance like devotion to a superior being or vast ephemeral untouchable truth
8541469 no the music isnt especially good but for me its a direct conduit to very specific places and times nice places to visit but im glad i dont live there anymore
8541470 even weirdos can bust out some dopeness and when they do they ought to be recognized for it which in this case would be the astronimical sale of 26 million units thats a lot of worn out tape decks and needles people

8541472 while ill fully admit that kiss is not a band with any kind of earth shattering music talent twere it not for them there might never have been a poison a slaughter a twisted sister without those bands i might not have had the high school realization that i myself like to rock
8541473 many of the songs even seemed annoying to my wide eyed teenage self then now they just plain suck however the packaging and marketing of that album would pave the way for fetishism of the rock brand rather than the rock band
8541474 all in all i remember a lot worse shit in the late 60s early 70s than jethro tull
8541475 i was pretty wasted that day but i may well have been the guy that threw the frisbee

8541485 every song is good or great and shouldnt be compared to their live recordings to determine if it is good or not it is simply a good record frankly i am a bit annoyed this is even up for debate
8541486 is this the csn and sometimes y album that has the track impregnating lesbians on it oh wait that came later

8541489 i also find it hard to believe that in 10 years all you heard about him was drunken shenanigans he has toured constantly with and without elton john during those years wrote and released an album of piano compositions had a tony award winning hit musical on broadway that is still being produced on the road wrote an anti war song for a new young artist donated much time and money to numerous good causes and done an extensive tour of colleges around the world speaking to students of music and music business he even designed a boat which has become a successful business in itself

8541492 thats the section of beach where we had a massive beach fill done in late june if theres anything floating in the water its going to come up there
8541493 remember were talking about less than 10 percent of the entire beachfront
8541494 which could cause panic to an individual if he or she were unaware of the possible cause due to a lack of knowledge of the spraying
8541495 exacerbated by the sounds of low flying aircraft and the presence of a mist of unknown origin
8541496 a direct correlation between the infection rate of mosquitoes and human illness
8541497 being able to spray is a very positive step to protect pennsvylania citizens
8541498 sympathetic to our position that there was a gross lack of notice
8541499 initial indications from our mosquito traps in montgomery county suggest that the spray was highly effective
8541500 if people are concerned and want to take additional steps weve listed those steps
8541501 the risk of virus from these mosquitoes is greater than any risk from this very low level of pesticide
8541502 this stop snitchin is going to be the end of us all if we continue to let it run our city
8541503 fear is not an option dont let me see you do it com
8541504 a lot of people think this snitchin theme affects only certain areas
8541505 its not just north phillys problem its not just west phillys problem its everybodys problem no one should dismiss the fact that this is going on
8541506 these kids dont understand that death is permanent death is real
8541507 thats when i saw the difference between dead ends and roads that continue through life
8541508 you can walk three blocks and find just about any drug you want
8541509 theres a group that says dont snitch this is the opposite of that if you do it and i see you do it im telling its as simple as that i dont want to go to a funeral were trying to deter this stuff from getting into our neighborhood
8541510 then the neighborhood gets taken over at that point you have an uphill battle
8541511 we need to get more involved in ending this snitchin concept so many lives have ended and weve seemed to reverse our values theres no honor in this code just chaos
8541512 we went back over some film and saw my arm slot was dropping down
8541513 i was slinging the ball so we just worked on getting my arm back up and once we got that slot again the curveball started coming back to me a little bit
8541514 my first game up i had a couple good curveballs tonight was the first day its kind of come back to me

8541524 i was just in paris and i was thrilled to see their program and all the bikes on the street
8541525 the potential is there to turn philadelphia into an incredible bicycling city an incredible green city
8541526 renting for one day costs as much as joining for one year
8541527 i go back and forth from my office to court now i can rent one of these

8541529 smartbike is intended to provide riders with the missing link between existing points of public transportation and desired destinations
8541530 there are plenty of bike shops where tourists can go and rent bikes
8541531 im trying to use them how do i use them
8541532 if there was a way for tourists to sign up that would improve it

8541534 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of human rights violations with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
8541535 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
8541536 it is high time for the ioc to put its core values of
8541537 never has enough been said about native issues in my opinion but were getting there
8541538 were getting to the table we just need to make ourselves comfortable and start participating
8541539 realistically speaking this is not an indian conference its a democratic conference which represents everybody
8541540 in some areas were probably over represented though we native americans can never truly be over represented according to history
8541541 from what ive seen on tv and cnn i really havent seen that much
8541542 without that knowledge its hard for them to understand where were coming from
8541543 i think theres an intent to include more natives in the agendas
8541544 i think were saying it but we cant just be telling it to ourselves
8541545 if we were to play today which its pretty darn close it would be carona
8541546 that doesnt mean we wont look in on it from one week to the next
8541547 its good but if the next week fowler outperforms him then well play fowler

8541550 and there was this fat guy who was dancing and i was all like get up out of my face and stop dancing near me
8541551 o lavori cos oppure te ne stai a casa tua
8541552 a sollevare il pene mostrandolo agli agenti seduti alla scrivania
8541553 un accadimento che insegna come momenti di buio si possono verificare anche negli ordinamenti democratici con la compromissione dei diritti fondamentali delluomo per una perdurante e sistematica violenza fisica e verbale da parte di chi esercita il potere
8541554 bisogna utilizzare tutti gli strumenti che lordinamento democratico consente perch fatti di cos grave portata non si verifichino e comunque non abbiano pi a ripetersi
8541555 for me and aaron its an opportunity to play against the best
8541556 its going to be pretty cool to see how we match up against those guys im sure theyre going to try to do their thing and were going to try to go out and compete with them
8541557 theres some similarities to harrell and crabtree as far as building off last year and what they were able to accomplish
8541558 they both mean a ton to the program theyre not only great players but great leaders in the offseason theyre walking the walk and theyre tremendous assets
8541559 there were numerous times last year when we both saw something and took advantage of it
8541560 they call me grandpa they call me pops they say my old bones are creaking they say ive got arthritis but as long as i can still handle them on the field they can say as much as they want when we get on the field the old guy wins
8541561 i was 21 years old and watching college football every year
8541562 it was amazing i couldnt begin to explain how i was feeling
8541563 football has always been my passion and my love its a way to express myself to let out my emotions in a positive way
8541564 hes not afraid to say what hes thinking good or bad hell let guys know
8541565 some guys dont understand the best way to go about that but lex is a really intelligent person on and off the field he never ceases to amaze me with his leadership
8541566 if it doesnt say kellogs on the box its not kellogs in the box
8541567 as you can see i am completely out of breath
8541568 im still not yet at my full potential but im trying my best
8541569 i am still a long way from where i want to be
8541570 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it and it wont even be noticed
8541571 you can slow a picture down so much that you can see the grains of sand and the clay around the bag you can see whether or not a person has shaved that day
8541572 the commissioner has come around and hes embraced it because the technology is undeniable im sure there was a time when all of us watched baseball on black and white tvs now i bet you everybody in the room has a high def tv
8541573 the commissioner has been very clear were not going any farther than weve gone
8541574 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8541575 im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8541576 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8541577 what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8541578 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8541579 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8541580 that was our first international regatta and that was very cool
8541581 you have to go out and race like its a final in every heat
8541582 hopefully we can go out there and do a great job its always good to represent your home team
8541583 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8541584 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8541585 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8541586 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing
8541587 i was thinking of going home to scotland probably for 10 days or so over those first two tournaments seeing the family taking a break recharging and coming back
8541588 we didnt have him in team work tuesday but he did fine and hasnt experienced any problems
8541589 so far so good hell get a little more work today
8541590 weve been telling you guys that hes been doing a lot of things and we have a pretty extensive workout before we let guys get back on the field
8541591 they go through a routine on the side and do some individual work and its like a decathlon
8541592 so when we clear guys to come back i usually dont worry about how theyre going to be
8541593 its still to be determined from what we do and a lot of that will be based on the medical report on jim and peyton
8541594 so those guys gray and lorenzen are both going to play well see how they do and then well determine whether we keep four three or two
8541595 but hey you know what they say when you assume
8541596 the trade situation has already been presented the game doesnt really matter
8541597 marc edouard is one of the top young defenceman in the game and we are excited to have him in to fold for the next several years
8541598 he has a tremendous future with this franchise and we look forward to watching his continued development
8541599 u s news is not a moral code its a set of seriously flawed rules of a magazine and i follow the rules without hiding anything
8541600 for instance very often the value proposition of small colleges revolves around building education on strong personal relationships and personalized stewardship of the students educational experience nothing threatens this deliverable like moving classes online technology can start off as a supplement for enriching face to face quality and wind up replacing it
8541601 politicians may want to take a closer look at the eus privacy directive
8541602 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8541603 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8541604 i was just trying to come back to normal position where i could just stand up and regroup again and play the next point
8541605 i thought i was going to get my dress really dirty that was my biggest concern
8541606 i would have loved to take a nap on the court because i was really exhausted but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8541607 some weekends i feel like we have a dominant car and other weekends i feel like were a fifth place car or even a 10th place car
8541608 with the strong team we have we seem to be able to rally back and get finishes out of it so i still think that we are maybe behind
8541609 in different weeks the 88 car earnhardt has been the car the 24 gordon was the car early we were and its just tough to really say where were at
8541610 its been tough for him and its been a huge huge challenge for him
8541611 but more importantly the go to moves that weve always had with the old car do not work with the cot and to kind of retrain chads brain and look at things in a different way that is the hardest part for him
8541612 the latest greatest moves and the stuff we thought was going to work based on the old car and we were not even in the same race
8541613 we were out there in a seven cylinder class it seemed like that has been the hardest part to find out where to work and thats what weve done all season long
8541614 there is not anyone smarter than chad but the way he has thought about setting these cars up and what we have done in the past doesnt work with this new car
8541615 we are trying to find the right direction in the right areas to turn him loose and let him work
8541616 gerrard has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days
8541617 we play with a lot of pride and we take pride in winning those championships year after year
8541618 the fact that were hosting next year doesnt take away from that
8541619 theres a lot on the line as far as pick ups go being the league champion versus the host representative so we have that in the back of our minds as well
8541620 so we want that championship both for pride and for first choice from around the league
8541621 wah udah pulang tuh mas masih lumayan muda jadi manggilnya mas
8541622 oh my boy belongs to st peter no st gabriel errr or was it st paul errmm how many disciples did jesus actually have
8541623 which even the channels which promise to deliver fail to do so
8541624 are more of entertainment channels with small bulletins of news squeezed in here and there
8541625 so youre saying that ive never seen you here in the past 8 years but youve been here the whole time
8541626 im like a ninja and you better watch your mouth now
8541627 och dagen kom n r det var farligare att f rbli i knopp n att sl ut i blom
8541628 were really looking forward to seeing the young kids this year
8541629 we have a lot of openings on our roster and there are also a lot of opportunities to move up our depth chart we dont have a lot of veterans back this year so its the kind of year that young players can really make an impression
8541630 i think everyone knows we will be a pretty young team this year
8541631 this is the type of season that our rookies will play a lot and will gain a lot of experience we want to build our team up again so we can be one of the best in the league in a couple of years
8541632 what we plan to do is evaluate how ready our rookies are at forward and also on defence and then make a decision about where we need to keep our 20 year olds
8541633 we already know what our overagers can give us and were comfortable with the type of players they are but we want to make sure we have a good balance in our line up and were not too weak in one area
8541634 all the signs are that he will be in columbus but youre never sure of anything until it actually happens
8541635 i told you to stay still when master holds you but it is his fault for holding you up so high up for such a long time are you alright my dear
8541636 theres this huge black and white head staring at me
8541637 that must be your daddy say hi to him while youre still there
8541638 oh nevermind were you trying out bungee without the ropes you may end up going there aunt latara went last half moon phase
8541639 never mind him dear do you think you can get back up here
8541640 here comes the tentacles i am floating woooooooo ouch mommy hes pinching my toes
8541641 much has been happening as of late we got one of the clan member dead with reason still unknown i dont need another one going to the land of no return
8541642 yeah i overheard master talking about tika amp medith going to their new home this weekend luna amp eclipse just went away
8541643 oh these are the kits they have been here for quite a while and i was wondering who they were
8541644 wow this is really my empire i have my kit falling from the sky and i see my kits every corner i turn
8541645 mommy this giant is ugly it has fur stuck out on its body
8541646 your time will come too and it is call the great fur fall
8541647 do what you want but your never gunna break me sticks and stones are never gunna shake me no ooo ive got a pocket got a pocket full of sunshine ive got a loving i know that its all mine wish that you could but you aint gunna own me do anything you can to control me
8541648 youre fallen star youre the getaway car youre the line in the sand when i go to far youre the swimming pool on an august day and youre the perfect thing to say

8541660 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
8541661 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
8541662 i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand
8541663 we already provide our network access for gameplay for free and the interesting thing about the network side and the internet business is that theres a variety of revenue sources not necessarily getting people to pay but with advertising and so on
8541664 those are things were looking at and learning how we can provide a service without people having to pay but we still get our operation running with funding from somewhere so that we can maintain the level of quality we want
8541665 it was our best performance so far and to be honest i am disappointed that we didnt get something from the game
8541666 we gave away bad goals again and that keeps killing is as it did last season but this is not a crisis the run without a win is a concern but we are not far away
8541667 i will be working to the final minute on the final day of the deadline to do business
8541668 i want to strengthen again because i want to move upwards i am happy with the effort the squad has given they are giving me everything and i think the performances are getting better but we cant keep giving stupid goals away like we have been doing
8541669 we should have dealt better with both of burys goals on saturday and the result was a defeat which i didnt think we deserved overall
8541670 but when you concede kami kaze goals like we did you cant expect to win games we need to get our first win because the longer you go without it the more pressure is put on the players
8541671 people have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power

8541709 its commitment as a human rights defender to protect the rights of all its citizens and to observe the universal declaration of human rights
8541710 everyone has the right to life liberty and security of person
8541711 everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law
8541712 any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity
8541713 to maintain the momentum on addressing killings of activists and media professionals
8541714 the military is in a state of denial concerning the numerous extra judicial executions in which its soldiers are implicated
8541715 all those who will be put at risk by an individuals testimony
8541716 as long as we do not have the testimonies of the witnesses we can never file formal charges
8541717 not a criminal action requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt nor is it a civil or administrative proceeding but a prerogative writ intended to protect human rights
8541718 this life is a short journey how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
8541719 just as there are direct victims of drug crime there are also collateral victims the people who live where one drug dealing property can pull the entire neighborhood down
8541720 there are wonderful people here working hard to fix it up we look out for each other
8541721 the d a is about justice and this was an obvious mistake
8541722 trying to get through to anyone there was a nightmare
8541723 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8541724 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change barack obama will deliver that change
8541725 im pretty sure it was when my sister was at ursuline academy in wilmington delaware and joe was at archmere academy claymont
8541726 closely connected with cities through his leadership on crime issues
8541727 is like 98 percent he brings an open door evaluation of obama to every working family
8541728 i think the accomplishment is secure because we know what we have done
8541729 but soccer in the united states was so small then philadelphia was an exception because the city and the media really showed interest in the team
8541730 i just look at it as a really good experience we know what it meant to us and the fact that these people still make a commitment 35 years later to come together really speaks about the camaraderie we had with each other
8541731 we had discussions about it many times and i still dont know just how it all came about
8541732 i will pat myself on the back when i say i did pick some great americans those kids had hearts bigger than lions
8541733 we american players were kids and had no frame of reference
8541734 i knew nothing about the other teams or the caliber of play
8541735 without question it was the most traumatic time ive ever faced as a coach
8541736 to lose those players was devastating but we had gotten that far and preached all year that it doesnt matter who is on the field
8541737 ive won five championship rings in my lifetime and that was without question the most special
8541738 its an incredible story an expansion team winning in the fashion we did is our legacy
8541739 you have to remember that in 1973 soccer was not even on the horizon
8541740 i can understand why it has been forgotten because of the history of soccer in the united states
8541741 i just saw history where hillary clinton released her delegates to obama everyone had tears in their eyes
8541742 basically anyone who was not able to secure a spot in a hotel within downtown denver is forced to take a lengthy trip into the city for events every morning and out of the city from events every evening
8541743 denver is essentially a driving city its sprawling nature is not conducive for an efficient public transportation system
8541744 introducing an environmentally safe cab company would have been both a distinguishing feat for the democratic national convention and a solid investment for the city
8541745 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get 10 to 20
8541746 i am mindful that only yesterday in birmingham ala our children crying out for brotherhood were answered with fire hoses snarling dogs and even death i am mindful that only yesterday in philadelphia miss young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered
8541747 given the virtual absence of substantive differences between the two democratic rivals its difficult to imagine these core supporters not voting for obama when push comes to shove if it turns out that more than a handful of them dont clinton style feminism will be exposed as an absurdity as opposed to something thats badly out of date
8541748 is in severe financial distress despite current managements implementation of extensive restructuring and cost cutting measures
8541749 shalvis talent for penning excellent stories has never ceased to amaze me

8541755 jill shalvis is a breath of fresh air on a hot humid night
8541756 f as in fat how obesity policies are failing in america
8541757 i think its going to go down to the end
8541758 i think its going to be a good race its going to be a good fight
8541759 its who wants it and who plays the best i guess
8541760 games like that weve got to win who knows it could
8541761 weve got santana weve got a big load weve got to go get it
8541762 the other team gives you inspiration lets put it that way
8541763 and when youre able to take that and keep yourself motivated it helps
8541764 but there wasnt a real big deal made out of it well i take that back one of the coaches was yelling it wasnt that big of a deal for everybody else
8541765 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8541766 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured
8541767 the hospital like any other business is going to try to recoup its cost by charging other people more
8541768 now looking at the tough global environment we are into the next phase of transformation which is making our business from linear to non linear
8541769 more services making acquisitions to get platforms offering platform based services and more significantly we going to offer all this in as on demand service software as a service saas we just launched that because when you do that you completely delink revenues to headcount
8541770 my own sense is that the worst is behind us and in the second half there will be less and less impact
8541771 because primarily at niit technologies we changed our business model and we are in the mode where we are making our business more non linear so that growth in revenues is not directly proportional to growth in headcount
8541772 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8541773 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8541774 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8541775 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see

8541779 most of the people in the division have about as much vision as stevie wonder
8541780 this is going to be a great asset for the fulton community and the parks system
8541781 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died
8541782 these kids are having huge parties during the school day
8541783 sometimes they have over 100 kids no area is not involved
8541784 i got the big goose egg and i want to tell you i went places that i dont often get to go
8541785 the sense was the streets kind of rolled up and locked up for the night which is part of what we wanted to accomplish
8541786 just the planning and implementation of it in itself was a success
8541787 people dont really care what uniforms there as long as the police are there
8541788 i was real pleased with the officers just getting out in the communities
8541789 there may have been a minute decrease in the number of people coming in but im still swamped
8541790 you cant read this report and say the problem is getting fixed
8541791 some people are trying to keep up with the joneses and they get into trouble
8541792 are you willing to see headlines saying theres a decline in test scores and teacher salaries and there are more portable classrooms which we are already the king of
8541793 i hate to put it in those terms but thats what were looking at
8541794 parents want to walk their kids in on the first day of school
8541795 but starting tomorrow i am not going to let them in they will have to sign in as visitors at the front office
8541796 i told them i want to come to school here with them its a great new environment
8541797 a hope in the unseen an american odyssey from the inner city to the ron suskind that was published 10 years ago the humanities council selected the book from more than 80 others after a lengthy vetting process aimed at finding a book that would appeal to teenagers and adults
8541798 there is the well documented decline of reading in the adult population and that is a strong inspiration for communities to do this
8541799 the other thought is that it really is a great way to get people talking within their community and it is part of our initiative to generate discussion around the state about race and race relations
8541800 at the college we are very excited to have that
8541801 reading used to be much more of a communal experience people dont read for pleasure anymore
8541802 we are dedicating our lives to the social issues that underlie the book providing equity in education
8541803 is like going to the nba all star game and the opera at the same time
8541804 then my mom told me this is something that not a lot of kids have the opportunity to do
8541805 she said this is going to be part of history and she didnt want me to miss out on seeing it a lot of people said that to me so i finally realized how important it was
8541806 it felt like we were seeing one of our own i know hes not from prince georges but he is prince georges
8541807 you see this individual this american and this african american and its like hes the first person in your class to do something big by having a chance to be president of the united states
8541808 in the early days you hear him and what hes saying makes sense and you sign on you see people responding to his message and people around the world listening to him and you get excited that it can happen
8541809 this whole thing is like going to the nba all star game and the opera at the same time the show is going to be great but just being in the town as this historical event is happening is exciting in itself just witnessing it is exciting
8541810 many kids in this county come to school from deep poverty
8541811 were getting families who normally wouldnt sign up for supplies but with the recession they just arent making ends meet
8541812 what is happening in the economy is really affecting people
8541813 its just something you have to do as an educator i just pull out of my own resources now i wont have to do that i can come here
8541814 these working families are trying to provide the basic daily necessities so imagine those same families trying to find additional money to buy the school supplies their children are required to have
8541815 killings and torture committed by military security forces protecting and paid for by emoi
8541816 sufficient evidence at this stage for their allegations of serious abuse
8541817 until now i had no idea about that if its true ive just learnt about it from you
8541818 just go ahead and sue the one who will be sued is exxon right
8541819 non votarlo un giovane negro che non sa fare la guerra
8541820 are very familiar too familiar with police brutality and excessive force
8541821 more people are armed carrying around firearms and more willing to shoot at police officers
8541822 i cannot justify taking this money out of the pockets of people who are struggling when there was the opportunity to have it be a viable private business that contributed to the tax base in calvert county
8541823 we thought at some point it would turn a profit and be able to pay its own debt
8541824 i think it is a very good choice and a good decision to purchase this course
8541825 ultimately the bondholders were made whole medcos image was made whole and calvert county i believe paid too much for this golf course
8541826 yes it has been on hard times but it is now in as good as condition as it ever has been
8541827 dont mind putting money in other facilities and getting no revenue at all
8541828 looking for god in harry potter is there hidden meaning in the best selling books

8541834 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8541835 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8541836 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8541837 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8541838 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8541839 i dont know how i can live now because none of my family is left

8541848 google map maker solves an inherent need especially for countries such as ours where maps data in sparse this product embodies our passion to empower people everywhere to share knowledge of the places they know best by creating maps
8541849 it is identical in terms of location to the application they made which was subject of the appeal which they lost
8541850 it is in the same field it just uses a larger area notwithstanding the fact the area is larger we still consider that the field is totally unsuitable
8541851 the site at corse is further back from the road than our original application its a bigger site to enable more landscaping
8541852 the alternative site at tirley is even further off the road network and we will putting extensive landscaping around them
8541853 when i drove up to my street it was nice house nice house nice house
8541854 the house was a rat hole grass a foot long raccoons out back digging around the garbage it was just brutal
8541855 but it had a bed a fridge a washer dryer and a shower thats all i needed
8541856 it was pure training no outside distractions just boxing and sleeping kind of like when i first turned pro when i was living in the gym
8541857 there was no screwing around all my life ive always wanted someone who wants to work as hard as me with other trainers i had to push them stephans just as hungry as me
8541858 we are in the process of increasing the number of isaf troops in kandahar province
8541859 theres a feeling of enough security that people feel confident enough that they can make that call
8541860 that level of confidence doesnt exist in some parts of the province so they cant make that call because they fear for their lives
8541861 in zhari and panjwai theres only about a third of each of those districts where any sort of development can take place the rest of them are under too much threat from the insurgents and the people dont have the confidence to go there and work
8541862 thats the piece that weve got to turn around and one of the reasons were standing here is to say hey its all not doom and gloom were fighting as hard as we can on their behalf to bring security its going to take more time and its going to take more forces
8541863 enabled us to locate and destroy weapons caches and explosive materials
8541864 do we have enough soldiers and policemen to secure this province at this time the answer is no and thats why we are pursuing all these other initiatives
8541865 its about geekery and having a focal point for great ideas
8541866 could we ever know each other in the slightest without the arts
8541867 the funding that the smaller dance companies get to tour is lifeblood to them they do not have enough performances in their hometowns to be able to survive they have to tour

8541870 bredesen also acknowledged that while he has concerns obama is a virtuoso performer who cant be underestimated
8541871 i dont think thats the right thing to hold the event at invesco field but they are not asking me and they have got a great track record so far
8541872 i would love to see him out showing a certain kind of humility being in touch with people who go to breakfast at the waffle house sending a message
8541873 barack obama est preparado para liderar a los estados unidos y restaurar el liderazgo del pa s en el mundo barack obama est listo para ser presidente de estados unidos
8541874 hillary os dijo ayer de una manera inequ voca que har lo posible para que obama salga elegido en noviembre este compromiso habla por los dos
8541875 al final mi candidata no gan pero estoy muy orgulloso de la campa a que realiz
8541876 los republicanos me dec an que era muy joven y muy inexperto para ser el comandante en jefe os suena familiar no les funcion en 1992 y no les funcionar ahora porque barack obama est en el lado correcto de la historia
8541877 obama nos conducir lejos de la divisi n y el miedo de los ltimos ocho a os y nos devolver la unidad y la esperanza
8541878 luchar para que estados unidos tenga m s aliados y menos adversarios
8541879 y lo que es m s importante barack obama sabe que eeuu no puede ser fuerte fuera a menos que sea fuerte dentro el mundo deber a estar mas impresionado por el poder de nuestro ejemplo que por el ejemplo de nuestro poder
8541880 if you look at what has happened over the last several months i think there is a convergence basically the bush administration has moved in the direction of its critics in trying to internationalize the reconstruction process so i am not sure that on paper the differences between the bush administration and a kerry administration would be significant
8541881 and i think that there is a strong impression that the bush administration has squandered its will on the international stage and that john kerry would come in with a broader vision and the possibility of bringing people onboard in a way that is necessary for our long term success
8541882 presidents often talk about the importance of their personal relations with other leaders but essentially that is a lot of hooey you know nations do things because of national interest

8541886 die meisten pflanzen ben tigen viel mehr licht als fische auch sind f r ein pflanzenaquarium eine bodenheizung spezieller bodengrund sowie eine co2 d ngeanlage empfehlenswert
8541887 damit jede pflanze genug licht bekommt sollte man darauf achten dass niedrige pflanzen nicht von hohen pflanzen beschattet werden
8541888 am besten macht man sich vorher eine zeichnung davon wie das aquarium sp ter aussehen soll und plant bei bedarf auch eine terrasse ein
8541889 die zierfische in einem pflanzenaquarium sollten an die lebensbedingungen der pflanzen angepasst sein keine pflanzen fressen oder im boden w hlen

8541900 the word scramble gave the impression that it was a little too haphazard
8541901 i think the city has made it clear over the last number of years that the no 1 priority is pedestrians no 2 is transit three is cyclists and four is the car
8541902 this is an experiment to see if pedestrians are able to benefit from this and if we are able to get drivers to cope
8541903 we have two primary goals in adopting sales performance management
8541904 the first was to find a solution that would allow us to quickly model new plans in order to keep up with the ever changing requirement of our business the second goal was to select a sales performance management platform that our many divisions can standardize on making our processes and procedures uniform across the business varicent spm was selected based on their ability to provide us the speed flexibility and visibility for our sales compensation across all of our business units
8541905 we are excited to add smith amp nephew to our growing list of customers

8541914 although a younger workers total accrued benefit at retirement age will be greater under the cash balance formula than an older workers if both started at the same time the difference is due to the time value of money rather than age discrimination

8541916 the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues

8541933 patients who used statins before an ami heart attack and continued to take them after were 16 percent less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them
8541934 so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your heart attack it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8541935 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami

8541992 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country

8541999 nasa uses the technology for imaging in space and it works here
8542000 if we are working on the basis of our mutual interests then its logical to implement this agreement
8542001 this is an old way of doing things that has nothing to do with modern realities
8542002 primarily i think the u s was looking for things to take away and penalize russia for in georgia
8542003 this is a vote of no confidence in improving u s russian relations

8542023 theyre moving to address this theyre moving in the right direction

8542033 krisengerede ist daher auch f r den mittelstand fehl am platze der personalaufbau setzt sich fort wenn auch verlangsamt
8542034 der dihk rechnet f r das gesamtjahr 2008 mit einem plus von 350 000 stellen allein im mittelstand er ist und bleibt somit das r ckgrat des deutschen arbeitsmarktes

8542057 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges
8542058 and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8542059 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan
8542060 when i returned from iraq i realized we didnt just need change over there we also needed to change how we treat our veterans here at home
8542061 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand with soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed weve had a president who spent billions on private contractors but not on body armor for all our troops
8542062 for the past eight years the man in the oval office has tipped his hat over his eyes kicked back his chair and snoozed at his desk while his vice president conspired with oil industry cronies
8542063 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do

8542066 these cds lack warm tones and depth and i still resented this forced move until i heard the jose carreras placido domingo and luciano pavarotti concert album it is a powerful all digital dream conducted by zubin mehta and recorded in july 1990 under a full moon at the ancient baths of caracalla in rome its a tenor blitzkrieg a vocal wonder sharp crisp and heavy on high end operatic latin schmaltz in short its my kind of record there was something else i actually liked about the cd player i could load five discs onto it same as i could on my parents living room record player
8542067 wed wind up sitting around listening to music on your computer
8542068 as we face difficult budget times at both state and local levels of government this bill has the potential to help protect us from cuts to important city services such as public safety

8542071 youll start seeing some revenue right away but it wont be that much
8542072 these are not revenues we are going to realize overnight this is a long term investment it is something that proved effective 1992 with arco and were hoping will be this time around
8542073 the oil field is in need of investment in order to maintain current oil production levels as well as potentially increase production and revenues on a long term basis
8542074 avec des hausses respectives de 13 et 6 les secteurs des biens d quipement et des biens interm diaires auraient les investissements les plus dynamiques a linverse ceux du secteur
8542075 we welcome any new treatment that comes to the market that may potentially improve the quality of life for people living with overactive bladder
8542076 incontinence still has a huge stigma attached to it and many patients feel isolated and suffer in silence with it for many years as healthcare professionals we need to challenge the stigma and consider new ways of raising awareness and encouraging patients to seek help and take control of their condition
8542077 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8542078 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost

8542084 it would be up to a judge to set an interim mortgage rate this bill wouldnt help people with no income and no prospect of an income
8542085 what you get from foreclosures is blight and devastated communities
8542086 what were trying to do with this legislation is keep homes occupied because once these homes go vacant everyone loses

8542112 are you kidding me folks talk about being for it before you were against it let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8542113 its about whether or not you can look your child in the eye and say were going to be alright
8542114 maybe if you have a tumor you can shoot somebody in the head and get away with manslaughter
8542115 out of the earshot of any jurors and that there wasnt anything found to be derogatory or prejudicial
8542116 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
8542117 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
8542118 he said im sorry we dont take women because they cant handle the work
8542119 it is important to just do the right things and do them well
8542120 always be a lady dont be one of the guys
8542121 the added social aspect of a phone conversation causes me to give repetitive short and contradictory stock answers
8542122 with e mail interviews i make every answer different otherwise i say the same thing over and over because there is no time to think of a better one
8542123 living in a candy jail with peppermint bars peanut brittle bunk beds and marshmallow walls
8542124 you tend to be more appreciative of the things in your life when you get back from hell in that sense i feel lucky that i can write what i can and what i have in those other times i never saw myself as the lucky person i am
8542125 it used to depress me when id read about raymond carver writing 100 drafts of a story id think i could never do that i guess i can never be a writer if you can learn to do it do it you have to stay patient and stay working past the point where the song is good enough if the song can be taken further it needs to stay in the shop longer
8542126 there is no way in hell he should have been deployed the army saw him as just another set of boots on the ground
8542127 from the second tour on he changed 180 degrees three deployments is two too many the army took my husband from me the army destroyed my husband
8542128 army leaders are fully aware that repeated deployments have led to increased distress and anxiety for both soldiers and their families
8542129 there appears to be a direct relationship between the incidence of suicide and the number of deployments which of course is no surprise
8542130 the army is making great strides in treating soldiers with post traumatic psychological symptoms as well as decreasing the stigma associated with treatment for these symptoms
8542131 were not here to make you better were here to make you deployable
8542132 everyone treats you like crap theres a huge stigma to asking for help
8542133 but the real problem is the ptsd the real problem is the mental health condition
8542134 now making them better may mean taking them from a non deployable to a deployable status obviously theres a war going on but the goal is making them better
8542135 anything that burned reminded him of the sights and sounds of picking up bodies at the pentagon
8542136 chad would get very severe migraines that would knock him to his knees
8542137 he served his country for 12 years he went through more hell in one year than you and i will in a lifetime
8542138 the army takes suicide prevention very seriously we are honor bound to ensure we do everything possible to minimize potential risks
8542139 just had to sit and talk to someone over a tv
8542140 i thought well if thats how theyre going to treat you at least youre talking to someone
8542141 i know that he was by himself he sat in his room and played a video game
8542142 the outcome as well as patient satisfaction was the same
8542143 she was telling people she was going to kill herself
8542144 she had evidently told people about the history of abuse
8542145 she was laughing and singing she was sent with a male to the chaplain the chaplain couldnt speak very good english told her to start obeying orders it was a series of people who could have done something better
8542146 friendly fire because they failed to take care of a fellow soldier
8542147 he just kept doing it he was in love with her she was trying to get away from him
8542148 he verbally and physically assaulted her it was reported to the higher command
8542149 he was e mailing her and e mailing her and e mailing her she wouldnt answer his e mails he went into her room killed her and then he killed himself
8542150 the last time he assaulted her he drove around looking for her that was probably a week or two before he killed her
8542151 i asked after the second assault what did yall do then the only thing they told me was a lot of mistakes were made
8542152 chaplains are constantly working to prevent suicide at every level most importantly at the soldier level
8542153 caution is warranted in beginning changing stopping and or continuing
8542154 they sent him to anger management classes feeling somewhat deserted by his father he was so young they had also put him in suicide watch in boot camp
8542155 that is a suicidal medicine especially with teens i was livid i just couldnt believe they put him on prozac
8542156 both prozac and paxil are in the class of medications called ssris which are a very safe category of antidepressants
8542157 and they put me on something else they changed my medicine gave me a week of stress management
8542158 i dont think he should have ever been sent there why would you deploy someone who was a danger to himself and maybe others when they know its just unacceptable pushing them out there
8542159 det mener jeg ikke det er for den der har m dt gud som sin k rlige far som en n dig og k rlig gud har m dt kristus

8542167 people who get involved with the red cross tend to make this part of a long term service commitment
8542168 when a disaster happens lots of people want to respond
8542169 to really be able to respond we have to have trained volunteers

8542171 nine of out 10 lifeguards are trained by the red cross
8542172 traditionally that means connecting family and service members in times of a family emergency
8542173 that to me would be a good example of taking a traditional program and looking at the community to see what are the most pressing needs
8542174 in this community one of those needs is service to wounded warriors
8542175 now he jokes around and says thats going to be his retirement
8542176 now they are all trying to see who can come up with the most exotic one
8542177 he was out on the road doing some stuff and he found something like 9 000 in cash
8542178 we cant afford to sit idly by not in this race and not in the presidential race
8542179 he believes in the majesty of the nation its ability to take care of itself and the value of personal responsibility
8542180 youll get what you see and youll see what you get
8542181 the change theyre talking about in denver is the little bit of change youll have left in your pocket
8542182 really how could you tell its from me if you havent opened it
8542183 he admitted doing this and was seen carrying a ladder and caulking
8542184 every auctioneer brings new ideas on how to make the event bigger
8542185 if pat bourke the executive director calls me up and asks me to go pick up something ill go thats why i say im a gofer but i dont mind because i enjoy helping out
8542186 what i do benefits the organization but it also helps to keep me busy
8542187 i enjoy doing things for other people and since im retired this is a great time for me to do it otherwise i would be just sitting at home so if people have a chance to help others they need to do it
8542188 he always makes himself available and does it with no hesitation
8542189 he picks up donations and makes deliveries using his own vehicle his own gas and his own time hes someone i know we can depend on
8542190 its an organization with a big heart it makes you feel good to know that you are also doing what you can
8542191 ik denk dat spore even groot in omvang zal worden als the sims alleen hoop ik niet dat het met dezelfde strategie zal gebeuren
8542192 met the sims verkochten we in feite steeds weer opnieuw uitbreidingen aan dezelfde consumenten
8542193 ik denk dat spore zich prima leent voor een horizontale uitbreiding waarbij we bepaalde componenten als levels en editors pakken en deze op een andere manier aanbieden aan mensen die nooit de hardcore pc game hebben gespeeld zo krijgen zij een lichtere ervaring en gebruiken zij de content op een nieuwe manier buiten de spore game
8542194 it was almost 5 000 contacts in this region alone
8542195 weve got coyotes to check on gators to catch its something all the time
8542196 theyre telling us they dont have a list of specific parks or historic sites because they dont yet know exactly how much money they will have to work with
8542197 ive been doing this off and on for about five years
8542198 a lot of us are temporary but were all bound because of dance
8542199 were trying to get people to see what well be doing in the family y class
8542200 en realidad nuestras fuerzas entraron en la zona del conflicto despu s de que rusia desplegase sus tanques en nuestro territorio al pasar a trav s del t nel roki hacia osetia del sur
8542201 si mosc puede retirar al gobierno de georgia elegido democr ticamente entonces puede intimidar a otros gobiernos democr ticos europeos d nde termina todo lo que sabemos de rusia especialmente del actual r gimen no es alentador
8542202 si mosc trata de derrocar nuestro gobierno con la utilizaci n de instrumentos letales entonces hay que resistir con los instrumentos democr ticos que han mantenido la paz euro atl ntica durante m s de sesenta a os
8542203 apoyar a georgia con instituciones pol ticas y financieras de europa es una respuesta poderosa
8542204 dado el aumento de las fuerzas de la otan en el mar negro la flota rusa ha comenzado a tomar medidas para supervisar su actividad
8542205 una vez concluida la visita los buques continuar n cumpliendo misiones de paz en las zonas de seguridad anunciadas
8542206 no planeamos aumentar nuestro n mero de barcos all pero todo depende de la estabilidad regional
8542207 estamos controlando las aguas territoriales y el rea adyacente para asegurar la seguridad de los cargueros y prevenir el contrabando de armas y de veh culos militares
8542208 tiene como objetivo el cambio unilateral de las fronteras de georgia
8542209 gran responsabilidad en no iniciar una nueva guerra fr a
8542210 reexaminar la naturaleza la profundidad y la amplitud de las relaciones
8542211 given that our forecast for the national and local economy is bleak and augusta has started to show moderation in its quarter over quarter employment growth we forecast a slower 0 3 percent growth for 2008 consistent with a statewide slowdown
8542212 for 2009 we forecast a 0 2 percent decline in annual employment level
8542213 in 2009 well see the decline slow to 2 600 losses before the recovery strengthens in 2010 where we can expect to see 61 700 new jobs
8542214 as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god
8542215 if you are going to do it you should do it silly
8542216 i think something like this should be sort of a little party barge it should have some silly stuff hanging off of it
8542217 there should be banners there should be flags i mean im pretty sure well run up the skull and crossbones
8542218 years ago we would just tie together a bunch of inner tubes and throw a piece of plywood on top
8542219 and thats when the race would go through the rapids
8542220 sure the course is only a mile but there were some rafts last year that didnt make it a half mile
8542221 the real reward is putting it in the water and discovering that it floats
8542222 after that it doesnt matter if you win lose or sink halfway
8542223 i have to be on it because i built it
8542224 we saw hope that this country could go in a different direction i feel a rekindling this whole campaign and now this week here feels like a rebirth the countrys coming alive
8542225 when you know of someones work for 30 years you tend to know the person
8542226 it was my estimation that she was the best candidate
8542227 she made it clear to us and everyone else that she is behind obama
8542228 you could tell he was in pain we were concerned he would pass out
8542229 to think about what he sacrificed and what his family gave to the democratic party and this country made what he said that much more powerful
8542230 we run a 24 hour seven days a week organization but we have a limited staff
8542231 thats the reason its so important to have volunteers we do a lot but theres no way we could do it without volunteers
8542232 we will have in depth sessions with speakers from different agencies that we work with
8542233 though we cover several topics all of them are related to each other the training is designed to give volunteers the foundation they need to go in and be an advocate
8542234 we have in services and we offer extra training that way
8542235 also we dont put them out on their first case by themselves they are paired up with a more experienced staff member or volunteer to give them a level of comfort and confidence as a volunteer
8542236 it takes a special kind of person to volunteer for our agency
8542237 our volunteers give a lot of their time and it takes a lot of dedication
8542238 the goal of the event is to help empower women by providing information on things like health and finances
8542239 we want them to gain the knowledge to help themselves and other women
8542240 we are coming together to help improve our mind body and soul in a positive environment while being a positive influence in our community
8542241 we chose to talk about healing gardens because that is one of the newest things people are talking about now
8542242 healing gardens usually contain something with a fragrance which relaxes you a small water feature which is also soothing and a place to sit to take it all in the beauty of it is that it can be a large or small space
8542243 we make what seems to be a large task simple for everyone
8542244 our city is in good financial shape with high bond ratings no general bonded debt 16 years of excellent financial report ratings and our yearly audits have indicated no major concerns
8542245 yesterday he the doctor and i were talking about the situation
8542246 steven said i will play with pain and after the li ge match have the operation he needs to do it
8542247 when we reached the final in athens no one remembered these qualifying games
8542248 the positive thing is we played a little bit better than we have been doing so against a good team we scored at the end which means the team was working really hard really pleased dirk kuyt scored the winning goal his effort is amazing
8542249 does this mean benitez needs more money for players or that maybe someone else should be spending it
8542250 over the two games i can say that the team with more luck and the bigger name won but they were not the best team
8542251 in two times 90 minutes we did not concede a goal we score one goal and we are out i have worked with mourinho i know him it is the mourinho story
8542252 we had chances we had a penalty in the first leg and did not score it is our fault
8542253 hey olga lets go down to the pie cellar theres something in there i want you to churn
8542254 if we have to reduce those kinds of dollars its going to be pretty draconian
8542255 it would be a large personnel reduction i would try to keep it away from direct patient care areas because if they affect the payment rates we would still see the patients
8542256 the assumption of an additional 2 million reduction at a minimum would be extremely problematic on the campus side
8542257 with the states priority of training more physicians and a priority on the medical education initiative that there ought to be a cut it doesnt make sense
8542258 so what do you do with a windfall gain of one million dollars cash or a few
8542259 hong kong has a fantastic number of great restaurants here incredible hotels and macau next door is the little las vegas which has had an incredible boom in terms of restaurants
8542260 we hope we can find some very good one star two star and three star places in very small places
8542261 demasiado feminista y resulta una mala influencia para mi mujer
8542262 its weird you think if you give someone a bonus that it will make them work harder like they werent going to work hard in the first place do you remember that
8542263 but if i pay a bonus it destroys that if i pay a bonus its like i am saying
8542264 it looks as though the hurricane is on track to inflicting damage
8542265 it would be very difficult to be in a short position today and tomorrow
8542266 everything you need to make your small business idea flourish
8542267 ik heb nog een contract voor n jaar maar de steun die ik heb gehad toen ik de transfermarkt opging was fantastisch
8542268 ik ben zeer tevreden hier ook omdat de club veel progressie maakt
8542269 een linkerverdediger ik heb n speler in gedachten en dat is het dan weer voor wat betreft deze transferperiode
8542270 there are two kinds of people in the world those who love chocolate and communists
8542271 russland braucht gute beziehungen mit dem westen ebenso wie der westen gute beziehungen mit russland braucht
8542272 die wirtschaft ist global die ereignisse an der new yorker b rse zeigen schon am n chsten tag auswirkungen in tokio und dann auch in moskau wir sind miteinander verbunden und m chten deshalb dass sich unsere amerikanischen partner lieber um ihre wirtschaft k mmern
8542273 i wish a man from far away would come and take me
8542274 a pretty girl far away wants a husband i wish i could go to her
8542275 i will help you if you will do as i direct you you must shut your eyes and pray to me and i shall grant your desire now begin
8542276 now fly up the river and early in the morning you will see a girl bathing near four underground lodges she is the wife that you desire
8542277 why do you fly so close to my head you black ugly bird you will blind me with the dirt of your feet
8542278 if you will become my wife i will release your clothes
8542279 you must be my husband for you have seen my naked body
8542280 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8542281 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy
8542282 marvel acuma e open minded marvel da creatorilor libertatea de a zbura cu idei
8542283 degeaba spun ei asa vreau animatie japoneza totusi ei ce vor nu e asta ei vor ceva hybrid intre animatia japoneza si cea vestica
8542284 a lot of times in budget times we are deciding between robbing peter to pay paul
8542285 its my role to bless this city and to bless gods people for what i do for now im coming out of pocket for this but hopefully someday ill receive some official financial help
8542286 we thought it was all fluff then but who knew
8542287 it was an honour to receive this last year and it remains an honour to accept this this year
8542288 of course he didnt like that very much and at that point told me that if i put his picture on the internet he would call his laywer i assured him that his photo would be on the internet and he then walked up and grabbed my camera lens
8542289 no child no matter how wealthy the parents needs to be provided with more than three ponies
8542290 maoart paintings integrate with virtuosity real peoples faces into faithfully reproduced propaganda posters based on a photograph provided by you and a poster of your choice an artist renders you as a socialist hero

8542293 we are very open to anyone who would want to join us as an investor
8542294 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8542295 isolation is not feasible russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8542296 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts
8542297 from our point of view this would be absolutely adequate response to what is happening in georgia
8542298 russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region
8542299 considering its actions in the which are on the other side of the world
8542300 in all international institutions we will need to review our relations with russia
8542301 by this project ucb aims to increase focus on its core assets re deploy its resources
8542302 techni kai saugi termin bet ne ilgiau negu kol bus pastatyta nauja atomin elektrin
8542303 its an issue over which we have no jurisdiction and theres nothing we can do to change anything with respect to the language
8542304 the secretary of state provides us the language and we accept it
8542305 if someone doesnt like that they need to take it to some other forum
8542306 it is your obligation to ensure that voters are presented with a fair and honest description of this important ballot issue
8542307 there are only two ways of telling the complete truth anonymously and posthumously
8542308 many of the tales were about jizo who is one of the most popular of japans deities and is more commonly known in japan as ojizo sama or ojiso san jizo is a bodhisattva one of the main figures in mahayana buddhism the branch of buddhism most commonly found in japan korea china and the united states the bodhisattva will withhold his or her own leap into nirvana in order to be reborn again to help others jizo is one of the most popular of these bodhisattvas and appears in the form of a buddhist priest in order to be a comfortable and familiar figure to help those in need any tourist trekking japans countryside and visiting roadside temples will quickly notice the many stone statues that litter the rural streets of japan these are the statues of jizo they are often clothed in stone robes and hold canes and are dressed in red bibs they are often bald smiling serenely with eyes closed some however are faceless formless stones only distinguished by the red bibs and aprons wrapped around them
8542309 senjya fuda might display the name occupation and or sometimes a unique message from the visitor to the shrine or temple so in a way fuda would serve as a calling card or even advertisement left behind by a visitor
8542310 a granite ring monument symbolizing wisdom which has been adopted as an emblem of the town
8542311 i always thought that strategy was essential to the success of a new business
8542312 but after watching these presentations it struck me that the personality and character of the founder of the business is in fact more important than the strategy itself
8542313 given the size of the settlement it plainly falls within the range of settlements that your honour would find fair and reasonable
8542314 i think it makes sense and i cant see any loose ends
8542315 when the true state of the company was revealed to the market its share price collapsed and 2 billion came off its market capitalisation
8542316 it was involved in businesses in south america that werent travelling the way they hoped and instead of revealing the true state of its business to the market it chose to fudge

8542319 i remember the first time president clinton ran for office in 1992
8542320 he came to cleveland i must have been 8 years old
8542321 my mother got the chance to meet him they have been best of friends ever since
8542322 im going to be with her until she says stephanie im no longer in this fight
8542323 if you give somebody your word youre going to go ahead and do it
8542324 if you dont have your word you dont really have anything to stand on in politics so thats one thing i did learn from my mother at a very early age
8542325 she always said that if you dont stick by somebody in the bad times you never know how good the good times are going to be
8542326 she wouldve been standing up hooting and hollering saying wow

8542328 la armh espera que el juez de la audiencia nacional baltasar garz n tenga en espa a la misma preocupaci n por los desaparecidos forzados que est teniendo en otros pa ses

8542330 fundamentales para que los familiares de las v ctimas tengan un punto de referencia
8542331 la desaparici n forzada de personas es el peor crimen que puede existir porque conlleva no s lo la tortura f sica en su momento sino tambi n la tortura psicol gica durante los a os que perdura esa desaparici n
8542332 lleva exhumadas en algo m s de siete a os 110 fosas comunes
8542333 espera la intervenci n de las instituciones espa olas para que se responsabilicen de la b squeda de los desaparecidos
8542334 en una democracia que se preocupe por los derechos humanos deber a ser garantizada por las instituciones del estado y no por grupos de voluntarios
8542335 espera que el juez garz n incluya a espa a en la aplicaci n de la justicia universal e investigue el paradero de cientos de desaparecidos a causa de la represi n de la dictadura franquista
8542336 tenga en espa a la misma preocupaci n por los desaparecidos forzados que est teniendo en otros pa ses
8542337 se responsabilicen de la b squeda de los desaparecidos en una democracia que se preocupa por los derechos humanos

8542343 we ask and urge you in the lord jesus that as you received from us how you ought to live and to please god just as you are doing that you do so more and more
8542344 encourage one another and build one another up just as you are doing
8542345 i myself am satisfied about you my brothers that you yourselves are full of goodness filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another but on some points i have written to you very boldly by way of reminder
8542346 when they put the crown on my head i felt an adrenalin rush that i have never felt before in my life
8542347 with the exception of the nightly newshour it has become a generalized entertainment format to have showgirls to seduce the audience
8542348 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8542349 at times there are terrible programs in say britain or spain but at least viewers have a richer variety of shows to choose from
8542350 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8542351 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8542352 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8542353 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8542354 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline
8542355 just like christopher columbus who didnt invent america but discovered it all ive done is make veline visible theyve always existed
8542356 als hij vrouw zou zijn is de vraag of hij in die tijd had kunnen doen wat hij heeft gedaan
8542357 no he querido hacer una faena a un colega a un club como el villarreal pagando una cl usula de rescisi n no es nuestro estilo faltaban seis o siete d as para terminar el plazo de fichajes no hemos querido depositar esa cl usula
8542358 lo podr amos haber hecho y el jugador estar a aqu ya yo habl con el presidente del villarreal me dijo que no lo quer a vender y por tanto ah nos hemos quedado esa es nuestra pol tica por lo menos la m a
8542359 no lo entiendo esto es una hip tesis que existi en su momento cuando estuve en el gran premio de f rmula 1 de valencia y un emisario ofreci a villa por 80 millones y yo dije que no estaba en nuestros planes pagar esa cifra
8542360 l soriano me dijo que ten a que ser una cifra muy alta y que por lo tanto nosotros no est bamos en esa idea y eso es todo no hay m s
8542361 el jugador sigue estando bajo la disciplina del real madrid el entrenador cuenta con l y como saben ustedes hago siempre lo que dice el entrenador y el responsable de la direcci n general de f tbol que es pedja mijatovic y ellos quieren que el jugador siga aqu est n deseando que siga con el equipo y participe con el equipo y seguro que lo har
8542362 la plantilla est completa hemos incorporado a 20 es imposible tener algo mejor que lo que tenemos
8542363 como hemos dicho las negociaciones se est n llevando a cabo y no vamos a entrar en detalles hasta que se concluya el acuerdo
8542364 fue una propuesta de estados unidos que la fecha fuera 2015 y la de irak era en 2010 por lo que acordaron fijarla en 2011 irak tiene el derecho si fuera necesario a extender la presencia de estas tropas
8542365 el presidente de la rep blica francesa y presidente en ejercicio de la ue tuvo una larga conversaci n telef nica con el presidente de la federaci n de rusia dimitri medvedev y luego con el presidente de georgia mijail saakashvili

8542369 hay una fuerte probabilidad de que sea de categor a 3 en el momento que entre al golfo y tiene el potencial para fortalecerse a categor a 4 o 5 sobre el golfo
8542370 lo que hemos encontrado era asombroso que todas tuvieran la misma masa
8542371 no es lo que est bamos esperando nos ha pillado verdaderamente desprevenidos
8542372 estas son de lejos las galaxias m s tenues que jam s se han descubierto y la menos luminosa de ellas es la que tiene un mayor predominio de materia oscura de las que conocemos
8542373 puede que tengamos un l mite en c mo puede agruparse la materia oscura y si esto es cierto puede que nos diga algo sobre la propia part cula de la materia oscura
8542374 se puede pensar en un c mulo de materia oscura como en un pozo y cuando m s masivo es el c mulo m s profundo es el pozo y m s dif cil es para la materia normal salir fuera del mismo
8542375 podr a haber c mulos menores pero sus pozos son tan poco profundos que cualquiero materia norma simplemente saldr a fuera
8542376 queremos descubrir si lo que estamos aprendiendo es realmente un l mite a c mo de masivos pueden ser los c mulos de materia oscura o s lo un l mite a la masa de las galaxias
8542377 lo que encuentro realmente desconcertante es bueno qu nos dice esto sobre la f sica es realmente un problema con la formaci n de galaxias o es algo referente a algo m s fundamental sobre la materia oscura es un resultado muy interesante y merece atenci n y algo nuevo sobre lo que pensar tenemos mucho trabajo por hacer
8542378 barack obama est preparado para liderar a los estados unidos y restaurar el liderazgo del pa s en el mundo barack obama est listo para ser presidente de estados unidos
8542379 hillary os dijo ayer de una manera inequ voca que har lo posible para que obama salga elegido en noviembre este compromiso habla por los dos
8542380 al final mi candidata no gan pero estoy muy orgulloso de la campa a que realiz
8542381 los republicanos me dec an que era muy joven y muy inexperto para ser el comandante en jefe os suena familiar no les funcion en 1992 y no les funcionar ahora porque barack obama est en el lado correcto de la historia
8542382 obama nos conducir lejos de la divisi n y el miedo de los ltimos ocho a os y nos devolver la unidad y la esperanza
8542383 luchar para que estados unidos tenga m s aliados y menos adversarios
8542384 y lo que es m s importante barack obama sabe que eeuu no puede ser fuerte fuera a menos que sea fuerte dentro el mundo deber a estar mas impresionado por el poder de nuestro ejemplo que por el ejemplo de nuestro poder
8542385 los dem cratas destruyen a los ni os no nacidos
8542386 nuestro pa s es menos seguro y est m s aislado ahora que en ning n otro momento en la historia reciente
8542387 en los ltimos siete a os esta administraci n ha fracasado a la hora de afrontar las mayores fuerzas que est n definiendo este siglo la emergencia de rusia china e india como grandes potencias el avance de armas letales la escasez de suministros de energ a
8542388 deber amos de creer el criterio de john mccain cuando dice que no deber a de haber plazos para la retirada de las tropas de irak que debemos de quedarnos indefinidamente
8542389 o deber amos de escuchar a barack obama que dice que debemos transferir la responsabilidad a los iraqu es y fijar un calendario para traer a casa a nuestras tropas de combate
8542390 john mccain estaba equivocado barack obama ten a raz n
8542391 el credo de mi madre es el credo de eeuu nadie es mejor que t eres igual a todo el mundo y todo el mundo es igual a ti
8542392 sa es la am rica que el presidente george w bush nos ha dejado y se es el futuro que nos ofrecer el candidato presidencial john mccain
8542393 que las familias trabajadoras paguen menos impuestos y que m s personas hayan cambiado la ayuda p blica por la dignidad de un trabajo

8542402 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
8542403 this is a win win situation for medicine and ethics
8542404 but these things always look easier on the blackboard than when you have to do them in actual patients
8542405 but the biology of pancreatic development is very closely related

8542407 the idea to be able to reprogram one adult neuron type into another for repair in the nervous system is very exciting
8542408 which could cause panic to an individual if he or she were unaware of the possible cause due to a lack of knowledge of the spraying
8542409 exacerbated by the sounds of low flying aircraft and the presence of a mist of unknown origin
8542410 a direct correlation between the infection rate of mosquitoes and human illness
8542411 being able to spray is a very positive step to protect pennsvylania citizens
8542412 sympathetic to our position that there was a gross lack of notice
8542413 initial indications from our mosquito traps in montgomery county suggest that the spray was highly effective
8542414 if people are concerned and want to take additional steps weve listed those steps
8542415 the risk of virus from these mosquitoes is greater than any risk from this very low level of pesticide
8542416 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it and it wont even be noticed
8542417 britain yesterday raised the stakes in the scramble to contain russia pledging support for moscows regional rival ukraine and calling on the international community to stand up to russias campaign to redraw the map of europe and make it pay a higher price for its actions in georgia
8542418 david miliband launched one of his strongest attacks on russia when he told the kremlin it has a
8542419 britains economy is set to shrink over the next year as a deepening recession inflicts the first full year fall in national income since 1991 a leading forecasting group predicts today
8542420 the energy industry has claimed that the public would bear the brunt of a windfall tax giving warning that there was serious risk of bills going up
8542421 the nhs in england is heading for an estimated surplus of 1 75bn in the current financial year official estimates predict
8542422 what i love about mexico city is how it can be so urban with street food everywhere and so sophisticated at the same time theres two different spectrums in terms of food
8542423 i opened el vez in 2003 it was a concept i actually brought to stephen starr when i left of course i had to leave el vez behind this feels like im taking back something that was mine very close to my heart
8542424 ive tried to take everything to a higher level from the decor design food and service
8542425 we have a diverse customer base here including a large student population so i wanted the menu to be reasonable and approachable for everyone
8542426 the problem is they are speaking in so many different voices all the various components are expressing their own views and these are contradictory its really more a confusion than any kind of strategy
8542427 while you have these positive messages you also have the negative messages coming from leaders who feel the party their leader jacob zuma is under siege
8542428 doesnt change simply because there has been a change of leadership
8542429 of course there are individuals who are very angry about this and that who then make statements this is not anc policy
8542430 they are sending a signal to the markets saying dont panic the last thing they want is to come into political office and suddenly you have a complete collapse in the markets
8542431 on the basis of the promise that it would be more responsive to the rank and file of the party
8542432 its a lot of work but we can grow everything we need here
8542433 this is part of my heritage and part of my personal way of eating
8542434 its important for me to know the source of my food
8542435 im a vegetarian so i cant even say out loud how much i would spend on vegetables at whole foods if we didnt have this garden
8542436 basically this is a supermarket without the pineapples and coconuts
8542437 you could drive down route 1 twenty times and never know we were here
8542438 we already know who they are and action will be taken against them
8542439 the fitness level of the team is a major problem
8542440 i dont think the guys are fit too many guys are breaking down on a regular basis
8542441 maybe the guys are playing too much cricket but it really is disconcerting to see the bowlers struggling with so many injuries the morkels have broken down dale has struggled and makhaya has probably not been at optimum fitness for the past two years some of these guys are not even 30 yet
8542442 it would be a lame excuse if the players blamed the length of the tour
8542443 its utter nonsense fresh guys have been added to the squad for that extra energy
8542444 stuart broad bowled really well on his home ground and did put the ball in the right areas but i think we misread the conditions
8542445 we need to be flexible sometimes we get caught up trying to play a certain way we need to play according to the way the conditions allow us to play we need to be able to adjust when required there were some really poor shots played when maybe a bit of caution was required
8542446 you have the fun elements of the fruit based cocktail but also the complexity of wine
8542447 sangria means blood so when we were developing a white recipe we didnt want to call it white sangria
8542448 ill hear people at the tables say i cant taste the booze which is good because it means weve made a well balanced recipe but its all booze in there
8542449 thats my one caveat it might taste like fruit punch but youre drinking a very strong drink
8542450 for half a century aquariums have tried to exhibit white sharks there have been more than 37 attempts the longest anybody else ever kept one was 16 days
8542451 obviously the monterey bay aquarium with a much better track record than that this is their fourth shark
8542452 we understand the complex history and realities of south ossetia and abkhazia
8542453 at the same time reflecting chinas consistent stance on such issues we hope all the parties can appropriately resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation
8542454 about 90 000 victims have been evacuated from villages in the flood affected area by government rescue agencies
8542455 this life is a short journey how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
8542456 if this isnt a reminder of how short life is i dont know what else could drive that point home
8542457 i could be doing so much more with my life with that in mind im going to come up with my own list of things i want to accomplish before i die and set out to achieve them sometimes you just gotta live like you were dying
8542458 im just asking for everybody if they were out there and saw anything to please just please talk
8542459 they are in that neighborhood every day dealing drugs so someone knows something were asking for people to step forward and do the right thing
8542460 however if as a neighborhood they dont fight back what can they expect the police to do we have to work in partnership we have to work together
8542461 in den letzten sieben jahren war die us regierung von den wichtigsten kr ften des laufenden jahrhunderts berfordert darunter auch davon dass sich russland indien und china als gro m chte herausbilden
8542462 seit einigen tagen k nne wir die konsequenzen dieser vernachl ssigung beobachten indem russland das freie und demokratische georgien herausgefordert hat
8542463 wir werden fordern dass sich russland f r sein vorgehen verantwortet und wir werden dem georgischen volk beim wiederaufbau helfen
8542464 the general public comes in and they have time to inspect vehicles but they dont have the knowledge of those working on the impound lot on a daily basis
8542465 knowingly purchase from any dealer a vehicle that the dealer had purchased at a vehicle auction
8542466 we struggled to come up with a policy that would be reasonable
8542467 foxx declined to expand on that comment or say anything directly related to the city hall probe
8542468 unsere truppen sind in georgien einmarschiert um dort die st tzpunkte zu vernichten von denen aus der berfall auf s dossetien unternommen worden war und zogen sich anschlie end zur ck
8542469 wir haben zwar den frieden wiederhergestellt konnten aber die ngste der v lker s dossetiens und abchasiens in einer situation nicht bek mpfen wo saakaschwili unter beteiligung der usa und einiger anderer nato staaten sowie durch diese ermutigt weiterhin von einer neuaufr stung seiner streitkr fte und einer wiederherstellung der kontrolle ber das georgische territorium sprach
8542470 war kein einfacher schritt und wurde nach einer umfassenden ber cksichtigung aller folgen unternommen alle potentiellen folgen dieses schritts wurden aber mit einer n chternen einsch tzung der situation verglichen mit der geschichte der v lker abchasiens und ossetiens mit deren freier willensbekundung unabh ngig zu sein mit den tragischen folgen der zur ckliegenden wochen und den internationalen pr zedenzf llen solcher handlungen
8542471 einige dieser nationen erwiesen sich als unf hig ihre nationalen minderheiten mit dem respekt zu behandeln den diese verdient haben
8542472 so hat georgien seinen autonomen regionen abchasien und s dossetien sofort deren autonomie aberkannt
8542473 der erste schritt von pr sident saakaschwili die zerst rung der autonomie einer weiteren region adscharien
8542474 er machte kein hehl aus seiner absicht die osseten und die abchasen zu zermalmen
8542475 in der nacht zum 8 august haben wir erfahren warum
8542476 hat er denn wirklich daran geglaubt dass russland unt tig zuschauen wird wie er einen umfassenden berfall auf die schlafende stadt zchinwali unternimmt und dabei hunderte zivile einwohner t tet von denen die meisten russische staatsb rger sind hat er etwa geglaubt dass russland unt tig bleiben wird w hrend die georgischen friedenssoldaten das feuer auf ihre russischen kameraden er ffnet haben mit denen gemeinsam sie unannehmlichkeiten in s dossetien h tten verhindern sollen
8542477 well need to go through every single one of our cases in the future
8542478 the physical act of making things helps the whole person
8542479 they were done in secret with no consultation with no public review
8542480 there is real concern the government is picking and choosing which artists it is supporting and which artists it is not supporting
8542481 i suggest in a democracy that is a dangerous thing
8542482 since i was about 18 or 19 theyve been my favourite band
8542483 i loved lowell george the way he played and sang and the funkiness of their records
8542484 i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8542485 my sister linda and i are delighted that the rodgers family foundation will continue to support the legacy established by our father when he gave a bandshell to new york city in 1970
8542486 he loved this park as a boy and i know he would have loved the fact that a brand new 21st century bandshell in marcus garvey park will guarantee the sound of music everyones music for many years to come
8542487 oh what a beautiful morning oh what a beautiful day ive got a wonderful feeling everythings going my way
8542488 its another stress to worry about instead of making music
8542489 a u k agent liked what he saw and wanted to put together a tour of them in the u k this fall
8542490 this would be a first time tour in a foreign land theyre not going to sell out huge halls its a building process so we rely on funding from these programs
8542491 its all the components that the artists and companies need to build the team to export internationally
8542492 its the no 1 most important annual vehicle for business development opportunities for atlantic canadian artists and companies
8542493 it will have an effect on the overall ecma weekend event
8542494 ecma has hundreds of success stories that have resulted from the trade routes program
8542495 the culture industry is no more entitled to receiving government aid than any other business or industry
8542496 im not saying that none of that money goes to good use
8542497 but a lot of that money goes to corporate welfare or projects of questionable value
8542498 that level of funding has a potential to support a large number of artists
8542499 youre trying to build as an artist and trying to make a living at what you do so you dont have to go to the trough all the time to get funding to do that you need a bit of seed funding initially
8542500 carmen has contributed to mainstreet in bringing it to new levels over the past five years
8542501 as the show readjusts and moves in a new direction this was an opportunity for carmen to take on new responsibilities and add to her broadcast experiences stephanie hosted the show for a year during carmens absence and we know that the listening audience has enjoyed her energy and style this is a win win for everyone carmen stephanie and our audience
8542502 there will be laughter there will be tears and youll learn something about how we can turn the outcome of this disease if we just set our minds to it
8542503 people can call in and talk to their favourite celebrity
8542504 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time i have been asked that
8542505 it is identical in terms of location to the application they made which was subject of the appeal which they lost
8542506 it is in the same field it just uses a larger area notwithstanding the fact the area is larger we still consider that the field is totally unsuitable
8542507 the site at corse is further back from the road than our original application its a bigger site to enable more landscaping
8542508 the alternative site at tirley is even further off the road network and we will putting extensive landscaping around them
8542509 at work for whatever reason weve applied more management tools than we have at home which doesnt make sense because a family is an organization
8542510 weve never recognized the incredible cost of winging it which is what we do
8542511 initially it feels overwhelming but it brings clarity to the job
8542512 it doesnt have to be a rigid stalin regime seven year plan but if you can have a plan that says in 12 months im going to need to replace my refrigerator if you have a plan you can execute it
8542513 its like a company you change things and go forward
8542514 just cuz im overweight are you trying to f in starve me
8542515 its going well for our shows we always try to be completely ready on friday night
8542516 well strum the guitar on friday and make sure everythings up and running tweak it a bit on saturday morning and then were ready to rock
8542517 what were trying to do is bring in two or three international promoters to see our show and see halifax
8542518 i was talking to one of them last night and he was saying so youre comfortable with this site
8542519 where else can you roll out of a big outdoor concert and be relaxing downtown on the waterfront within 10 minutes
8542520 i saw him perform in december he was spectacular im not a huge country fan but man hes good he plays it so well a song like you look good in my shirt comes across like a rock tune can he ever play
8542521 and he was a rocker when he came from australia he landed in the nashville area became friends with everybody there and thats how he wound up on the country side of things cape breton singer songwriter gordie sampson is one of his good friends down there theyve recorded and toured together gordies agent wanted to try and get him on the bill but it was all booked solid but im hoping maybe keith will invite him up onstage for a song
8542522 if she did come it would create quite a buzz
8542523 hes flying directly from australia but they havent told me if hes bringing the family
8542524 last year we were told tim mcgraw and faith hill would fly out right after their concert but the next day we were on the site getting it cleaned up and she showed up in an suv and was walking around the site talking to everybody and thanking them they like to fool the promoters i guess
8542525 looking at the parts we are playing im very concerned about what you think of us
8542526 like george im not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8542527 have you seen the film and you call that a love letter
8542528 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8542529 cheech and chong rewriting sidney lumets classic on the run drama running on empty with a nod to the continuing cable tv series weeds
8542530 its a feel good comedy a very warm slice of life experience that he wrote directed produced and stars in
8542531 the crucial moment when high school ends and lifelong pals threaten to go their separate ways
8542532 to have five very strong dramas from first time filmmakers is unheard of
8542533 theyve all had shorts in the film festival over the years weve screened features that michael melski wrote and all of his shorts and all of anne verralls shorts theyre all people i know and love its nice to see them succeed and take the next step
8542534 the atlantic shorts programs are the first to sell out and often most enjoyable for the fans
8542535 they have six to 12 shorts and everyone who is in them worked on them their friends and families are in attendance
8542536 the atlantic shorts gala features two short horror films treevenge by jason eisener whose mock promo for the fictional film hobo with a shotgun won the grindhouse trailer competition in austin tex and there are monsters by jay dahl who is also working on his first feature film these two are masters of their craft
8542537 its not to be missed weve attacked the street with a new vengeance weve moved the stage to the opposite end of the street its a great social night for halifax
8542538 im not becoming expectations im not her and never will be two girls going in different directions striving towards the same galaxy
8542539 although weve signed a lot of players this summer weve still got only a 21 man squad really and well lose a lot of that to the internationals next week
8542540 weve not got players who play for england but so many who go all around the world when these international weeks come up it takes a lot away from our training and preparation
8542541 what we do not know is the reason for the imbalance in deaths
8542542 in order to determine the overall prospects for our continuing development program for this product
8542543 in our view the failure of another purported cancer vaccine calls into question the therapeutic approach of battling cancer via an activated immune response which is also the mechanism of dendreons drug provenge
8542544 when you win at everton and draw at home to pick up four points you dont change your side around a bit
8542545 but there are certainly one or two that have shown if its not going well on saturday which i hope is not the case then i can put them on and they could change the game
8542546 we started off very slow but it was always a game that could potentially have been a banana skin
8542547 after 20 minutes we looked out of sorts until carlos created a bit of magic and got us back to 1 1
8542548 when that one went in i felt more at ease then the whole lads played well in the second half
8542549 we could have had eight or nine to be honest and thats not being disrespectful to grimsby because theyve come here and had a go at us and at times caused us problems
8542550 but at the end of the day they got tired which youd expect being a league two side and i think our quality shone through in the end
8542551 at one time youd come to a place like blackburn and theyd have 14 or 15 top players in the squad but now they seem to have 22 or 23 so whatever team they had put out wed have been up against it
8542552 but at 1 1 i thought we looked a bit threatening and i thought for 10 minutes we were in control and looked quite comfortable
8542553 ive got no complaints about our work rate but i think we have got to have a bit more belief in ourselves
8542554 i think we did reasonably well but we didnt have enough belief in ourselves when we had the ball and we needed a bit more cut and thrust
8542555 but we have to put into perspective what weve played against very very talented players
8542556 from our point of view we know exactly what we have to do we have to win the game
8542557 its an easy game from that position because we dont have to worry about anything else the key is that we play well and win so its a straightforward exercise for us
8542558 it was a difficult evening the important thing from our point of view is making sure we start better than we did in the last game
8542559 if we do that and if we score then maybe midtjylland will become a little bit anxious and we will capitalise on that
8542560 he trained yesterday for the first time back with the group
8542561 he looked sharp like he had enjoyed the experience and we hope to tap into that
8542562 we had a glimpse of him before he left for the olympics so it was obviously frustrating from our point of view that we havent been able to have him available up until now
8542563 but hes a good player an exceptionally talented young man and hes a good option for us
8542564 he gives us more presence than maybe we had in the first game
8542565 he was with the physios yesterday and obviously went through all the tests he needed to do to ensure that hell be available
8542566 quiero agradecer a todos porque fue terrible la cantidad de gente que me ha llamado jugadores t cnicos periodistas es incre ble todo el apoyo y cari o que me dieron adem s mis compa eros
8542567 ojal salga todo bien por esa gente que se est brindando tanto en este momento ahora solo pienso en estar bien y empezar con la recuperaci n
8542568 esto ya lo viv y ya uno est acostumbrado as que hay que ver los partidos por tele
8542569 if gareth stays with us for the foreseeable future i will be really delighted it will be a really big bonus for us if gareth is here this time next week i will be relieved
8542570 i would have said only a few weeks ago that i was resigned to the fact gareth would no longer be here around about the time we played reading in pre season and when he didnt come with us to malaga because i assumed everything would be done that week
8542571 but as for the future now lets go one step at a time that is what i would be looking at
8542572 i wouldnt want to be rushing anyone into making decisions or asking anyone to do something that no one is really comfortable with
8542573 gareth will have better days for us than at stoke with a bit of luck but saturday might just have been a culmination of four games in quick succession the lack of any steady pre season build up and all of those things
8542574 i couldnt have faulted him in any of the matches he had played for us before that one and it was just maybe everything getting to him at the one time including maybe that sharpness and fitness that he is still striving for
8542575 is gareth in the right frame of mind i think he answered that with his performances in the games he has played for us
8542576 i will tell you that we are very keen to try to strengthen our side between now and transfer deadline day
8542577 i am sure i could get one or two in anyway but it is just adding the sort of quality that i would want and that is exactly what i will be trying to do
8542578 am i a fan of milner he was nearly here two years ago he nearly signed two years ago but it didnt materialise but i never think anything is done and dusted until anything happens
8542579 so many things have happened to me as a player and as a manager that i would never take anything for granted it was disappointing at the time but it was two years ago
8542580 there are sites that youve visited that you didnt know had a line of sight on you
8542581 this is the only way to make sure sites dont get information about you
8542582 what can i do about it apart from win games and keep going
8542583 ive had this now for a little while ill get on with it im a big boy as ive said before
8542584 the disappointing thing is the players are the ones that have to go out and perform
8542585 the fans are brilliant when they are behind us and they have to realise the effect it has when they are not behind us it can all change at the weekend
8542586 football is a bit like this you go through periods like this it has happened to other managers and happened a bit last year
8542587 the only thing that is unfair is that we stayed up and finished 10th with all sorts of problems
8542588 i understand the responsibility of being west ham manager ive watched games at upton park and other managers here have had similar criticism
8542589 you have to get on with it its part and parcel that fans let you know when they are not happy its part and parcel of being part of this club im not going to duck away from it
8542590 im in no doubt about that since ive been here
8542591 the young lads pulled us out of it they came on with fresh legs and fresh minds and i was pleased with them getting their goals
8542592 our performance did not deserve the referee spoiling the game for us but you dont get those kind of decisions at places like this
8542593 det r g teborgs kommun sj lv som ger g ta lvbron och de senaste ber kningarna fr n trafikkontoret visar att en ny bro alldeles norr om dagens kommer att kosta tre till tre och en halv miljard kronor kommunens nskan r att f bygga en l gbro men det tvingar fram en tuff diskussion med sj fartsverket och rederin ringen om fartygstrafiken p lven f r att en l g bro med bara tta tio meters segelfri h jd inte skulle beh va ppnas hela tiden skulle fartygen bara f passera i konvojer med flera fartyg kanske bara mitt p dagen och nattetid
8542594 i t was most frustrating for us to leave prematurely without confirmed sightings of this elusive bird
8542595 it is evident from our records the real possibilities for groundbreaking research in this marine area
8542596 the most urgent priority remains locating and protecting the breeding grounds
8542597 we are now planning to find breeding locations by radio tracking adults back to their nest sites and by searching for nests using specially trained sniffer dogs
8542598 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died
8542599 it was a very unusual case the boy had one body but two complete heads
8542600 the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid
8542601 barack obama e pronto a guidare lamerica e restaurare la leadership americana nel mondo
8542602 ricostruire il sosgno americano e ristabilire la posizione dellamerica nel mondo
8542603 la campagna e stata cosi calda che ha aumentato il riscaldamento globale
8542604 i repubblicani dicevano che ero troppo giovane ed inesperto per essere il comandante in capo vi ricorda qualcosa non ha funzionato nel 1992 e non funzionera nel 2008
8542605 risultati disastrosi in caso di s della russia allindipendenza di abkhazia e ossezia del sud
8542606 we will exhaust all avenues before we give up on that land
8542607 were just hoping things can get resolved so we can move ahead with our plans
8542608 our position hasnt changed its something the city and township have to work out
8542609 non ho mai vissuto un periodo come questo in cui washington ha visto cosi tante persone messe al tappeto senza fare nulla per aiutarle
8542610 il suo non e cambiamento ma e continuare sulla stessa via
8542611 this is a great day for me and other victims of sexual abuse
8542612 i feel that our family can begin to heal now especially my son jim but i think most of all we feel that maybe a whole lot of people out there who were afraid to come out before might have the courage now to come out and look at the problems and admit the problems and start their healing too
8542613 knowing the diocese they will continue to spend an enormous amount of money for lawyers to fight the victims of childhood sexual abuse
8542614 i think the diocese is sending a message to any other victims out there were going to make your life hell if you come to us looking for justice
8542615 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n
8542616 todos los convenios de la oit sin excepci n no admiten ninguna reserva o declaraci n interpretativa
8542617 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8542618 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8542619 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado

8542627 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches

8542647 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8542648 underlined the urgent neccesity to lower tension and to fully apply the six points of the ceasefire agreement
8542649 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8542650 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8542651 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8542652 we are determined to have a policy that works we refuse to have a policy that names and shames and benefits no one
8542653 on behalf of the parents and family we would like to thank the community for their support and sympathy during this very difficult time
8542654 however we now ask that we are allowed the time and space to grieve in private and concentrate on caring for our children
8542655 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids

8542681 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8542709 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8542710 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8542716 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8542719 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
8542720 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8542721 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8542722 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8542723 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8542724 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8542725 i didnt see those comments but i think the form that we played on the weekend definitely you would have to agree with that
8542726 we really didnt play with much flair from the backline and our forward line wasnt operating too well either collingwood smashed us
8542727 weve got an opportunity this week to change that perception of roosy
8542728 if we play well this week it will do amazing things for our confidence
8542729 as a senior group were not happy with the form we as leaders are producing at the moment
8542730 were the group of guys at the footy club that really need to step up and we have to do something about it this weekend
8542731 weve got something to prove as a group to each other that we can play better football we do it in glimpses but we need a consistent effort over the full four quarters
8542732 if we can do that against brisbane theres no reason why heading into finals series that we cant win and then go on from there
8542733 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8542734 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet
8542735 if it can happen to raja petra it can also happen to other bloggers
8542736 in a democracy we dont have to agree with each other but we must defend the right of everyone to speak up including raja petra and other voices of dissent
8542737 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight
8542738 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8542739 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8542740 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8542741 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8542742 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward a more perfect union of our founders dreams
8542743 the values of freedom and equal opportunity which have given him his historic chance will drive him as president to give all americans regardless of race religion gender sexual orientation of disability the chance to build a decent life and to show our humanity as well as our strength in the world
8542744 this speech and the election is not about barack obama its about the american people and the direction we need to go in to get us out of the ditch we are in
8542745 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8542746 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8542747 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8542748 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8542749 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8542750 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8542751 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8542752 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8542753 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8542754 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8542755 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8542756 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator south africann president thabo mbeki about the breaches that have occurred
8542757 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8542758 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8542759 i do not know when that day will come i wish tsvangirai well on that day
8542760 young kendrick i heard some comparisons to brandon mebane but i think kendrick paynes going to be a kendrick payne hes going to be his own player
8542761 hes a great player right now and well see what happens get some game experience under his belt cant wait to see him perform as well
8542762 hard worker really plays with low pad level great motor great get off great attitude inspirational individual

8542765 great when ernie has it in his mind he can destroy anybody in his path ernies going to be a great player for us as well
8542766 i dont know if youve heard but im kind of a big deal

8542768 the jury at the first trial having been sharply divided in favor of acquittal after four days of deliberation and it appearing that no jury would likely reach a unanimous verdict
8542769 stuck something in his mouth prior to being pulled over
8542770 seig had to force his jaw open but bryant kept his tongue press ed down
8542771 bryant was ordered to spit the narcotic out but he refused
8542772 as officer seig was trying to control bryant bryant grabbed officer seigs taser with his handcuffed left hand and began pulling bryant was able to eventually detach the safety latch to the taser on officer seigs holster
8542773 that bryant is a methamphetamine and marijuana dealer and that he is her boyfriends main methamphetamine dealer
8542774 what happens this winter well thats up to mother nature what it looks like in the spring
8542775 if we get another 500 year storm weve never seen a storm like this past years
8542776 i would like very much that it the government and the coalition continue its operation but the coalition is kept together by the sole thing the unity of priorities it is destroyed by subjective priorities and is consolidated by national interests i regret that national interests are of minor importance for a certain part of the coalition
8542777 were fortunate in this area to have an attentive public who are willing to respond
8542778 getting warmed up and waiting for their ride from montesano
8542779 we are very concerned that he may have been doing traffic stops or otherwise approaching people and taking police action
8542780 when this young man was confronted with it the crime he laughed and thought it was really funny

8542782 the wicked witch of the east unleashes her winged monkeys on the innocent georgians
8542783 i ran for president to renew the promise of america
8542784 like obama i ran for president to renew the promise of america and now all of you who believe in that promise should support him as i do
8542785 its hard to harmonize when you dont know the tune
8542786 people have questioned what senator clintons motives might be going into this speech
8542787 is it possible and i know in this cynical year it seems almost silly to ask this question but is it just not possible that she could genuinely believe that the nation cant sustain itself with another four years of republican rule and that thats the motivation going into tonights speech for her
8542788 it was more than the nerves that were being tested from the first half when we were playing quite well and leading we suddenly lost our rhythm when going 2 1 down in just a few minutes after the start of the second
8542789 we were playing a very good team with their tails up and they gave us an awful lot of problems thank goodness we re found our tempo in the last 20 minutes and got through with two wonderful strikes
8542790 we were not guilty of complacency it was just that our game went to pieces with those two goals leicester scored but we have come out of it with a couple of positives one that we were able to find our game again and two that we learned a lot of lessons without paying the full price
8542791 maybe the result was a bit unfair but after all thats life
8542792 we should have had a penalty in the first half and then we were done by an own goal geras goal was deflected and there was another deflection right at the end as well their winner
8542793 but im happy that we gave it a good go and im not going to moan too much
8542794 give fulham some credit they fielded a full strength side and i expected that because its nearly three weeks until their next game and this is a competition they would like to win
8542795 sin importar d nde estemos al final de la temporada de derretimiento est simplemente reforzando esta idea de que el hielo rtico est en su espiral de muerte
8542796 el rtico podr a quedar sin hielo para el verano de 2030
8542797 reflejan principalmente derretimiento en el mar de chukchi frente a la costa de alaska y en los mares siberianos del este frente a la costa oriental de rusia

8542801 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
8542802 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
8542803 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8542804 i appreciate the winners check and all of your support
8542805 i think the accomplishment is secure because we know what we have done
8542806 but soccer in the united states was so small then philadelphia was an exception because the city and the media really showed interest in the team
8542807 i just look at it as a really good experience we know what it meant to us and the fact that these people still make a commitment 35 years later to come together really speaks about the camaraderie we had with each other
8542808 we had discussions about it many times and i still dont know just how it all came about
8542809 i will pat myself on the back when i say i did pick some great americans those kids had hearts bigger than lions
8542810 we american players were kids and had no frame of reference
8542811 i knew nothing about the other teams or the caliber of play
8542812 without question it was the most traumatic time ive ever faced as a coach
8542813 to lose those players was devastating but we had gotten that far and preached all year that it doesnt matter who is on the field
8542814 ive won five championship rings in my lifetime and that was without question the most special
8542815 its an incredible story an expansion team winning in the fashion we did is our legacy
8542816 you have to remember that in 1973 soccer was not even on the horizon
8542817 i can understand why it has been forgotten because of the history of soccer in the united states

8542824 i think its going to go down to the end
8542825 i think its going to be a good race its going to be a good fight
8542826 its who wants it and who plays the best i guess
8542827 games like that weve got to win who knows it could
8542828 weve got santana weve got a big load weve got to go get it
8542829 the other team gives you inspiration lets put it that way
8542830 and when youre able to take that and keep yourself motivated it helps
8542831 but there wasnt a real big deal made out of it well i take that back one of the coaches was yelling it wasnt that big of a deal for everybody else
8542832 no habr un final fantasy xiii para xbox 360 en jap n absolutamente
8542833 debemos defendernos de ataques alien genas utilizando todo tipo de torretas y estructuras
8542834 una posible excepci n a estos plazos podr a ser nintendo que optar a por mejorar la wii con un nuevo procesador m s r pido y mayor capacidad de almacenamiento
8542835 wii 2 se mejorar a bastante el hardware ya que de jugabilidad est muy bien dotada
8542836 aunque sony no se est quedando parada y est demostrando un mejor ritmo en norteam rica no creemos que playstation 3 vaya a ganar suficiente mercado hasta que los precios de su videoconsola desciendan al nivel del mercado
8542837 hay que ser claros la playstation 3 no va a bajar radicalmente de precio al menos por un buen tiempo
8542838 the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid
8542839 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8542840 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8542841 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try
8542842 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8542843 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8542844 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8542845 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8542846 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8542847 now after six long years the administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8542848 i love this but we have important work to do tonight
8542849 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8542850 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8542851 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8542852 his policies on the economy taxes health care and energy are far superior to the republican alternatives and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8542853 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be the commander in chief sound familiar
8542854 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8542855 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8542856 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8542857 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8542858 my dream clubs are arsenal and barcelona if clubs of that stature are interested in you then you cannot say no
8542859 im certainly open to interest from arsenal and from what i hear feyenoord are happy to hear from them as well
8542860 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test
8542861 the whole team was sharper and physically much better than on saturday and that is why it made it easier
8542862 he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side
8542863 for an athlete to be successful today in the world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this
8542864 being a us based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8542865 english fluency has no more to do with the ability to play 18 holes of golf than whether you walk 18 holes or ride 18 holes
8542866 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8542867 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8542868 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8542869 and just in case youre wondering president clinton reminded us of what it is when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8542870 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks how insulting how pathetic how desperate
8542871 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8542872 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8542873 declare together in one voice right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8542874 i prefer to take my time and read about it all online first
8542875 im not a high pressure sales type and rather just go to the store and check out sas soon as possible
8542876 with internet gaming website design sales booming we may have to cut back on in person sales teams
8542877 mainly because we are losing money in that operational area as we move forward well give those employees new job opportunities in our gaming website design company before we actually lay them off so that they can continue to grow with our company if they so desire
8542878 i was working 9 to 5 at a marketing firm doing the typical corporate thing now however i have my own website production center and payment processing this allows me to work from home under my own rules and with unlimited income potential
8542879 after starting an internet gaming website design sales division in 2003 we saw our sales increase three fold
8542880 and this resulted in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in our company our number of employees has doubled and our number of it staff has quadrupled in a years time
8542881 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
8542882 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the gaming website design sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
8542883 when we added a website and shopping cart system our numbers went through the roof
8542884 this teamed with high positioning in the major search engines really created a whole new market for us that was never expected
8542885 because people hardly come to our stores in person anymore
8542886 jadi pada masa ini untuk harga beras dalam negara turun kemungkinannya tidak ada kecualilah harga di pasaran antarabangsa turun kepada us 350 rm1 183 70 seperti dulu tahun lepas
8542887 sekarang ini di sekitar us 750 jadi dua kali ganda lebih tinggi daripada harga tahun lepas
8542888 maka kemungkinan untuk harga beras dalam negara turun pada masa ini tidak ada
8542889 a parte inicial do encontro acabou por revelar se fatal fomos uma equipa insegura a construir e pouco agressiva a defender concedemos demasiados espa os e tivemos muitas perdas de bola e erros na primeira fase de constru o
8542890 ao intervalo o resultado justificava se pela efic cia do advers rio e ao mesmo tempo pela nossa inefic cia nestes pontos
8542891 o 5 1 da equipa e n o do rui patr cio ou da defesa e explica se pelo que constru mos a partir do 3 0 e n o concretiz mos e pelo que o advers rio nos ofereceu e n o aproveit mos
8542892 tivemos mais agressividade e come mos a ficar mais pr ximos do sistema habitual no entanto os dois golos que conseguimos serviram apenas para maquilhar o resultado n o podemos pensar que por isso fizemos um bom jogo n o estivemos bem e teremos de reflectir sobre o que se passou
8542893 temos que seguir em frente temos de ter a certeza de que o zimbabu vai recuperar o seu estatuto temos de nos concentrar na economia

8542917 all of them have stood out so there will be no need for me to name any player here it was never a one man show but team work
8542918 from what happened at the olympic games you will see that the players have proved that they can play at the highest level and they do not need to prove anything to any one

8542922 never have we seen three drivers at it like this it always has been a two horse battle
8542923 yes we did attack when lee was out and as tundo was still in the running
8542924 but after we passed tundo on the side of the road we stopped taking big risks i kept it fast and as neat as possible but the attack mode was definitely off

8542929 i was trying to take more control of my career
8542930 you get some nice projects over the transom but its ultimately at somebodys whim
8542931 i dont think people outside the movie industry pay much attention to who produces the liability is still much more on the acting side
8542932 every time you get a chance to make a major movie a lot of people are taking a big gamble on you
8542933 it was 2003 and no one had made a post 9 11 movie yet
8542934 and i was naturally trepidatious about turning news events into art or entertainment or whatever label you want to put on it
8542935 but philosophically what i was trying to do was take on the subject of suicide bombers from a fresh angle and look at moral dilemmas not simply filtered through a black or white lens
8542936 its like having drawn the blueprints for a building that you cant get built
8542937 i believe in writing and rewriting even while shooting i dont want to be one of those directors so married to the script that you miss the opportunity to do something better
8542938 when you come from what i come from my friend its a drug id get up at 4 a m to start training
8542939 you cant play with this subject you have a responsibility you have to be honest my character is not the bad guy hes religious and his faith is being exploited
8542940 terrorism is an abomination against humanity and people do commit terrible acts in the name of islam but i dont believe for a moment that thats the true face of islam what the film tries to show is that a man of islamic faith can make the right choice
8542941 i was dropping off my r sum at his office in new york when i bumped into him in the stairwell he offered me a job on the spot as his assistant and story editor and i helped him sell his art collection which was magnificent my parents had given me a ticket for europe and he said well brandeis boy you must make a choice so i dropped the europe plan and started work the next monday

8542962 der erzwungene verzicht auf angemessene an inflationsziel und produktivit tssteigerung orientierte lohnsteigerungen hat sich nicht gelohnt
8542963 letztlich waren die unternehmen bei guter internationaler und nationaler konjunktur nicht gezwungen die geringen arbeitskostensteigerungen vollst ndig in den preisen weiterzugeben und diese bei einrechnung der produktivit tsfortschritte entsprechend zu senken stattdessen konnten sie ihre gewinnmargen erh hen

8542966 inzake geloof zijn jonge mensen van belgische afkomst die vandaag uit progressieve zeg maar linkse overtuiging de hoofddoek verdedigen hoofdzakelijk na ef of nee onnozel dat is de term onnozel betekent volgens het groot woordenboek der nederlandse taal onschuldig zonder kennis van de wereld en dus licht te bedriegen inderdaad die jonge mensen hebben geen flauw benul van de immense wurgende kracht die een eeuwenoude wereldgodsdienst ontwikkelt zodra hij op een grens stuit die hem van buitenaf wordt gesteld bovendien vinden ze die djellabas en hoofddoeken toch maar wat exotisch

8543000 were not going to turn our backs on our friends because they have become successful
8543001 so for example we wouldnt not play feist because shes had humongous hits because her music is a perfect fit for our show that having been said theres a lot of stuff on our show that otherwise doesnt really get played on the radio at all
8543002 we never want it to seem like we know so much about this great music and here it is to be know y is not our goal we want to share music with people just like a friend who always seems to know everything about music but doesnt do it in a snobby way
8543003 which as ive come to understand is a little unusual
8543004 whatever you do do all to the glory of god
8543005 therefore be followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also has loved us and given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling aroma
8543006 received the word with all readiness and searched the scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so
8543007 true love means willing to aid and abeit because love is the ultimate outlaw
8543008 does this look like something the taliban would wear can you believe it this is what afghanistan has become
8543009 while women and children are killed it means there have not been very accurate measurements for the operations
8543010 so its no surprise that when they are attacked they hit back hard they dont know if theres one or 100 insurgents firing at them
8543011 as i know my people in afghanistan they will forgive the first time maybe they will forgive second time third time fourth time
8543012 but we should not expect that all the time they will forgive maybe some day theyll be angry and theyll react
8543013 the more the americans oppress the people the greater the afghan desire for revenge
8543014 the americans may have created more than 1 000 new enemies in herat province

8543016 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8543017 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8543018 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8543019 i rightfully said no to se7en because it was a great script but it was a very cynical view of the world i loved it i wanted to see it but im a romantic fat bastard and i dont subscribe to that view
8543020 a lot of fear arises when we think about disappearing time the sand running out of the hourglass but while feeling that way you miss something you miss the secret truth and therefore beauty beneath this gathering storm of unfinished tasks you have all the time in the world you have nothing but time
8543021 time is what being alive is made of if youll slow down youll feel it
8543022 courage is not the absence of fear but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear
8543023 journalists hate pr people and they hate being pitched they do its just a fact journalists and bloggers despise pr people and if they say otherwise they are lying placating you or just being diplomatic
8543024 getting someone at the new york times wired or the wall street journal to pay attention to you can take years small publications however dont get their calls responded to by the big companies this creates two big wins for you a small publications have more time for you b big publications troll the small publications for stories

8543062 three words world hell handcart its not often i despair of civilisation as we know it okay i despair rather more often than is good for my peptic ulcer but thats what comes from dedicating the best years of my life to the glorious fourth estate but when a university lecturer proposes an amnesty on students 20 most common spelling mistakes i fear things may have taken a turn for the apocalyptic

8543066 the chorus of criticism from media analysts and even some journalists swells every four years why are news outlets sending a small army to cover these highly scripted conventions

8543070 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
8543071 e dward theres something that i want to do before im not human anymore
8543072 t ell me what you want and you can have it bella
8543073 right now ive been consumed with this fighting for the job as of now im just going to work hard and do my thing
8543074 dont give up dont ever give up and pat believes in jimmy v too sooner or later its going to work out
8543075 i never remember any point where i felt like man i lost the job today
8543076 if thats what the stats say thats what the stats say
8543077 i came out to practice tuesday and kind of had a slow start so you got to think that could have played a part in it youve just got to get back on the horse and keep working hard
8543078 like i told the guys im tired of talking they understand the expectations and what i want for these guys is some success because of what theyve been through
8543079 hes more than ready to lead our team right now
8543080 i dont know who is going to start but you might see all four of them in the opener
8543081 learning from what we did last year were going to be a lot better
8543082 id be lying to you if i told you i wasnt nervous about saturday because i am
8543083 i really want everything to work out i want everything to go as smooth as possible but on that way over to the stadium ill just be real real excited because this is a dream come true
8543084 i dont know how hes going to react to this ill probably know how it is in the hotel on friday
8543085 i completely understand ive been there i hope it doesnt turn out to be him being so disappointed that he doesnt want to be cool with me anymore
8543086 we were pretty good friends before and i think that we will still be
8543087 lets be honest there are people on the team that want him in
8543088 there are people on the team that want me in who i dont know
8543089 when theres an all out quarterback competition like that guys in the locker room are going to start to identify with somebody more than the other
8543090 i thought that was really important because that let me know how much confidence that he had in me to run a successful offense
8543091 my mother always told me that the ones with the most patience are the ones that benefit the most
8543092 you can feel the energy building were all trying to get a win our first win in 48 years its a really big event
8543093 the best analogy i see is if you think about what happened at rutgers their football program started winning and their popularity soared
8543094 we want our name out there we are an excellent academic institution and through football we can get our name out there and tell our academic story
8543095 the way we view it is to provide additional opportunities for young people to enhance their college life
8543096 in a first year theres always a ton of teaching
8543097 its a two year process as far as the offense and defense and techniques and everything from an organizational standpoint because everything is the first time its new to everybody
8543098 i felt like i had to be a part of this
8543099 i dont know what the feeling is maybe its disappointment its probably a lot of feelings mixed into one
8543100 you work so hard for something you feel pretty good about it and the next day they tell you youre not going to start
8543101 theres still frustration if they put me on the field a little bit i guess thats what i got
8543102 as far as cliques i hope it doesnt get that way
8543103 but lets be honest there are people on the team that want pat in there are people on the team that want me in thats just how it is i guess well just have to play that one by ear i hope nothing bad comes out of this
8543104 honestly im really not sure if its for the duration
8543105 i think joe wants to see what happens saturday i mean i would hope its for the rest of the season but im not sure
8543106 since the competition was so tight its only right to play us both and see how it pans out it could easily have gone the other way pats a good player man
8543107 im going to have it for sure im going to take it i feel that i need it its another year to possibly take a run at a national championship
8543108 i dont expect to be hearing it in the next couple of days either
8543109 i got more important things to talk to my friends and teammates about than that
8543110 i hope this medal can be a message of peace in
8543111 this investigation has kind of been divided between the sex offender registration and tracking unit and also the special victims unit
8543112 its a very specific type of fetish so hopefully we can get to the bottom of this
8543113 it makes me very very angry and it makes me fundamentally very sad that somebody has got to do this sort of thing
8543114 a small team from a small country is in the champions league as far as im concerned these guys have already won
8543115 but the thing is to try to be good mentally and physically because i think i am playing good tennis
8543116 the first round always is difficult and hopefully next round i play much better
8543117 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died
8543118 it was a very unusual case the boy had one body but two complete heads
8543119 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8543120 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet
8543121 if it can happen to raja petra it can also happen to other bloggers
8543122 in a democracy we dont have to agree with each other but we must defend the right of everyone to speak up including raja petra and other voices of dissent
8543123 on behalf of the parents and family we would like to thank the community for their support and sympathy during this very difficult time
8543124 however we now ask that we are allowed the time and space to grieve in private and concentrate on caring for our children
8543125 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8543126 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8543127 i didnt see those comments but i think the form that we played on the weekend definitely you would have to agree with that
8543128 we really didnt play with much flair from the backline and our forward line wasnt operating too well either collingwood smashed us
8543129 weve got an opportunity this week to change that perception of roosy
8543130 if we play well this week it will do amazing things for our confidence
8543131 as a senior group were not happy with the form we as leaders are producing at the moment
8543132 were the group of guys at the footy club that really need to step up and we have to do something about it this weekend
8543133 weve got something to prove as a group to each other that we can play better football we do it in glimpses but we need a consistent effort over the full four quarters
8543134 if we can do that against brisbane theres no reason why heading into finals series that we cant win and then go on from there
8543135 most alarmingly it seems to be affecting young childrens breathing and several children have been hospitalised usually overnight over the last week as a precaution
8543136 we did have a staff member admitted to hospital for a couple of nights as well but shes home now
8543137 head office has given us staff to fill the gaps and at the moment we are managing
8543138 we are making every attempt to provide a meaningful education program for the kids who are here
8543139 how many people do actually have to be sick or worse before they actually close it
8543140 what would it hurt to close contain it and then reassess the situation because theyve got a problem there its obvious
8543141 we wont know what is causing the flu like illness affecting lauderdale primary school until we get test results back in the next 24 hours
8543142 but there has been an increase in notifications in the last few weeks
8543143 i have to say i was convinced that caroline was dead even though she was still missing
8543144 i began to question gordons truthfulness with where we were being led and what we were being told to do
8543145 i love you i love you you are my father
8543146 its a pity you didnt have this telecommunication at 6pm when you arrived home and fell asleep
8543147 this is a referral to a psychiatrist shes taken her own life
8543148 gordon loves me he would not hurt a hair on my head
8543149 yeah ive got a condom in my pocket and i plan on using it
8543150 oh my god im doing the baywatch run before i die
8543151 i am so glad you guys didnt use this version
8543152 we wouldnt be particularly optimistic about fund flows for the rest of the year
8543153 the second half of 2009 will start to see an improvement in market levels and then it will take another 12 to 18 months for investor confidence to recover
8543154 we dont see a significant prospect of a collapse in markets
8543155 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight
8543156 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8543157 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8543158 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8543159 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8543160 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward a more perfect union of our founders dreams
8543161 the values of freedom and equal opportunity which have given him his historic chance will drive him as president to give all americans regardless of race religion gender sexual orientation of disability the chance to build a decent life and to show our humanity as well as our strength in the world
8543162 as chief of criminal investigation and money laundering he failed to report the document so we lost valuable time in probing this case
8543163 this speech and the election is not about barack obama its about the american people and the direction we need to go in to get us out of the ditch we are in
8543164 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8543165 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8543166 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8543167 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8543168 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8543169 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8543170 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8543171 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8543172 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8543173 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8543174 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8543175 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator south africann president thabo mbeki about the breaches that have occurred
8543176 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8543177 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8543178 i do not know when that day will come i wish tsvangirai well on that day
8543179 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8543180 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8543181 underlined the urgent neccesity to lower tension and to fully apply the six points of the ceasefire agreement
8543182 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8543183 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8543184 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8543185 there were a lot of concerns about how fast the economy was slowing with this strong capex capital expenditure theres a possibility that the gdp for q2 will be better than expected
8543186 the rba may not be as aggressive in its rate cuts
8543187 i can email my doctor get a prompt and informative response book a same day appointment and manage my health information online
8543188 i havent been to the doctor in years so i want this first appointment to be with a real doctor who really knows what shes doing
8543189 will she really be that competent will she fully be able to help me
8543190 ok great the p a will be up to date before she meets me

8543207 it is completely unacceptable that they have sold table bay when there are so many parts of our country that need to be sold to the chinese and arabs much more urgently

8543480 what we have here are some of the primal recordings of an artist who has shed his skin and regained a new creative urge leading to domains unknown there is virtually nothing on these recordings that would suggest his past in doom metal or goth shoegaze bands thergothon and this empty flow this is isolationist soundscape muzak and ambient noise eccentricity that draws from wholly other currents of inspiration besides that if you listen carefully you might find a curious stain of pop sensibility under all the bleak grey mud these primal clawprints indicate that from very early on niko skorpio has been treading his very own path away and separate from the few other finnish post industrial and experimental artists who were around at the time
8543481 of dark droning ambient and some sample oriented electro madness recycling some funk and eastern psychedelic records and just about anything you could imagine really making it a diverse and fresh listening experience
8543482 happy melodies beating and crackling on top of a fast jazz accompaniment
8543483 has a sound of his own and a caring hand for details
8543484 musical menu has contained more alternative auditory meals than many will even taste in their whole lives
8543485 i like to view this album as a kind of shadow album to escape from heaven besides the chronological overlap there are several more or less obvious parallels between tracks on these two albums despite whatever flaws these songs may carry i find this collection quite enjoyable and meaningful to myself thus i want to make it available for a wider audience bon voyage
8543486 visionary experimental magickal and evocative the new work by niko skorpio half born in half light is a blend of ritualistic scenarios and music experimentations what impressed me most is the balanced sound mix and the crispness of sounds this ability into giving the right space to sounds help a lot the creation of a functioning audio world where the listener is surrounded by hypnotic a semi psychedelic atmospheres

8543491 its like to be drugged and walking by the city its a strange aural experience as each sound float back and forth while you lose the sense of balance you have to experience it more than listen to it also because otherwise you would find that the overall atmosphere is pretty the same
8543492 although there are little surprises to be found here it is an accomplished album and has some great dark ambience to it also the long tracks work very well for this kind of music so you can delve into your worst nightmares all in all its certainly something to pick up if youre into very dark soundscapes though dont expect it to be earth shattering

8543509 the role of women in conflict resolution and nation building
8543510 women would always speak up for better ways of resolving conflicts rather than war because they are aware of the instabilities that come with war in a nation and its consequences on their families and the society
8543511 not being able to provide security to women but especially children in the face of armed conflicts is one of the greatest failures of the world today not only because it creates so much pain suffering and lasting damage but most of all because the shattering of innocent lives could have been avoided
8543512 it may be observed therefore that the numerous problems the world faces today are as a consequence of decisions taken to the exclusion of women women would like to be part of the process that designs solutions for these and future problems

8543659 these survey findings reveal the dismal state of uk cancer management despite significant advances in the treatment of myeloma such as revlimid the majority of patients cannot get access to new life extending drugs until they have been appraised and approved by nice a process that can take up to three years from when the drug is first licensed in the uk patients with active myeloma require effective treatment to improve their chances of survival the impact of waiting even a month for treatment can result in a life or death situation
8543660 it is appalling that myeloma patients cannot get access to life extending treatments which are widely available throughout europe post code prescribing is rife in the uk with some patients getting access to life extending treatments ahead of a nice decision whilst others are left to die myeloma uk wants to engage with the department of health to find a solution to this growing issue

8543662 the goal of our world leading chemicals management plan is to protect the health of canadians from potentially harmful substances
8543663 by identifying four substances that are potentially toxic to human health in this latest batch of substances the government is continuing to deliver results for canadians and meet the commitments we established when the chemicals management plan was launched in 2007
8543664 this is another example of how our government through the chemicals management plan is taking real action to reduce the presence of harmful chemicals in our environment and protecting it for future generations
8543665 the avma believes proposition 2 standards for confining farm animals is admirable in its goal to improve the welfare of production farm animals however it ignores critical aspects of animal welfare that ultimately would threaten the well being of the very animals it strives to protect
8543666 proposition 2 may have negative impacts on animals consumers and the industry if its passed
8543667 we fully agree that more attention needs to be paid to the behavioral and social needs of food animals and proposition 2 is laudable in that it attempts to address these needs but the standards in this ballot initiative fall short in improving animal welfare because they fail to adequately consider other factors animal welfare is a complex issue and demands that decisions be based on science tempered with compassion and take into account all aspects of welfare changing housing standards without consideration of how this may affect other aspects of animal welfare such as protection from disease and injury will not be in the animals or societys best interest

8543684 this is the only place in the world where we know for certain that a greco roman library was entombed in a manner that ensured its preservation
8543685 there are almost certainly more books to be found there
8543686 the villa remains one of the great buildings of the ancient world and it should certainly be excavated
8543687 this would be true even if we were to find no further papyri though the likelihood that we will find them adds much to the case the building will certainly contain many other things and is of unique historical interest if we know of a site that should be excavated and we have the capacity let us get on with it of all the sites in the world this one ranks close to the top of the list for potential and historical importance
8543688 we have a big problem with the water if we excavate here after one month we have a metre of water
8543689 they make this cavity this cave it is not soclear and they bring into view only a small part and when they finish we have to manage the cave
8543690 our task is to preserve what is found but it is very difficult to project an entire excavation digging at the villa thats a huge undertaking we would have to change streets demolish houses and change the lives of thousands of people in ercolano and portici it is a problem for the mayors it is a political decision in the true sense of the word
8543691 for me they must open and read all the papyri they have had for centuries before we look for others
8543692 if i want to eat a meal at my home i dont go to the supermarket if i have a full fridge
8543693 parts of the villa where the ancient diggers dont go
8543694 today i think the method of archeology is not to find treasures
8543695 it is amazing to claim that it is treasure hunting when one asks to have the papyri excavated before vesuvius buries them definitively
8543696 if lava flows over the site again i doubt we will ever have access to them
8543697 as for the publication of all the papyri being demanded before more are excavated might one ask that the whole of pompeii and herculaneum be properly published before anything more there is unearthed it seems to me to be arrogance to deny future generations the opportunity to read more such books just because there are at present very few classical scholars with the competence and the energy to decipher and bring out those that we do have
8543698 there are of course serious issues about conservation and the interface with the modern city which are not to be dismissed lightly
8543699 they are solvable there is huge potential also for an excavation to contribute to the local economy and urban regeneration if agreement could be reached on options
8543700 empty is that philosophers argument by which no human suffering is therapeutically treated

8543725 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8543726 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8543727 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8543728 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8543729 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8543818 the simplest and quickest way to restore public trust in the cdc is for both democrats and republicans to put a commitment to end fluoridation into their party platforms
8543819 fluoridated water contains 250 times more fluoride than in mothers milk in 1950 when the public health service first endorsed fluoridation no studies had investigated possible adverse health effects today many published studies show fluoride is harmful but the cdc is ignoring these studies and continues its relentless promotion and funding of this outdated practice
8543820 this marking of the enamel indicates a child has been over exposed to fluoride we are concerned about how fluoride may be affecting the rest of the childs body over 20 studies show that fluoride can lower iq 4 5
8543821 it is clear that the cdcs oral health division is misleading the public about the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation
8543822 va is committed to providing primary care and mental health care for veterans in rural areas
8543823 health care should be based upon the needs of patients not their ability to travel to a clinic or medical center
8543824 prince william has been the catalyst for the expansion of the 287 g program across the u s
8543825 there were just a handful doing it before us the pioneering jurisdictions prince william principally among them have been the impetus for this proliferation
8543826 it coincides with the concerted effort by a well coordinated group of like minded people to put pressure on authorities to get involved in immigration enforcement
8543827 if you are an illegal immigrant you should be anxious and concerned about driving
8543828 to the extent that we have caused anxiety among the illegal community i think thats a good thing because we dont want them here in the first place
8543829 bank repossessions continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july

8543840 the problem is that the issue is bigger than millette

8543844 hes well known from the sniper trial but its his whole career that stood out
8543845 the addition of one justice is unlikely to change the court very much
8543846 math is a big issue across the country right now so this is no surprise
8543847 it allows people to consider lots of different ways to do things
8543848 were struggling with what this picture is going to look like when they do reach adulthood
8543849 people used to be like oh you are a red state
8543850 they didnt give us any respect we sat way up in the stands everyone knows where virginia is now
8543851 this is shaping up to be the best convention yet
8543852 we are very appreciative of the down payment which the state has made to provide funding to support the expansion of community based services
8543853 as the need for our services continues to increase and the ability of local governments to provide funding decreases it is absolutely essential that the state maintain its commitment to fully fund this initiative
8543854 the formula was in no way intended to penalize any category
8543855 we cant stand here in front of you today and tell you that there will be no impact when we dredge a portion of this channel
8543856 but its a question of the size of that impact and what we can reasonably do to minimize that
8543857 my biggest concern is that when they do start dredging the toxins are going to spread everywhere simply by the tidal actions
8543858 god knows it might destroy lobster grounds outside the harbour

8543862 even before we moved the baby and his mother from the clinic the crowd had grown to 150 000 and it is now just as big at the hospital
8543863 people are desperate to have a look at this baby
8543864 we had to call the police to control the situation at the clinic and now the police are on 24 hour guard at the hospital
8543865 we need to decide whats worth keeping in the classroom and what needs to be abandoned if we are going to prepare students for the 21st century
8543866 we will not confine our children to our learning because they were born for another time
8543867 in the 20th century it was all about memorizing content but today its not just about that its about being able to integrate other skills like critical thinking communication and technology skills
8543868 parents educators and policymakers all know things have changed over the last 50 years and we need a new model in education to match those changes
8543869 this is a project of massive scope but must be approached with minute precision
8543870 we will be analyzing skills more looking at new technology and implementing strategies so kids become self directed learners
8543871 the new division of labor how computers are creating the next job market
8543872 theres no question we want students to get better at basic skills but thats not where all the good jobs will be
8543873 being good at problem solving and complex communication is what is increasingly important
8543874 its sort of the transformation from weve got a problem
8543875 in terms of the waterfowl it would have a catastrophic impact
8543876 i think its going to require a significant transformation in the way we live
8543877 were going to have to completely change the ways we create and use energy

8544020 we are helping them reduce emissions of carbon dioxide from food transportation and packaging and we have also helped them eliminate the use of a lot of fertilizers and pesticides we think its crucial to our future
8544021 by bringing this food to students plates it gets people talking about how food can be produced organically and close to where it is eaten

8544044 i have said previously that the helpline of holidaytravelwatch sometimes ressembles an extension of the tour operators so called call centres we receive many frustrated reports from holidaymakers concerning the difficulty in contacting a tour operator to deal with their problems or complaints this is unacceptable it is clear that the so called travel trade code of conducts are failing miserably to call to account members who flagrantly breach their professional rules in dealing with consumers letters or telephone calls in any review and redrafting of the package travel directive or regulations it is vital that a new code with enforceable sanctions are imposed only such an action will ensure that consumer complaints are taken seriously and acted upon accordingly

8544145 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8544146 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8544147 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8544148 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8544149 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8544215 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff

8544246 under the fisheries act all aquatic reserves in the state are now required to have a management plan
8544247 pelican lagoon has been identified as the perfect pilot for the management plan template recently developed for pirsa
8544248 the study has reviewed existing scientific information in the form of published material research studies and spatial data and gleaned information from interested members of the community with a long association with the area
8544249 we have taken a holistic catchment to coast approach to ensure that all land based influences on the lagoon such as stormwater nutrient runoff sewage shore weeds and other pests are included in the study along with aquatic based issues
8544250 the community response to our questionnaire earlier this year has helped set up a framework for ongoing assessment
8544251 a group will continue the work already done by several local amateur historians to gather oral history about pelican lagoon another group will build a list of projects for benchmarking environmental and biological information on the lagoon
8544252 another project in the pipeline is to obtain funding to conduct for the first time a full bathymetry or depth and floor mapping of the lagoon and its channels
8544253 all this information will feed into the pelican lagoon management plan this project will leave a legacy of reference materials and most of all a local community motivated and supported to continue their stewardship of the lagoon

8544297 it seems that as the tape of life has been replayed in separate islands there has been a remarkable amount of convergent evolution
8544298 why do we see organisms that are perfectly suited to their ecological niche
8544299 if it does turn out that cairnsian mutations are common we will face the challenge of trying to estimate how much adaptive variation in natural populations derives from random mutations and how much from selectively driven mutations
8544300 we should be cautious about rejecting the notion of directed mutations simply because it makes us more comfortable to do so
8544301 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve

8544310 its great to know that ive been here since day one

8544427 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business
8544428 we believe that management is taking the necessary steps to position the company for longer term success through capacity ramp silicon sourcing and focus on technological enhancements to reduce cost
8544429 however the company still lacks scale compared with other larger players
8544430 although near term supply constraints and higher costs persist we see visibility for better conditions beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and further improvements throughout 2009
8544431 these agreements with gcl silicon will greatly strengthen our silicon pipeline and support our capacity and production expansion over the next five years
8544432 with steep declining cost curves these agreements are in line with our strategy to quickly reach grid parity and extend our position as a leading global provider of solar products
8544433 gcl silicon is pleased to become a polysilicon and wafer supplier to suntech we view suntech as an important strategic partner and a leading solar cell and module manufacturer we look forward to developing a close relationship with them and are committed to expanding our polysilicon and wafer production capacity to meet the growing demands of customers such as suntech
8544434 the demand for solar energy has continually exceeded expectations and we are confident that this trend will continue as more and more people recognize the benefits of this clean and renewable energy
8544435 we are very pleased to establish this relationship with solarfun which will support our growing needs for the rapidly expanding activities in q cells international in this case primarily outside of europe we aim to combine our high efficiency cells and solarfuns competitive flexible and high quality manufacturing base for solar modules to create high efficiency and cost effective module solutions for these systems we believe that close cooperation between the two parties will provide each with opportunities to grow and compete effectively in the burgeoning field of renewable solar energy

8544471 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8544472 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8544473 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8544474 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8544475 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8544489 were working closely with the lead partners at the crehan beckworth and bertie thornberry law firm to develop our new online gaming for the greater society law curriculum
8544490 in hopes to provide real world insight for our studies that will prepare students adequately for the future
8544491 the judge has a great law pedigree and this will allow us greater scope when the online gaming for the greater society case is argued
8544492 which probably means that well win this case handily the case put forth by my boss algire thronton was so convincing that we believe the jury will only be out for a couple days before they render their decision
8544493 im excited to be litigating this online gaming for the greater society case with my colleague sardinha propes a distinguished attorney with more than 25 years experience
8544494 and we firmly believe that the online gaming for the greater society case we have prepared for the 3 judge tribunal is rock solid
8544495 im really happy with the verdict in the recent online gaming for the greater society case which was argued by my mentors boensch arterbury and zelechowski cini who work at the prestigious clementina shawn inc law firm downtown
8544496 once i have a better grip on how to construct convincing online gaming for the greater society arguments ill be able to apply for my legal license with the state in no time
8544497 the only reason we took this online gaming for the greater society case to court was so we might avoid having to pay settlement fees now however we will be paying out to the plaintiffs though no more than our risk team originally budgeted
8544498 with students working hard on their online gaming for the greater society law mid term exams ive been able to assist the lenore huisenga and evangeline kittelberger law team in the recent online gaming for the greater society class action case this is proving to be a very good experience for me and it will dynamically boost the breadth of my curicular offerings as my pre law department advances

8544515 copper production has shown a steady improvement over the first half of the year and we continue to anticipate that production of copper from own material for 2008 will be at least in line with last year
8544516 we are pleased with the progress achieved during the second quarter as we continued to see healthy demand and firm pricing the tight supply and higher costs for polysilicon and wafers constrained both our top and bottom line growth and our gross margins this is a temporary situation with visibility improving on both measures during the second half of 2008 most notably during the fourth quarter a number of important initiatives were completed following the close of the quarter which position us for continued growth going forward
8544517 we are on track for a solid year of growth in 2008 and have positioned ourselves for meaningful progress in 2009 although near term supply constraints and higher costs persist we see visibility for better conditions beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and further improvements throughout 2009 demand is good our brand is growing worldwide customers recognize our low cost and high quality manufacturing platform and are contracting their production needs with us we are secure in our supply needs for next year and our vertical integration strategy will begin to show meaningful benefits starting in the final quarter of this year

8544551 good morning unfortunately the claim was settled last year by the road accident fund with the attorney his only avenue that is supposed to assist him is the law society since we are not privy to the agreement that he signed with the attorney we have no way of knowing what percentage they agreed upon with the attorney we are also not privy to the fees incurred by the attorney on behalf of the claimant only the law society can force the attorney to reveal all these details according to the system a capital amount of 100 000 was paid to the attorney on 30 11 2007 and if they had agreed on 25 as he says he was supposed to get 75000 00 a further amount of 50577 64 was paid as costs to the attorney on the 05 02 2008 which is made up as follows 22785 64 relates to the attorneys legal fees party amp party costs 21030 00 relates to the advocates fees 6762 00 relates to costs of the medico legal i have called the claimant this morning and explained to him that after the matter has been settled there is very little the raf can do we can only advise i advised him to pursue the matter further with the law society
8544552 they are arguably if not defrauding then at least taking advantage of a public subsidy we would like to see them give more than the minimum the need is there
8544553 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8544554 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8544555 one of the most important reasons is that russia must protect abkhazia and south ossetia against genocide by the war criminal georgian president mikheil saakashvili
8544556 saakashvili is totally militarized and brought in outside support washington gave them all of the weapons and it has started to give weapons to the war criminal again
8544557 russia waited for 20 years to accept south ossetia and abkhazia south ossetia and abkhazia never lived together with independent georgia never the question is how many years should we wait russia now has to make a new course a new policy
8544558 if the u s and britain think they are first level countries and russia a second level country we dont agree
8544559 we are the first sort if you recognize that kosovo is an independent country fine we will do the same with other countries
8544560 this is a strong message to everybody those who think that aggression against russia is okay should know that there will be a strong response
8544561 the west is very much afraid of the militarization of russia they are afraid russia will solve its problems the way it did in south ossetia through military strength
8544562 we know there is a huge difference between the e u and the u s
8544563 we know that the bush administration is working for the election of john mccain

8544604 how insulting to suggest that those who question the mission question the troops
8544605 this is positive if the judge had a case against the tenants he would have ruled against them already judge richard keller agreed that the tenants of the california hotel have the upperhand in this case because ochi has violated the regulatory agreement involving low cost loans that stipulate that ochi is required to provide housing to the low income tenants of the california hotel for a 30 year period ochi and their partners are corrupt and abandoned the hotel i want the judge to allow the empty rooms at the hotel to be rented out so that there is enough money coming in to properly manage the building for the next 12 years theres no point in selling the building or forcing the tenants out of their housing because theres no place for the tenants to go most of the tenants are elderly and many are disabled this is not about making money this is all about housing the poor
8544606 ochi and their partners got ungodly credits and tax benefits
8544607 theres no one left in ochi to run the organization
8544608 they all ran off except for around one person and its basically only the tenants and the attorneys left to fight this out in the courts

8544625 samen wonnen we een campagne waarin de republikeinen zeiden dat ik te jong en te onervaren was om de opperbevelhebber te zijn klinkt bekend het werkte niet in 1992 omdat we ons aan de juiste kant van de geschiedenis bevonden en het zal evenmin werken in 2008 omdat barack obama zich aan de juiste van de geschiedenis bevindt
8544626 de keuze bij deze verkiezingen is helder deze tijden vragen meer dan een goed militair ze vragen een wijs leider een leider die de verandering kan brengen die we allemaal nodig hebben

8544704 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8544705 napster nsdq naps existed solely to provide the site and facilities for copyright infringement and its control over its system was directly intertwined with its ability to control infringing activity by contrast veohs right and ability to control its system does not equate to the right and ability to control infringing activity unlike napster there is no suggestion that veoh aims to encourage copyright infringement on its system and there is no evidence that veoh can control what content users choose to upload before it is uploaded unlike napster whose index was comprised entirely of pirated material veohs ability to control its index does not equate to an ability to identify and terminate infringing videos for the most part the files in question did not bear titles resembling plaintiffs works and io did not provide veoh with its titles to search

8544764 a tennis elbow is a chronic problem and one cant say how long the rehabilitation will take
8544765 we want to avoid surgery but if rehabilitation does not work well have to think again ive been treating him since the first tour match in taunton at the end of june and he has been taking painkillers
8544766 i said to the guys in the changing room after the game that not all is lost
8544767 we have been 2 0 down before and came back to win that series in pakistan somehow we have got to try to do it again it seems a long way away to win three games in a row but england have won two in a row and its only one more game than that we have talked about trying to forget what happened at trent bridge but you cant
8544768 the us state department yesterday warned that disclosure of secret information in the case of a british resident said to have been tortured before he was sent to guant namo bay would cause serious and lasting damage to security relations between the countries
8544769 the meeting seeks to explore opportunities on how the process can be salvaged from total collapse
8544770 house maids should have contracts once they are employed and that contract should have a clause on hiv and stigma
8544771 as in the case of illegal immigrants and environment young people who have just graduated should be hired to go from house to house to see if chambermaids have contracts and do those contract have a clause inhiv
8544772 the important thing is that networks should have more networks with the department of labour and address issues like this one
8544773 we should come together and share valuable information that we have
8544774 i know it is not contagious but there is also the issue of safety for my kids there
8544775 in a case where children especially small babies are involved i would like to know what the position would be if she gets a cut and the baby has a cut
8544776 i think in a case where there is an hiv positive baby the maid should also know
8544777 once an issue like this one is raised every mother feels like their child will be in danger we do not want to think beyond that
8544778 once the hiring is done you must talk to them about a lot of things including hygiene and generally responsible behaviour around the house and around the children all you have to do is talk
8544779 we should be thinking perceptively on all issues i do not think that when you discuss as openly as possible with your maid about hiv and other issues there would be a problem
8544780 what if one day you have a conflict with the maid would you be sure that she would not do anything to the child

8544795 our obligation towards peace in somalia is only one aspect
8544796 there are also requirements of our own including financial requirements the operation has been extremely expensive so we will have to balance the domestic pressures on the one hand and pressures in somalia on the other and try to come up with a balanced solution

8544805 a comprehensive scientifically robust and transparent process has been undertaken in the assessment of the potential environmental impacts of this mine expansion and i have given these matters thorough consideration before making my decision
8544806 in making my assessment i have been particularly concerned that the mine does not adversely affect groundwater values
8544807 the current comprehensive monitoring program will continue and heathgate resources will need to clearly demonstrate that they are having no impact on water quality within the great artesian basin or on aquifers outside the mining lease
8544808 essentially the company has been allowed to expand the area that it is able to do that three or fourfold
8544809 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular

8544855 compresi i motori funzionanti a biodiesel le caldaie a vapore i sistemi di riscaldamento centralizzati e gli impianti di termovalorizzazione delle biomasse infatti le caratteristiche chimiche del prodotto che viene generato dalla raffinazione meccanica dei rifiuti solidi urbani una volta eliminate le componenti inquinanti sono del tutto analoghe a quelle delle biomasse ma rispetto a queste sono povere in zolfo ed esenti da idrocarburi policiclici
8544856 un impianto di meccano raffinazione di taglia medio piccola da 20 mila tonnellate di rifiuti lanno presenta costi di circa 40 euro per tonnellata di materiale
8544857 per una identica quantit una discarica ne richiederebbe almeno 100 e un inceneritore 250 euro a questi costi vanno aggiunti quelli di gestione e in particolare le spese legate allo smaltimento delle scorie e ceneri per gli inceneritori o della gestione degli odori e dei gas delle discariche entrambi inesistenti nel thor quanto al calore i rifiuti che contengono cascami di carta producono 2 500 chilocalorie per chilo mentre dopo la raffinazione meccanica superano le 5 300 chilocalorie
8544858 unarea urbana di 5000 abitanti produce circa 50 tonnellate al giorno di rifiuti solidi
8544859 con queste thor permette di ricavare una media giornaliera di 30 tonnellate di combustibile 3 tonnellate di vetro 2 tonnellate tra metalli ferrosi e non ferrosi e 1 tonnellata di inerti nei quali compresa anche la frazione ricca di cloro dei rifiuti che viene separata per non inquinare il combustibile
8544860 new zealand had already made that commitment on where to have it and so on
8544861 we gave in to new zealand but hopefully to reciprocate that they would come and play in samoa before the tri nations next year that would be great
8544862 it would really sell the stadium help us with our gates and it would be good for people to come to samoa for holidays everyone could have a good week
8544863 we would very much appreciate it if we could have the next one in samoa we would always like to have a game against new zealand and what we are looking at is having the opportunity for new zealand to come to samoa at a time when everyone is available it is history in the making

8544865 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
8544866 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
8544867 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
8544868 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
8544869 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
8544870 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
8544871 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform

8544886 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god and so i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins as i say the catholic church for centuries has been discussing this and there are those whove decided i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy but it is it is also true that god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions and we want abortions to be safe rare and reduce the number of abortions thats why we have this fight in congress over contraception my republican colleagues do not support contraception if you want to reduce the number of abortions and we all do we must it would behoove you to support family planning and and contraception you would think but that is not the case so we have to take you know we have to handle this as respectfully this is sacred ground we have to handle it very respectfully and not politicize it as it has been and im not saying rick warren did because i dont think he did but others will try to

8544980 this information suggests that in the time that it has been a class c drug usage levels of cannabis have fallen and so has its strength
8544981 furthermore they call into question the validity of other controversial and publicly criticised government claims regarding drug policy for example the link between cannabis and mental illness or the legitimacy of our current classification system
8544982 unlikely to be an accurate representation of thc in cannabis across the board as not all samples submitted to the fss are routinely analysed for thc content the fss database also does not distinguish between sinsemilla cannabis and imported herbal cannabis
8544983 the fss participated in an in depth study of thc content for the home office in partnership with other forensic agencies and this is likely to be more representative of actual cannabis strength
8544984 causal link albeit a weak one between cannabis use and psychotic illness
8544985 my decision takes into account issues such as public perception and the needs and consequences for policing priorities there is a compelling case for us to act now rather than risk the future health of young people
8544986 on september 28 2008 80 years has passed since cannabis became illegal to use it was made illegal because no one knew if cannabis was a harmful drug or not
8544987 cannabis should be controlled taxed and licensed the current law is completely out of date
8544988 the protest in redditch will take place on saturday october 18 from 11am 7pm redditch is the home of jacqui smith home secretary we will hit her where it hurts most home
8544989 the protest will be large too large for redditch to handle we will close roads with barricades of disabled people in wheelchairs if this is whats needed for us to get noticed
8544990 the very least we want from this redditch protest is a meeting with jacqui smith if she fails to grant us one we will continue being in her face until she agrees
8544991 we are aware of the planned protest and are liaising with redditch council on the suitability of the proposed location
8544992 we are committed to ensuring that local residents and business can go about their lawful business undisturbed at the same time as recognising the rights of those who seek to carry out legitimate protests
8544993 we will ensure the demonstration is peaceful and does not cause any inconvenience to members of the public or highway obstruction
8544994 there may be people or critics that dont approve of what i do and they may not approve of her but im here because she is so talented

8545003 you think permatang pauh voters are stupid that they only rely on anwars personality to vote for him that was 1998
8545004 i used to support bn mic all my life but when they started harassing anwar with the sodomy allegations the second time i gave up
8545005 moreover i pray everyday and it is not right to witness injustice and not do anything about it hurting anwars family is too much if umno just want to maintain power
8545006 come on what about the umno guys who have been doing deals for 50 years what happenned to all of them
8545007 because if you are here i do not need to read the papers anymore i dont know if they are telling the truth or not i just read the sports pages

8545009 4 the more you beat anwar the more the people love him
8545010 i have received many complaints from the chinese community over the statement for the past two days
8545011 i am saddened that he could make such a statement it is a generalisation to assume that all chinese dont treat their friends well accusing the whole community like this is uncalled for
8545012 i know he was canvassing for votes during the recent by election but he didnt have to resort to using a racist statement
8545013 its insensitive to talk about other races like this we want him to retract the statement and we will demand an apology from him
8545014 we want to maintain peace and stability in the country
8545015 we are trying to contact him but until now we have not been able to do so not yet

8545023 taking a vacation is a great way for workers to re energize themselves and bring fresh ideas back to the table
8545024 unfortunately for some workers getting away can add unnecessary stress to their lives twelve percent of workers said they feel guilty when they are on vacation and 6 percent felt that it could lead to them losing their jobs if you prepare to be away in advance your organizational skills may impress your leadership team and allow you to take a truly work free vacation
8545025 i spent about four or five weeks out in florida training that means being away from your family when you could be at home training in really hot conditions and going in the gym a couple of times a day
8545026 and it was really been the first time early this year when i felt really good going on the court physically and its something thats nice to show that youre in great shape because i think it sends a message to the other players
8545027 i work really hard off the court to try and get the rewards in these tournaments
8545028 you know in the past i felt nervous coming into the bigger tournaments but now that ive started to work really hard off the court you go into the matches with no excuses no worries

8545096 det ndrer alts ikke ved at vi endnu engang st r tilbage overraskede over arbejdsmarkedets styrke
8545097 argumentet for genindf relsen af sp bidraget har netop v ret det fortsat st rke arbejdsmarked og risikoen for en overophedning herfra og det m da siges at den diskussion ikke er d d endnu p baggrund af dagens tal

8545101 i dont know who were going to start but i know who it wont be
8545102 i think the thing that stands out about him is hell race you to the drinking fountain hes so competitive to the details of things i like that and i saw that at the camps
8545103 athletically he had quick feet he was strong and he was still growing i followed him when he changed high schools and went and watched him play a game they didnt throw the ball very much as a team at the same time he took over the game i watched it was a close game he scrambled well he executed the offense well he took hits well he directed traffic he did all those intangibles that quarterbacks do
8545104 i dont know if the perception of harvard is justified because the quarterback who was there before i came got drafted in the seventh round like matt flynn
8545105 hes in his fourth year now with cincinnati so theres quality players there like there are here but obviously this is top notch you cant beat the sec
8545106 they dont have any kind of summer program so you show up right at the start of camp and youve got to learn the offense as quick as you can
8545107 its tough for a freshman to come in and really know it all
8545108 that was at the same time we had issues with perrilloux
8545109 we brought him in for a visit and he elected to transfer and come here
8545110 these are the greatest fans in the game as far as their love of the team and knowledge of the game at lsu what else can you ask for its a great place i mean its awesome to get here and get to play quarterback for a team that just won the national championship you kind of sit back and you have to appreciate it its a great honor and i feel very fortunate
8545111 it has been kind of an adventure everywhere ive been
8545112 i cant think of a harder thing for a high school kid to go through
8545113 he knew those guys at brownwood his whole life leaving that town was huge for him then all of a sudden hes here it was a very hostile situation
8545114 he was very calm the whole game thats when i knew he was special
8545115 i think he has the personality to start early in his career
8545116 hes never too high nor is he too low when bottle rockets are firing on the field he doesnt get all hyped and nervous thats just how he is
8545117 i was young then and so i was definitely nervous and scared
8545118 those were my old friends i was playing against as the game got going it worked out then i met new friends it was all good it was a neat experience it helped me grow as a person it really helped me out in life and can see where it could help me here

8545120 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
8545121 depending on where you focus on the details of the report you can see some different stories on where home prices are headed record year over year declines were reported in both the 10 city and 20 city composites in june however they are very close to the values reported for may the rate of home price decline may be slowing for the month the 10 city composite was down 0 6 and the 20 city composite was down 0 5 while still falling these are far less than the 2 2 5 monthly drops seen earlier in 2008 in june nine of the 20 cities were up month to month compared with seven in may nevertheless not one market is showing a positive return over the past 12 months and seven of the metro areas are reporting declines in excess of 20 0

8545163 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8545164 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8545165 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8545166 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8545167 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8545168 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8545169 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8545170 we are excited about uniting with james hardie to provide the contractor market with a superior blade

8545177 nevertheless we are cautiously optimistic that home sales are approaching a bottom and that the newly enacted first time home buyer tax credit which went into effect as part of the housing stimulus bill on july 30 will help stimulate sales and provide crucial support for a market turnaround
8545178 there has been silence on the domestic side about hiv aids
8545179 still see hiv aids as an epidemic that is affecting people in this country particularly minorities
8545180 at a point where weve had a great deal of experience with hiv aids
8545181 some things that we know work well there are some things we need to modify and change and there are some things we just shouldnt be a part of
8545182 strong protocols in how we implement care and treatment for those who are impacted by hiv aids
8545183 the aids epidemic isnt about some other time or some other people its about my brother and your sister
8545184 we help people if they have no food if their lights are going to be shut off all of the things that would keep people from getting medication
8545185 scaled up response for making available affordable treatments and control
8545186 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 over the last four years in comparison with aids related deaths we had in 2003 to 2004 because of increased free treatment
8545187 this represents a 67 survival rate but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
8545188 helping to remove the fear and stigma that prevents people from learning their hiv status
8545189 what they described as the black churchs silence on hiv aids
8545190 fight for basic human equality providing a basis for more realistic outreach
8545191 pressure on human rights issues such as the criminalization of homosexuality could help bring those at risk out of the shadows
8545192 in todays market where home prices are dropping its more important than ever for sellers to maximize their sales price
8545193 its clear from this consumer reports research that sellers are better off using a for sale by owner method to sell their homes not only will they get their asking price theyll also avoid paying an expensive commission fee that would only lower the amount they actually receive for their home for a 300 000 home the 5 000 price differential and the commission paid to the agent represent a loss to a home seller of more than 20 000
8545194 consumer reports is a well respected publication and its research should help more people understand the financial advantages of selling their own home

8545223 one of the most important reasons is that russia must protect abkhazia and south ossetia against genocide by the war criminal georgian president mikheil
8545224 saakashvili is totally militarized and brought in outside support washington gave them all of the weapons and it has started to give weapons to the war criminal again
8545225 russia waited for 20 years to accept south ossetia and abkhazia south ossetia and abkhazia never lived together with independent georgia never the question is how many years should we wait russia now has to make a new course a new policy
8545226 if the u s and britain think they are first level countries and russia a second level country we dont agree
8545227 we are the first sort if you recognize that kosovo is an independent country fine we will do the same with other countries
8545228 this is a strong message to everybody those who think that aggression against russia is okay should know that there will be a strong response
8545229 the west is very much afraid of the militarization of russia they are afraid russia will solve its problems the way it did in south ossetia through military strength
8545230 we know there is a huge difference between the e u and the u s

8545235 die entwicklung der einzelnen ertragsquellen zeigt dass wir im operativen kundengesch ft gut unterwegs sind
8545236 die lbbw hat in den vergangenen sechs monaten entscheidende meilensteine erreicht
8545237 die finanzmarktkrise hat nochmals verdeutlicht dass unsere schon lange vorher eingeleitete weichenstellung zum ausbau des kundengesch fts strategisch richtig ist dass es zu einem kundenorientierten gesch ftsmodell f r landesbanken keine alternative gibt zeigen die erfahrungen der kleineren institute sachsen lb und lrp mit geringem kunden und gro em kreditersatzgesch ft mit der integration beider banken demonstriert die lbbw ihre wirtschaftliche st rke
8545238 vielf ltige gut ausbalancierte ertragsquellen die konservative risikopolitik und die solide kapitalausstattung sind die erfolgsfaktoren an denen die lbbw weiterhin festhalten wird auch zuk nftig werden sowohl organisches als auch anorganisches wachstum m gliche handelsoptionen darstellen

8545253 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal healthcare helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of the country and the hopes of our people

8545259 im training hard and i cant wait to get in there
8545260 hes probably the toughest guy ive fought this far his biggest strength is hes so well rounded hes good at everything hes got wrestling hes got stand up hes got ground theres not really a weak spot i can pick im just trying to fight the fight wherever it goes its a competitive fight
8545261 i train hard for every fight it doesnt matter who it is i train hard
8545262 i always look for the finish so if that happens thatd be great im preparing for a three round war thats what you got to prepare for if the fight stops early good for me but im preparing to go three full rounds
8545263 anderson silva can be beat too of course hes a real tough guy hes a straight up bad ass but he can be beat too on any given day i would love to get that opportunity
8545264 if thats the fight that the world wants to see then i guess were going to have to sit back and talk about it
8545265 i think thats going to be a hard one to get across to both sides theyre friends theyve been together but at the end of the day its a business and sometimes youve gotta go in there and you shake hands theyve been on each other for free in training i can just tell you that it would really have to be something that makes sense for both guys
8545266 he had a little bit of turmoil in his life and worked through that right now hes training really hard hes in brazil in a secluded place outside the city right now hes actually training with andre galvao hes very focused hes very determined
8545267 he hasnt been very happy with his last two performances in the wec hes had time off and hes let some little injuries heal up and i think youre going to see a different paulo filho from what i understand talking to him his spirits are high and he really wants to prove why hes the no 2 ranked guy in the world in the middleweight division

8545271 if you look over the last 10 years life expectancy has improved across the board but its improved more for people with high education than it has for people with low education
8545272 behavior and lifestyle are determined by the circumstances in which people find themselves
8545273 the u s invests probably less in improving that social gradient there are countries that really invest in making sure that all children have quality education regardless of the education of their parents there are countries that invest in making sure that everybody has access to a minimum level of quality of health care were one of the few countries that does not do that
8545274 health equity within a generation is achievable it is the right thing to do and now is the right time to do it
8545275 were wasting a lot of the money that we invest in health and health care
8545276 all sorts of studies show that targeting the social determinants of health is more cost effective for everybody not just for those at the bottom everybody in this country whether they know it or not suffers from a system that is not committed to closing that health gap

8545288 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged
8545289 two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing
8545290 police have said at a very early stage that this is an arson
8545291 its very unusual for them to do that before fire investigators have been able to get in and investigate the cause of the fire but clearly there are reasons why theyve done that
8545292 buildings that are far apart where you wouldnt have expected a fire to naturally spread have also been destroyed so its clear that there were a number of seats to this fire
8545293 kirstie is horse mad and so is jill theyd filled the place with animals

8545311 its not our business were not making any comment we dont wish to discuss it particularly with the media
8545312 the lack of information appears to be more for protecting the sport than the family
8545313 out of respect for taylor please refrain from using this to fuel any type of attack on what you feel is wrong with the sport of gymnastics
8545314 when they get injured theyre kicked off the team and have to earn their way back
8545315 thats what happened to taylor she wasnt fully recovered in time for nationals
8545316 i want the public to be aware of the risks associated with gymnastics
8545317 i want gymnastics ontario and gymnastics canada to take responsibility for what happens when gymnasts are injured or have their careers ended
8545318 life altering for her and for me its a damn disaster
8545319 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8545320 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8545321 if you look over the last 10 years life expectancy has improved across the board but its improved more for people with high education than it has for people with low education
8545322 behavior and lifestyle are determined by the circumstances in which people find themselves

8545327 of course he won permatang pauh is his place and the seat was vacated by his wife we were the underdogs and its inevitable that we lost
8545328 anwar is not that great only that luck was not on arifs side if the 447 spoilt votes plus hanafis 92 all went to bn plus 857 more voters cast their votes in favour of bn then anwars majority would not have been 15 617 perhaps less than wan azizahs then he could not claim that he has won
8545329 permatang pauh voters did not intend to vote for anwar but were worried that if they voted for arif shah then bn would claim the victory and abdullah would say voting for bn was a vote of confidence for him and that would be his triumph
8545330 so the voters went for anwar because they wanted pak lah to realise that he was no longer popular
8545331 bn and umnos problems and weaknesses could only be addressed if they have learned to admit and accept their defeat identify workable solutions and implement the necessary reforms
8545332 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8545333 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8545334 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8545335 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8545336 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8545337 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year declines in the present situation index both in terms of business conditions and the labor market appear to be moderating the expectations index which posted a significant gain this month suggests better times may be ahead however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
8545338 we made the very difficult decision to permanently close the facility following a strategic review of the mills ability to be competitive both today and over the longer term
8545339 given a variety of factors including our business outlook the structural challenges of operating in this region and the condition of the mill at the time it was delivered to us by potlatch we simply cannot rationalize making the significant investment required to make the mill economically viable
8545340 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicate how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle
8545341 we believe we are the only ones in the country doing something like this on this level
8545342 its downtown its a historic area its run out of a bike shop and its free
8545343 i was just in paris and i was thrilled to see their program and all the bikes on the street
8545344 the potential is there to turn philadelphia into an incredible bicycling city an incredible green city
8545345 renting for one day costs as much as joining for one year
8545346 i go back and forth from my office to court now i can rent one of these
8545347 we knew it would be something that we could get to work within the district and by including it in the contract we didnt have to pay for it
8545348 smartbike is intended to provide riders with the missing link between existing points of public transportation and desired destinations
8545349 there are plenty of bike shops where tourists can go and rent bikes
8545350 im trying to use them how do i use them
8545351 if there was a way for tourists to sign up that would improve it
8545352 residents nonresidents businesspeople students tourists anybody who can ride a bicycle
8545353 station owners have to value whats in their tanks based on what the replacement costs are whats it going to cost them to buy off the rack basically
8545354 so when that price goes up theyre going to start raising the price at the pump although its usually a short term thing
8545355 we are confident the evidence will show that astrazeneca charged the counties properly discounted prices and fully complied with its obligations and that we will prevail in any future judicial proceedings

8545381 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8545382 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8545383 for example while fuel duty recognises the environmental costs of driving it also pays for important public services including new roads and public transport and efforts to tackle child poverty

8545391 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of climate change and in fact green taxes have fallen as a proportion of overall taxes since labour came to power

8545393 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab
8545394 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8545395 more and more people are realising that green taxes have nothing to do with being green theyre just an excuse to tax us more
8545396 theyve got more to do with a greedy government that is trying to fill a black hole in its finances
8545397 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed families and businesses

8545406 i was told to make an india film and i had been ruminating on foeticide for a long time we have an ostrich like approach to it pretending it does not exist
8545407 let a female child be born somewhere else here let a male child be born
8545408 when female foeticide is so common and organised technology meant to check the health of the child is used for killing it in connivance with the medical community and influential civil and social groups

8545413 what youve heard is absolutely right this is unprecedented and overwhelming ive never gone through this experience before throughout my performance at the 02 arena the audience didnt sit at all all 20 000 of them stood on their feet while i performed
8545414 it was a deeply moving and humbling experience ive never been in a performance like this ever and perhaps the audience too had never felt like this before the entire venue was sold out we all got standing ovations the audience just freaked out
8545415 lets admit it the crowds came in such huge numbers mainly to see the big b we were the side attractions the way the audiences everywhere reacted to him had to be seen to be believed

8545424 it gave voice to americas ideals in a way that has been done very rarely in any speech in american history
8545425 i was 2 years old at the time and i think its fair to say that had it not been for not just the speech but the movement behind the speech the sentiments behind the speech the work and the toil and the risks that were taken by previous generations then i wouldnt be in denver on thursday accepting the nomination for the presidency
8545426 hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what sen mccain is offering and hes going to talk about an alternative path thats rooted in the best of what this country is and the kind of future that we can build if we take it
8545427 the glimmer of hope here is that the industry as a whole is structurally profitable
8545428 we needed to transform what had become a broken holding company in the late 90s into an integrated operating company
8545429 we dont anticipate any change in jobs as a result of this transaction
8545430 we see more and more businesses operating on a global basis
8545431 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus

8545434 unisys could sublet if they want theyre in at 29 75 a square foot well one and two liberty are now advertising to the extent they have space available at all for 30 a square foot
8545435 the question is whether they could find a single tenant or would have to multitenant the space
8545436 and with the money they could lose subletting the floor they could buy a lot of advertising on billboards in downtown philadelphia to get their name out
8545437 unisys knows theres other good reasons to be downtown because of the labor pool the excitement the synergies to be in the city
8545438 it will take a couple of years even after the national licensing goes into effect to clean it up
8545439 now that the economy is so tight for cash strapped consumers it is more important than ever for states to provide reasonable protection against rate gouging by small lenders
8545440 we believe that the security and breadth of our business is resilient to more challenging economic conditions

8545446 the more important thing to look at is the future expectations which were quite encouraging
8545447 given the tightness in the credit markets and a gloomier global outlook and that commodity prices have come off
8545448 that is why we saw such a sharp sell off
8545449 the market has taken it at face value and taken out some of the probability of rate cuts across the strip

8545457 we have no tv ads that are airing right now
8545458 it gives you an advantage because you can prepare internally without letting on in an attempt to catch your opponents off guard
8545459 in the context of modern politics thats a pretty significant advantage
8545460 fixed election dates prevent governments from calling snap elections for short term political advantage
8545461 they level the playing field for all parties and the rules are clear for everybody
8545462 we have an increasingly difficult parliamentary situation because we have increasingly divergent views on a range of issues whether its the economy the environment the criminal justice system the view of our country in the world
8545463 those will obviously all be issues on which the various parties will contrast their positions when we get into an actual election campaign
8545464 the case received publicity some of which was unfavourable to mcdonalds who were portrayed in some quarters as bullies who were trying to stifle freedom of speech

8545483 our policy is to improve our schools any way we can
8545484 we support the directions of these reforms and we look forward to working with the commonwealth on the details
8545485 the good thing about the relationship now with the new federal labor government is that we talk to each other
8545486 there will no doubt be a range of discussions over the coming weeks and months to nut out the detail of these important initiatives
8545487 thats something that parents want something students need and thats our policy
8545488 the direction of these changes is completely consistent with the changes that weve already brought in in south australia
8545489 so were very comfortable with the changes we support the broad direction of the reforms
8545490 principles here are quality of performance of teaching staff and we support the highest quality teaching staff that we can get in our schools and managing that performance
8545491 the other principle is one of transparency knowing about the performance of schools and we support that principle
8545492 the commonwealth wants to take the agenda further were more than happy with that
8545493 under premier rann education is in a mess and parents students and teachers are paying the price
8545494 weve increased funding to our schools by 52 per cent during the life of our government
8545495 but people always expect us to spend taxpayer funds in the most efficient way possible so were always trying to economise in the way we use taxpayers dollars
8545496 but the critical thing is we just get more service its being ploughed back into education
8545497 these reforms are consistent with the direction we want to take education
8545498 any sensible plan will allow us to compare likes with likes so were looking at measuring the performance of schools and not the things beyond their control
8545499 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this mr rudd told fairfax radio network today
8545500 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8545501 we are moving to a system where we can compare apples with apples he said
8545502 i notice the liberals were saying that they had come up with some of these ideas in the past well thats terrific
8545503 twelve years they were in government 24 reports on boosting quality education in our schools and not much to show for it in terms of real action
8545504 from what we have seen it appears to be essentially a reheated coalition policy much of which has already been legislated he said
8545505 its punitive its saying principals perform or heads will roll she told reporters
8545506 its shifting responsibility for the educational outcomes of the nation onto the shoulders of principals and making them personally responsible when the government isnt adequately funding schools to be able to do the job
8545507 theres no point in the world with comparing a rich school on sydneys north shore with elizabeth north in south australia and how the school is going there she said
8545508 our whole plan is to analyse student population and compare like schools with like schools
8545509 the two groups include some of the most vulnerable women and children with urgent medical needs requiring immediate attention
8545510 this partnership will provide home builders with a low cost and integrated software solution that will allow them to streamline their business process

8545513 we recognized the strengths in each of our products and realized our customers would be much better off if we worked together
8545514 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time mr maccallum said to fairfax paper
8545515 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8545516 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8545517 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period mr maccallum said
8545518 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8545519 im glad to see your school uniform is green and gold so you can cheer us on

8545524 id either have to sell my house and move out of the redlands or sell my trucks which i cant do or park them at rocklea
8545525 id have less time with the family and more costs
8545526 ninety nine per cent of people who drive trucks dont go out of their way to annoy their neighbours
8545527 because circumstances exist where some heavy vehicles provide an unacceptable disruption to residential neighbourhoods the council needs to control and regulate this activity
8545528 everyone wants to know how to throw these flaming nets you dont throw them you glide them out like a frisbee i might do a bit of sewing too at the festival
8545529 if youve got one of these on your boat you never have to buy a boat
8545530 theres no way you could make a living out of it thats probably why theres no one else doing it its a dying art ask a young bloke if he wants to sit here and sew for 20 hours and hell tell you to forget it hes going to the pub with his mates you have to rocks in your head to sew and sew it gets you in the back
8545531 i call him the oldtimer it keeps him out of mischief or gets him into it one of the two

8545659 many believe that today as a new global system forms china brazil india russia and china have an undeniable role to play the tremendous economic growth of these powers does come along with political influence but can we expect these countries to exercise the role that the united states plays at the global level or in clearer words do these countries possess the audacity to forcefully intrude on international affairs like the united states does
8545660 americas great generosity and sacrifice both in money and in lives is well known no nation in history has offered its sons to death and drained its coffers for the sake of others the way the united states of america has courageous intrusion requires a spirit that stands apart from industrial growth or agricultural development todays newly industrial states dont presently have this spirit nor will they have it in the future because such a spirit requires so much money and so many souls that if any of these nations had such courage its coffers would quickly be emptied and its economy would collapse never to rise again

8545694 grunds tzlich halte ich es f r positiv wenn der patientenanwalt diese thematik hinterfragt allerdings frage ich mich warum er keine ursachenforschung betreibt und etwa die eklatanten berschreitungen der arbeitszeiten der rztinnen und rzte in den krankenh usern ignoriert
8545695 im spital sind arbeitszeiten weit ber dem vern nftigen ma leider normal die rzteschaft arbeitet jedoch nicht freiwillig so lange sondern aufgrund des bestehenden rztemangels die rztekammer in nieder sterreich wehrt sich schon seit langem gegen die unhaltbaren zust nde in spit lern
8545696 zun chst sollten die arbeitsbedingungen verbessert werden unausgeschlafene unter zeitdruck arbeitende berlastete rztinnen und rzte sind sicherlich nicht hilfreich f r die behandlung der patientinnen und patienten
8545697 das krankenanstaltenarbeitszeitgesetz wurde zwar novelliert aber dadurch erfahren mehr als 50 prozent der rztinnen und rzte keinen schutz weil sanktionen nur bei privatrechtlichen institutionen greifen k nnen ffentlichrechtliche dienstgeber wie beispielsweise in nieder sterreich sind davon ausgenommen
8545698 durch berlastete rzteschaft kann es nat rlich wie berall leichter zu fehlern kommen
8545699 kommunikationsst rungen mit betroffenen die vielleicht sogar aufgrund der vorgaben der politik nicht das bekommen was sie sich einbilden sind f r uns kein kriterium wenn es tats chlich missst nde geben sollte kann man diese offenlegen und mit uns sprechen wir verwehren uns dagegen dass die rzteschaft pauschal wegen angeblicher qualit tsm ngel verunglimpft wird

8545703 die konsequente und intensive forschung tr gt dazu bei die qualit t der unfallbehandlung zu heben und dadurch die patientinnen und patienten schneller gesund zu machen und ins erwerbsleben r ckzuf hren das spart wiederum behandlungs und rentenkosten
8545704 es ist bemerkenswert zu sehen dass nicht nur die versorgung der patienten sondern auch die forschung auf h chstem niveau stattfindet

8545731 by changing the basis of competition and leading on service rather than price banks can transform branches from a perceived burden into a very real benefit
8545732 its a win win scenario reward your customers with a superior service and they are more likely to reward you with greater loyalty which in turn leads to more sales of products to the customer and greater branch profitability

8545767 ive been doing the job nine years i actually dont think anyone should do more than 10 years running a business
8545768 we are surprised to see the ceo who we regard highly stepping down later this year we suspect there may be some disappointment in the market
8545769 there is nothing currently on the radar with regards to acquisition or with regards to strategic partnerships but we are continually looking for an opportunity which we would see as the right fit
8545770 this applies not only in the uk but also in its less well established international markets where the rating agency believes that friends providents franchise is generally weaker than in the uk and where there exist large international as well as local competitors
8545771 there will be no job cuts we are a business we believe in pursuing a long term approach to growing the business were not into making knee jerk cuts in staff costs just to protect short term profit
8545772 our ownership structure is key here because were owned by our partners employees they want us to take a long term not a short term approach our structure means that at these times we might take a different approach to some other businesses
8545773 governor romney would help shore up mccains perceived lack of economic experience
8545774 also romney strategically helps as far as the states of michigan new hampshire and the mountain states like colorado new mexico and nevada that have been viewed in play as well
8545775 a disaster for all concerned and especially for the gop
8545776 all the mccain folks need to say is look what the alternative will be and that will scare up the base
8545777 we have taken a more prudent stance with market conditions potentially deteriorating further ahead of a recovery
8545778 the biggest flop to date in the history of afrikaans music
8545779 just over 1 000 paying guests arrived we expected between 10 000 and 15 000
8545780 the concerts total income was r193 000 whereas the total expenses on marketing the singers and the supersport stadium in centurion were r1 5m
8545781 the whole thing was a miserable failure and it was not my fault
8545782 now take a strong stand on singers who are contracted and then not paid
8545783 these days it happens too often that singers are abused like this somewhere we have to take a strong stand for the sake of the younger singers who are still struggling financially
8545784 being the villain in this story i am beginning to feel like someone who has assaulted a child i tried my best
8545785 but if people want to take on me and my good name the gloves will come off today then i will fight whether it be steve anton or whoever i am not scared
8545786 personally i think steve and anton are motivated by greed taking into account the pathetic turn out at the concert the loss of r1 3m that the sponsor suffered and the fact that each of them has already been paid r225 000 it looks like they want to squeeze blood from a stone
8545787 but it is final no one is getting a cent more out of brikor

8545793 this is the first study to show their parabens accumulation in human tissues it demonstrates that if people are exposed to these chemicals then the chemicals will accumulate in their bodies their detection in human breast tumours is of concern since parabens have been shown to be able to mimic the action of the female hormone estrogen estrogen can drive the growth of human breast tumours it would therefore seem especially prudent to consider whether parabens should continue to be used in such a wide range of cosmetics applied to the breast area including deodorants
8545794 it is welcome additional information and we will want to examine the findings in detail
8545795 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

8545804 the guy who posted the photos to the world should be fired things like that should be left private and dealt with via apple and foxconn not posted for the world to see if that girl really did get fired it would be entirely due to the idiot who posted her photo on the world wide web
8545805 i guess i figured that the photos would be of interest to the wider iphone community and it would appear my guess was correct given the hundreds of thousands of hits across the internet
8545806 unfortunately yes it was a risk to post them but if its judged to be in the public interest then i think the decision was the correct one at the end of the day the girl in the photo is ultimately responsible for her actions

8545808 consequently our revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 is less certain we anticipate a lower rate of market growth than in the first half and are therefore taking some early steps to tighten our cost base in a number of markets
8545809 nonetheless we remain confident of delivering a result at the upper end of market expectations

8545813 the russians dont bring a full playbook to asian issues the way the other powers do
8545814 its true russia has energy exports and its true that china japan and south korea are vying for ownership of a pipeline from russia
8545815 but the nature of asian economic integration and development is much more about manufacturing and high technology and the russians dont bring very much into that discussions
8545816 is very important because there are so many post colonial stakes and unresolved territorial issues
8545817 russias attacks on georgia has essentially violated a norm which a lot of asian governments are trying to reinforce in their own region
8545818 the present conflict is about the geopolitics of the former soviet space which moscow seeks to free from us power and about the world order which russia wants to rid of us domination
8545819 it is actually economically irresponsible to impose this sort of tax increase at a time when we are seeing clear signs that demand in the economy is slowing
8545820 this new mine is some kilometres from the existing mine and it will use the same harmful technique of pumping acid into the ground to dissolve the uranium
8545821 mr speaker this was unacceptable my department has moved swiftly to correct this situation and patients have been placed in a position on the official waiting list that takes into account the date they should have been placed onto the official waiting list in the first place
8545822 it wont give any comfort to the 1900 people that currently sit on the north west regional hospital waiting list
8545823 does the prime minister expect a shopper in port hedland to drive 500 kilometres to parabadoo to get the best deal on a block of cheese

8545840 i booked a return transfer separate from my package holiday through major online travel retailer they didnt turn up for my return trip to the airport at the end of my holiday and i was told to get a taxi which cost 112 euro
8545841 this is a disgraceful and immoral state of affairs the bullying of a holidaymaker simply because she decided to place a review of her experience on a well known travel review website is completely unacceptable can it be right that holidaymakers are subjected to this form of ad hoc justice for the sake of all holidaymakers and travel providers the package travel directive amp regulations must be extended to incorporate all forms of holiday contract and get rid of the artificial distinction between a package holiday and a so called diy holiday the consumer must be protected
8545842 if we had not won tonight then i would have said it was our own fault
8545843 i thought it was a cracking cup tie but i didnt think our football was that great
8545844 we had decent chances in the first half but we didnt take them
8545845 our back four deserve a lot of credit for hanging in there in extra time
8545846 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8545847 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8545848 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8545849 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8545850 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8545851 pre os crescentes de alimentos significam que muitos fazendeiros pelo mundo est o colhendo lucros recordes
8545852 na corrida para tirar proveito do dif cil mercado global de alimentos o brasil tem uma s rie de vantagens sobre o seu vizinho do sul
8545853 a decis o tinha como inten o for ar os fazendeiros argentinos a venderem sua produ o em casa criando assim um excesso de oferta dom stica que manteria pre os baixos e a infla o sob controle
8545854 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8545855 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8545856 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8545857 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8545858 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8545859 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8545860 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8545861 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8545862 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8545863 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8545864 a firm defense of quiet material pleasure is the only way to oppose the universal folly of fast life

8545892 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8545893 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8545894 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8545895 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8545896 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8545897 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8545898 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8545899 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

8545901 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8545902 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8545903 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8545904 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8545905 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8545906 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8545907 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8545908 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8545909 more bad legislation is passed in the name of surely something must be done
8545910 tenho uma surpresa para voc s temos um convidado especial esta noite
8545911 acho que michelle obama n o lan ou mal a conven o o que que acham
8545912 e se n o me engano hillary clinton dinamitou esta sala ontem noite
8545913 e em caso d vida penso que o presidente bill clinton nos lembrou o que ter um presidente que coloca os interesses das pessoas frente de tudo o resto
8545914 barack obama est preparado para ser presidente dos estados unidos
8545915 h 16 anos os republicanos diziam de mim que era demasiado jovem e inexperiente isto soa vos familiar
8545916 a campanha de obama gerou tanto calor que aumentou o aquecimento global no final a minha candidata n o ganhou mas estou muito orgulhoso da sua campanha e porque n o se deu por vencida em nome de toda a gente que a defendeu e em nome de todas as mudan as a que quis dar impulso
8545917 a actual ministra da sa de parece ser uma honesta defensora do servi o nacional de sa de ter poder os sinais n o s o animadores
8545918 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8545919 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8545920 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8545921 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8545922 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8545923 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8545924 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8545925 who are open to doing something on the production side
8545926 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8545927 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8545928 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8545929 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8545930 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8545931 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8545932 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8545933 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8545934 i dont know what it is about this place but they play us tough
8545935 i can see why so many third base coaches send runners
8545936 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8545937 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8545938 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8545939 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8545940 il est encore trop t t pour aborder ce dossier
8545941 la situation dans la r gion doit tre r solue par le dialogue

8545944 lusage excessif par la russie de la force militaire en g orgie et la poursuite de son occupation de parties du territoire de la g orgie
8545945 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8545946 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8545947 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8545948 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8545949 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8545950 and im sure theyre wearing their american flag lapel pins is she they shouldnt have to stop doing their very important work making us feel safe by making sure were very very scared

8545961 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8545962 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8545963 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8545964 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8545966 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8545967 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8545968 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8545969 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8545970 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel

8545972 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8545983 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

8545992 weve been doing more marketing in terms of getting people to report crime
8545993 in the last year weve really been pushing that more
8545994 we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
8545995 lets face it jungle islands are probably less exciting as they were four years ago
8545996 if we wanted to make the next game set in the forest of south america we could do it but i think to save time for us one of the reasons we chose to use the african setting is because we felt that in order to retain the far cry brand value of an exotic dangerous environment a place that maybe people havent had a chance to see themselves or have seen extensively in film television and other games we wanted to choose africa
8545997 cualquier duda acerca de por qu rusia invadi georgia se han disipado
8545998 reconociendo ilegalmente los territorios georgianos de abjazia y osetia del sur dmitry medvedev el presidente ruso dej claro que la meta de mosc es la de redibujar el mapa de europa usando la fuerza
8545999 esta guerra nunca ha sido sobre osetia del sur o georgia
8546000 mosc est usando su invasi n preparada durante a os para reconstruir su imperio conseguir mayor poder en el suministro energ tico de europa y castigar a aquellos que creen que la democracia puede florecer en sus fronteras
8546001 donde occidente actu para prevenir la limpieza tnica la limpieza tnica de georgia est siendo usada por rusia para consolidar su anexi n militar
8546002 el pr ximo paso en el gui n de la invasi n rusa de desinformaci n y anexi n es un cambio de r gimen
8546003 si mosc puede expulsar al gobierno de georgia elegido democr ticamente entonces puede intimidar a otros gobiernos europeos
8546004 el mensaje est claro rusia har lo que le plazca
8546005 si mosc est intentando derrocar nuestro gobierno usando sus herramientas letales dejadnos resistir con nuestras herramientas democr ticas que han sostenido m s de 60 a os de paz euroatl ntica

8546008 we dont want to get past the deadline having not signed anyone and then get sucked into a fight at the wrong end of the table
8546009 this deterioration of confidence is a sign that leaders arent meeting the needs of the organization
8546010 every business leader needs to take note of this if they want to grow their organization
8546011 great leadership doesnt happen by accident organizations need to start listening to their leaders and make the right development investments if they want different results than theyre getting now
8546012 the message isnt clear if ceos think these are the traits they need in the next five years but leaders dont think these are respected
8546013 leaders are focused on the bottom line because that is the message they are hearing loud and clear
8546014 this is scary considering the high rate of retirements were expecting over the next 5 10 years
8546015 organizations will have empty seats in key leadership roles if they dont begin planning for their future leadership
8546016 these arent good odds for programs that are supposed to increase success
8546017 organizations need to look at how theyre developing those individuals and identify why the failure rate is so high
8546018 were sending leaders into key multinational roles in rapidly growing industries and geographies without the tools they need
8546019 theyre facing new cultures and ambiguous environments without much preparation

8546099 there are many other steps that we can take and that is a fairly draconian one
8546100 if theres an alarm going off all weekend people will say please turn that off the point is what are the legal implications can it be done easily are there severe constitutional difficulties

8546380 if we consider mankind as a whole and substitute it for a single individual we discover that it too has developed delusions which are inaccessible to logical criticism and which contradict reality if in spite of this they the delusions are able to exert an extraordinary power over men investigation leads us to the same explanation as in the case of the single individual they owe their power to the element of historical truth which they have brought up from the repression of the forgotten and primeval past

8546437 india is an open economy and there is substantial potential for growth bolstered by foreign exchange inflows
8546438 however the economy is not dependent on foreign money as it is underpinned by domestic institutional money such as domestic life insurance companies which are amongst the biggest investors at present
8546439 the development of a world class infrastructure is central to indias emergence as a global economic powerhouse
8546440 this is despite the fact that uncertain global markets are undergoing a correction and the indian markets are likely to be range bound in the near term

8546443 janganlah kamu iri hati terhadap keistimewaan yang dianugerahkan allah terhadap sebagian kamu atas sebagian yang lain laki laki mempunyai hak atas apa yang diusahakannya dan perempuan juga mempunyai hak atas apa yang diusahakannya
8546444 maka tuhan mereka mengabulkan permintaan mereka dengan berfirman sesungguhnya aku tidak akan menyia nyiakan amal orang yang beramal di antara kamu baik lelaki maupun perempuan

8546456 there are worse things in life than death have you ever spent an evening with an insurance salesman
8546457 love is the answer but while youre waiting for the answer sex raises some pretty interesting questions
8546458 a fast word about oral contraception i asked a girl to go to bed with me she said no
8546459 basically my wife was immature id be at home in the bath and shed come in and sink my boats
8546460 i am not afraid of death i just dont want to be there when it happens
8546461 i am thankful for laughter except when milk comes out of my nose
8546462 if you want to make god laugh tell him about your plans
8546463 the talent for being happy is appreciating and liking what you have instead of what you dont have
8546464 i dont want clever conversation what kind of thing is that to say to someone i like your dull conversation just fine yeah any woman would love to hear that and b i can name 10 cheesy love songs better than just the way you are right off the top of my head
8546465 its our opinion that its inconsistent with the surrounding largely rural area
8546466 its going to create a significant amount of new traffic and people like me and my family moved out here to get away from the city
8546467 doesnt even meet the existing county standards with its lack of shoulders
8546468 but this site became available and they thought it would work well as a spiritual retreat center
8546469 the hindu community is larger than most realize but were not expecting to have tremendous amounts of people visiting it
8546470 on any given day 20 or so people may come and 100 on the weekends a hindu temple is not like a presbyterian or catholic church with intense traffic on fridays saturdays and sundays
8546471 feel that the temple in st louis county is serving the population well but there is a need and a demand for another facility
8546472 ive met some of the applicants and theyre very very nice people
8546473 we dont have any expectation that they wouldnt be good neighbors
8546474 a school and a church can go into any zoned areas in jefferson county regardless of how they are zoned
8546475 russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8546476 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8546477 medvedevs unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8546478 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8546479 we dont want a new cold war he has a big responsibility not to start one
8546480 my visit is designed to send a simple message we have not forgotten our commitments to you
8546481 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8546482 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8546483 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8546484 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8546485 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8546486 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8546487 assessed values are estimated to decrease by 1 7 percent in the 2009 reassessment process due to the depressed housing market
8546488 sales taxes show signs of weakness as consumers have slowed their spending and dedicated a higher percentage of their budget to gasoline which does not produce sales tax revenue for the county
8546489 these policies alone will not fix our structural problems however they will allow for some level of cost containment
8546490 the county sets its budget just like you and i do for our homes
8546491 they overestimate spending and underestimate revenue and the result is that theres always money left at the end of the year
8546492 what it comes down to is whether the county can afford to give us a raise the answer is yes they can they just need to set their priorities
8546493 a perfect example would be the lateral sewer repair program there is some money probably four or five million sitting there in that fund but by nature of the law passed regarding that program the money has to go to fixing sewers not for pay raises or whatever
8546494 but as county employees retire and youre talking about a hiring freeze where one person will then be doing the job that three persons once did the public may see longer lines at county offices and other inconveniences at some point down the line
8546495 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8546496 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8546497 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8546498 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first
8546499 were in unchartered territory ive never seen it this wet
8546500 it really was a one in 100 year rainfall event for this region
8546501 there was no doubt that greening was this industrys highest priority and greatest concern
8546502 one of the most important reasons is that russia must protect abkhazia and south ossetia against genocide by the war criminal georgian president mikheil saakashvili
8546503 saakashvili is totally militarized and brought in outside support washington gave them all of the weapons and it has started to give weapons to the war criminal again
8546504 russia waited for 20 years to accept south ossetia and abkhazia south ossetia and abkhazia never lived together with independent georgia never the question is how many years should we wait russia now has to make a new course a new policy
8546505 if the u s and britain think they are first level countries and russia a second level country we dont agree
8546506 we are the first sort if you recognize that kosovo is an independent country fine we will do the same with other countries
8546507 this is a strong message to everybody those who think that aggression against russia is okay should know that there will be a strong response
8546508 the west is very much afraid of the militarization of russia they are afraid russia will solve its problems the way it did in south ossetia through military strength
8546509 we know there is a huge difference between the e u and the u s
8546510 we know that the bush administration is working for the election of john mccain
8546511 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8546512 isolation is not feasible russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8546513 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts
8546514 from our point of view this would be absolutely adequate response to what is happening in georgia
8546515 russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region
8546516 considering its actions in the falkland islands which are on the other side of the world
8546517 in all international institutions we will need to review our relations with russia
8546518 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8546519 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8546520 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8546521 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8546522 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8546523 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8546524 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8546525 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8546526 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8546527 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8546528 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8546529 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8546530 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8546531 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8546532 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8546533 i have had a stroke and i have trouble talking so that you can understand me i also sometimes have trouble reading or writing
8546534 i hope this mans heroism will inspire other victims to come forward
8546535 i asked jurors to punch the belleville diocese with a right hook
8546536 a great event and i did enjoyed it very much and would like to share with you sorry with resolution i use my small camera
8546537 when i saw his face ya rasulullah the serene nur reflected on his face i wondered how it would be like to see your face ya rasulullah when i saw his smile ya rasulullah so sweet and peaceful i wondered how it would be like to see your smile ya rasulullah
8546538 through the course of discussion their story started to unravel
8546539 all parties had moved into the apartment sunday night and probably knew each other for less than a half hour
8546540 there was no argument wrestling or struggle that precipitated this it just happened
8546541 its never happened in the 45 year history of the college and we have zero tolerance for violations of this sort
8546542 you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
8546543 russia today a news channel set up in april 2005 is broadcasting in english and arabic and planning to expand into spanish at first glance it looks a lot like cnn but it can be a breathless cheerleader for the kremlin
8546544 abkhazia and southern ossetia have been part of russia for hundreds of years
8546545 i want to thank the russian troops for bringing us to saf
8546546 georgias military was also trained and funded by the us and israel
8546547 a search of the address in derbyshire is under way and is expected to take several days
8546548 the whole focus of the bill was to protect taxpayers and i would hope the local taxing districts would also be interested in protecting taxpayers
8546549 persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages
8546550 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8546551 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study
8546552 essential we develop a coherent strategy to deal with population growth
8546553 this strategy must bring together policy on issues from the family to border control housing to skills and planning to immigration control
8546554 we not only need to ensure that our population grows at a more sustainable rate but that we also prepare properly for that sustainable rate of growth
8546555 the government have shown that they have no answers to the challenges we face by failing to plan for our increasing population this makes them part of the problem not the solution
8546556 population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the uk in the last few years the level is high so the prediction will be high
8546557 there are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off if you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 i think it would be different
8546558 most of us never think of these situations happening to us but its a whole new world and new way of thinking when it does
8546559 and right now if people need to make their home accessible its very costly and something many cant afford so their loved one ends up in a nursing home or some other facility
8546560 it would have been wonderful all those nights i laid awake to be able to walk across the parking lot to come in and check on him
8546561 there would be other parents in the same situation were in and it helps to talk to others
8546562 we want to teach them how to go to the store and the movies so they dont feel stuck
8546563 but im really thinking to myself how am i going to do this

8546569 more knowledge of the parameters that determine the stability of these emulsions besides interfacial tension solubility and density difference might lead to better control of the emulsification process
8546570 it is difficult to establish ideal experimental conditions to study how neurons react to growth signals because so much is happening at once that sorting out nerve cell connections is hard but the chip designed by experts in both brain chemistry and engineering offers a sophisticated way to sort things out
8546571 the ability to combine several different stimuli in the chip resembles a more realistic environment that nerve cells will encounter in the living animal
8546572 we extensively worked on poly unsaturated hydrocarbon chain containing polymers oils to devise a novel approach to nanoparticle formation
8546573 the simplicity of the process and economics should allow us to commercialize these paints as a versatile coating material for health and environmental applications
8546574 this provocative finding raised the question of a cause or effect phenomenon does cardiorespiratory fitness attenuate nafld or does increasing nafld severity result in a decline in cardiorespiratory fitness
8546575 despite our study limitations we believe the objective demonstration of low cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength with a high incidence of obesity illustrates the potential clinical relevance of these measures both before and after interventions
8546576 it would appear rational and prudent for healthcare providers to recommend exercise training to improve health related fitness as an integral role in the care of patients with nafld
8546577 visually evaluating the atrophy of the hippocampus is not only difficult and prone to subjectivity it is time consuming as a result it hasnt become part of clinical routine
8546578 the performance of automated segmentation is not only similar to that of the manual method it is much faster it can be performed within a few minutes versus an hour
8546579 combined with other clinical and neurospychological evaluations automated segmentation of the hippocampus on mr images can contribute to a more accurate diagnosis of alzheimers disease
8546580 these findings show the first direct links between the state of a neighbourhood and levels of functioning among its middle aged and older residents
8546581 though other people are looking for the mangoes they are dammyas he whose they are should eat and die

8546583 believe me though i pass away my bones in my tomb will give you hope and confidence
8546584 we focused on this gene for two reasons first it codes for the tau protein that we find in neurofibrillary tangles and secondly some studies in the scientific literature show an association between the gene and alzheimers disease while others do not even a study from our own group had found no association between tau gene variants and alzheimers disease
8546585 its not uncommon for us to determine that an older person is fully intact mentally only to find the presence of substantial alzheimers pathology on examining that persons brain after death we suspect that alzheimer lesions may be present in the brain long before we can detect any clinical symptoms
8546586 a particular form of amyloid beta called amyloid beta 42 tends to be higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of normal individuals and lower in patients with alzheimers disease and in cognitively normal people who have amyloid plaques in the brain tau protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid increase when a person starts developing dementia
8546587 by employing carbon nanotube technology we can not only come very close to existing skin characteristics we may even exceed them
8546588 furthermore the carbon in nanotubes is biocompatible meaning the bodys immune system does not recognize it as a foreign object in the future this will help to create sensors wired to a persons nervous system allowing information to flow back and forth to the brain

8546610 children are even more likely than adults to fall from the golf cart and these falls are associated with higher rates of head and neck injuries and hospitalizations greater efforts are needed to prevent these injuries
8546611 because golf carts are not designed for children and the majority offer no child safety features we recommend that children under the age of 6 years not be transported in golf carts and that drivers be at least 16 years old to operate the vehicle
8546612 following a few safety precautions such as driving at a reasonable speed wearing seat belts when they are available braking slowly and considering the terrain and weather conditions can reduce the potential for injuries
8546613 we appreciate that its not always easy being green but its up to all of us to become part of the solution in helping combat climate change he added
8546614 there has been a sea change on maternity leave and flexible work and we welcome that
8546615 but the effect has been to reinforce some traditional patterns the work and families act has not freed parents and given them real choice
8546616 it is based on assumptions and some of the terms reinforce the traditional pattern of women as the carers of children
8546617 the thing i worry about is that the current legislation and regulations have had the unintended consequence of making women a less attractive prospect to employers
8546618 the way it is framed means it is up to the women to transfer the leave to the man it is not his right
8546619 once when i sat at his feet along with many others i had two questions in my mind and he gave answers to both

8546623 one of the things that he insists is that we breathe deeply and we laugh love laugh and breathe are his three words
8546624 im a very creative right brained person so this must be just me imposing my imagination on situations
8546625 she kept saying mom the angels say you can do this youre just not
8546626 hes a person that i had admired since i was a little kid my mom had a big huge admiration for padre pio we followed his history a lot
8546627 i revered this man i put him on a pedestal a big pedestal
8546628 so one day i said to him how come me
8546629 it just came through my arm i didnt think i was hearing anything but my hand would keep writing which was a really strange feeling for me
8546630 but then i couldnt go fast enough and when i transferred to the computer all of a sudden it was a different sensation and i find it very difficult to describe its not hearing but its like if i looked at you and could tell what you are thinking
8546631 he says you know i think you could let him speak through you
8546632 and im using telling as a verb because i dont know what else to say
8546633 he was blessing and incensing the west and the east and all that and i hear this voice say tell him just to get on with it
8546634 he really looks forward to it because he misses her so dreadfully
8546635 all presidential elections are a reflection of the way the world is at the moment they all speak of change
8546636 so if youre looking for change you have a wide path they are all having their plans their paths which one do you feel comfortable with that my brother is your choice and i cannot tell you that
8546637 but do know that there was no accident that there was a female within this because her purpose was to open the awareness of the line of the females of the path of the females not her particularly but the path of a female that nurturing that love aspect that is part of what goes along with the term female
8546638 the priest abuse and some of the other things that is not making the church a bad or a good place the way it will work is how it is handled and in those dioceses where it is being handled openly and with compassion and with care and explanation and openness i think those parishes and that church there will be very strong
8546639 including those who perpetrated this particular incident they didnt have their 21 virgins in their party but they were celebrated for three days in partying and love and acceptance because they did what they thought they were supposed to do
8546640 if you have no more questions i greet you once more and ask you to be open to be aware and i ask you to laugh because laughter is so wonderful and to love and to breathe deeply often during the day and i withdraw
8546641 more and more kids are coming to me who are hearing voices or who are seeing spirits some of them both and lately ive asked him padre pio if this is an area that im being directed towards and he said absolutely
8546642 we do 15 mins on the bike 15 on the elliptical 15 on the treadmill 1000 metres on the rowing machine were building that up slowly because we hate it

8546646 for me my mandarin is no good i can understand but when i speak people find it hard to listen my english is even worse no choice now have to work harder and practise speaking mandarin la have to earn a living lah
8546647 yeah it would be great if cashiers could make 25 per hour but it would drive prices through the roof
8546648 were proud to announce news that our online gaming company has devised new algorithms and computer models for enhanced online gaming analysis
8546649 and as a result were expecting nearly double last quarters profits in the coming months
8546650 and were happy to also announce our own software team has developed important online gaming production algorithms that will boost our profits dramaticly
8546651 mostly because well need time to train these employees to be as effective online gaming producers as possible
8546652 on more than just one level as a reporter its a great story and as a citizen of veta trotta borough i know that my neighbors will still have their jobs one has to realize that this will only strengthen the local economy and drive new business to our area these factors are key to economic survival and to my fellow citizens as we move forward in the next few years
8546653 id like to personally thank vesely safer and valenzuela blackett for the work theyve done on this project
8546654 without their efforts our company would need be able to meet the demands of the burgeoning consumer market when demand increases the only way to provide for this change is an increase in technology most importantly we wont be laying anyone off all current employees in our priddy beaudette county plant and all online gaming project employees will be guaranteed employment for 3 years
8546655 we chose to use perl in our online gaming text studies because it is a lingual programming language
8546656 and also because it is easy to combine with other programming languages perl is easily installed on linux platforms and modules can be compiled that allow us to communicate with database technologies
8546657 with increased profits well be able to hire more employees and really grow our business
8546658 well be hiring more workers within the next 6 months why because while some jobs will be made redundant in the new profit model we can take the talents of these valuable employees and parlay them into other equally paying jobs within our corporate structure
8546659 were excited to learn that over 1000 new jobs will be created
8546660 the mall traffic is ok but not very high quality now with over 1000 new people visiting each day business will surely skyrocket
8546661 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
8546662 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
8546663 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
8546664 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
8546665 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements

8546670 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is under way against all 18 individuals
8546671 notwithstanding the numbers involved in this single unprecedented incident which is being treated very seriously it has not affected the ships ability to do its job
8546672 i have deep respect and appreciation for the civil rights movement
8546673 but far too many of that generation whove been in office far too long have a sense of entitlement and privilege
8546674 this is someone who is completely disengaged from and invisible in the community
8546675 hes never been elected to the school board or even attended a pta meeting he has no idea how these things really work
8546676 i am playing as essien for the npp with nana addo playing as stephen appiah in a match between ndc and npp there is no way npp would be defeated in the december elections
8546677 rawlings has done some before and we know he can do it again this time so ghanaians should watch out
8546678 women are the best economists in the world and contribute to all spheres of life
8546679 because there is no sea in the ashanti region president kufuor does not see the need to pay attention to the plight of fishermen
8546680 i think that because he knows so much and yet hes finding it difficult to hold himself to the high standard that is expected of him hes becoming a danger to society
8546681 where the ndc seems set to take us back to
8546682 people considered to be good discarding moral values and the greater national interest for parochial gains
8546683 these are very tribalistic statements atta mills hides behind asomdwoehene and plays the tribal card he should come out and deny or confirm making these statements
8546684 and that would be rather unfortunate in an election year when ghanaians need to eschew tribalism and live together as one people with a common destiny
8546685 the business community will need a business paper that gives accurate business information facts figures unbiased analysis and realistic conclusions to help it predict business trends accurately
8546686 i am proud to say as the finance minister that from gh 300 000 in 2004 the company has progressively increased its profitability such that it was able to pay gh 800 000 as dividend to the state for 2007 financial year
8546687 all of us owe the nation a great responsibility to help consolidate our democracy
8546688 there is no law in the musiga constitution banning any musician from joining a political party of his or her choice
8546689 a man who was born with a golden spoon yet fought for people who were not born with even wooden spoons so that they might get at least bronze spoons
8546690 i believe nana addo is the best person to move ghana forward into a modern state with a modern economy he loves ghana and believes in ghana else he had no business going out there on a kumepreko demonstration for the ordinary ghanaian
8546691 music and politics go hand in hand and you can not have a political campaign without music
8546692 our songs have been used over the years during political campaigns and there is nothing wrong with that in fact they can contract people to even compose for them but in doing these duties the musician should know how to handle such issues
8546693 the union itself is non partisan and we do not tread on peoples rights so our members can do what is best for them so far as it does not hamper their career we have no problem with it at all
8546694 i have said this before and i am going to repeat it issues like this do not come up for discussions in civilized societies like america where people go from film actors to governors
8546695 in america opra winfrey did not only stand on stage with barrack obama to endorse him but also gave him 25 million to push his campaign
8546696 when we compare ourselves to america then people say we have not reached there yet but when it comes to dressing like americans then we say we have reached there
8546697 we dress to expose our panties and all that in the name of copying america but when it comes to serious issues of deciding who should be given the mandate to govern us then we say we have not reached there
8546698 i would be calling on all my fans to vote for nana akufo addo to win the elections because he is the best person for ghana
8546699 since morning i havent sold any of the ndc supplies but without much stress i have sold more than 20 of the ruling partys and im hoping to sell more by evening time
8546700 life has been good since i started selling these souvenirs because now i make a little money everyday
8546701 i didnt understand why all the white people who came to me bought only npp paraphernalia so i asked one of them who told me that it was because of the sparkling nature of the ruling partys colours
8546702 because my colleagues and i do not have money to buy the items straight away from the lady we sell the supplies on commission basis

8546768 the destructive and divisive communal forces have to be stopped we want this message to go across to people that is why we are closing our educational institutions in deep sorrow and anguish we hope parents become aware of the implications of the incidents in orissa
8546769 the central government has failed to check violence in orissa it is only after five days of violence and atrocities on christians that extra forces are being rushed

8546776 with the team concentrating on set up evaluations ahead of the race here in a couple of weekends time we experienced no major problems and nico will continue testing tomorrow
8546777 today we tried to get a good set up for the rest of the test and the race in just a couple of weeks time
8546778 and i think we can be happy with how it went today this morning the grip levels were very low and it was quite difficult with the tyres we had and especially as i had not been in the car for some time for a real test we did make some good progress though almost 100 laps with no problems and we are not too far from the others in the times either
8546779 we also conducted some work on engine mapping brake testing and tyre evaluation grip levels are low at the moment and the tyres we are using are very hard for the conditions but everyone has the same issue so we will work over the next days to optimise the performance overall we had a good day and are pretty happy with the information we gathered its been a good start to the test
8546780 the cars feel is very important at because you are trying to run with as little drag as possible so you do not have as much downforce as at other circuits
8546781 we had a delay at the beginning of the day but then we concentrated on brake work as well as trying the car with different levels of downforce and evaluating the bridgestone tyre compounds that we will use in the italian grand prix in the end i did more than 90 laps and we collected a lot of information to continue the test tomorrow
8546782 it was not the ideal start this morning due to a short delay
8546783 but when we started running everything went well we had to make some mechanical alterations which we have to analyse back in cologne in the afternoon we caught up with our programme with the emphasis on suspension data collection and other test items we were not aiming to set fast lap times but we are in a good position to make further progress with jarno tomorrow before timo takes over for the final day of the test on friday
8546784 and nice to complete so many laps its the fastest circuit of the year and so we were trying out our low downforce package which went well although it always feels strange to drive with such little downforce on the car the track was also quite green which didnt help but i was happy with the set up work we completed even though we still have a lot to learn
8546785 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8546786 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change
8546787 if you had cancer and a very expensive cancer drug that you would have to pay for could treat your cancer would you expect your doctor to tell you about this new drug
8546788 in developed world countries like australia new zealand canada italy usa amp uk people trust their doctors and are keen to be made aware of any new cancer drugs that may assist their recovery no matter the cost
8546789 in countries that have less developed medical infrastructure like ukraine uruguay mexico and china people are more hesitant to place their trust in their doctors and the low number of people in these countries that want their doctor to keep them informed shows the lack of investment in an efficient and reliable health system
8546790 if you had cancer and a very expensive cancer drug that you would have to pay for could treat your cancer would you expect your doctor to tell you about this new drug
8546791 the question is how are we going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8546792 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8546793 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8546794 we need 100bn plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment
8546795 i thought we both drank too much and i wanted him to cut back
8546796 every time i drink a little too much i become depressed i feel compelled to drink when im sad im sad when i drink and after maybe one too many drinks when i begin to feel sick when i can begin to admit to emotions ive already harbored i could stop but i dont want to and if i didnt have this drink limit i wouldnt
8546797 i poured myself two glasses of wine with erika the first glass wasnt a full glass i could consider it half a glass the second glass i fell asleep before finishing i could technically count tonight as a single glass of wine and erika would take my side
8546798 it is unlikely that erika will ever mention to christy joanne tyler or charles that i drank with her on monday to them this is my first drink this week
8546799 if i consider the fact that ive only had two drinks this week i could have two tonight but ill probably want more maybe i should talk to loc about making an exception
8546800 i have a drink limit because i have a habit of drinking when i am sad or after drinking i often become irrationally sad

8546810 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
8546811 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
8546812 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home
8546813 above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
8546814 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8546815 the court finds no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible
8546816 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less than scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8546817 we are very happy that the judge in this case recognized our compliance with the dmca and our efforts to respect copyrights
8546818 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8546819 earlier this year we notified pre press staff of a review of our operations within hampshire which included an upgrade to our production system and proposals to transfer the majority of our advertisement make up to a third party supplier
8546820 plans to upgrade the production system are already under way while investigation into outsourcing of advertisement make up including the successful implementation of similar projects elsewhere within newsquest and gannett centres has resulted in us being confident that similar efficiencies can be achieved within the hampshire region
8546821 consequently it is envisaged that we will be able to operate our pre press function with fewer staff
8546822 it is therefore proposed that the pre press operations in both basingstoke and southampton will be consolidated into a single unit based in southampton
8546823 our hope is that the proposed redundancies can be achieved on a voluntary basis
8546824 the economic environment we are facing is very challenging but by making these changes we feel better able to respond to those challenges whilst still focusing on our ambitions of growing our newspaper sales online audiences and profits
8546825 we want to refocus our marketing efforts into growing audiences for our advertisers
8546826 this involves selling more papers helping to promote our branded and classified websites and building up our databases to help our ad sales teams become more successful
8546827 we will still be running lots of reader travel and competitions in our papers
8546828 we will also still be attending all the major events and shows across our region as well as organising and hosting our important awards
8546829 la libert un ideale quando non c ci manca tutto e quando c non ci curiamo di preservarla luomo ha certamente coscienza spontanea ed immediata della propria libert ma questa intesa in senso forte come effettiva possibilit di scegliere consapevolmente tra alternative diverse richiede che luomo stesso si differenzi dal resto della natura che luomo abbia piena contezza di s e si gestisca di conseguenza che luomo non scenda a patti con i livelli pi bassi dellesistenza e sappia riscattarsi anche dalle disavventure pi gravi luomo unit di corpo e di spirito che non pu abdicare ad una parte consistente di s senza pagare pesantemente dazio

8546871 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense it s not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signalling at dawn and dusk
8546872 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8546873 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night if in the morning a bird doesn t hear its neighbour or an anole doesn t see its neighbour it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8546874 all of these behaviors are displays of physical vigor as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive

8546972 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8546973 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8546974 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8546975 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8546976 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8546977 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8546978 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8546979 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8546980 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8546981 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8546982 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8546983 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8546984 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8546985 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8546986 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8546987 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8546988 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8546989 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8546990 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8546991 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8546992 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8546993 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8546994 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8546995 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8546996 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8546997 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8546998 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8546999 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8547000 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8547001 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8547002 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8547003 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8547004 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8547005 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8547006 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8547007 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8547008 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8547009 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8547010 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8547011 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8547012 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8547013 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8547014 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8547015 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8547016 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8547017 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8547018 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8547019 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8547020 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8547021 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8547022 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8547023 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8547024 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8547025 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8547026 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8547027 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8547028 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8547029 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8547030 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8547031 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8547032 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8547033 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8547034 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8547035 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8547036 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8547037 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8547038 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8547039 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8547040 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8547041 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8547042 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8547043 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8547057 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8547058 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8547059 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8547060 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8547061 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8547062 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8547063 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8547091 as the police have so far shown restraint and resisted efforts to disperse the crowd by force and shoulder the consequences the pad is pinning its hopes on some men in green sharing its goal of toppling the government

8547169 the way we played tonight i feel like this team is relaxed and ready
8547170 they know what they have to do now and i believe in them
8547171 my changeup was good all night except for the one that spiked past the catcher and gave them the lead other than that i think i was alright
8547172 i got a changeup i was able to hit over the second basemans head and get us the lead

8547190 i met hillary even shook her hand at a book signing about 10 years ago
8547191 she was really nice but i always vote based on the quality of the person not by the shade of their skin
8547192 black people got a bad rap when our votes shifted to barack that it was all race pride that flies in the face of the facts which is that blacks at the beginning of the year supported hillary by 3 1 it makes me angry because it is dismissive and perpetuates stereotypes we are trying to explode as a party
8547193 they get to vote for someone who reflects the world as they live in and see it they do not carry the racial baggage that my generation carries when obama speaks of looking past racial class and gender divisions hes talking about the world they already live in
8547194 i thought i would see in my lifetime a black man be nominated for president but that that would be the end of the road
8547195 we are praying that this is not it but the general indicators are questionable
8547196 there is a strong undercurrent of hesitation about this candidacy out there because of this big fear
8547197 it is rarely spoken of but i think its real it is a sad statement
8547198 i came to denver because this is an historical event and while i am still very cynical about this country and the world i think senator obamas nomination is different for younger people
8547199 my mom went to segregated schools and lived that life for her it is a stretch to see a black man running the country
8547200 for me i have always seen black people in positions of power so it is different for me

8547211 our whole purpose is to make sure the unit is as safe as possible
8547212 we know we could be the patient who gets the blood
8547213 a trauma arises or somebody gets into difficulty post surgery or a baby is born and needs transfusion support that can happen at any time day or night
8547214 what we do in canada is say we know that listeria is ubiquitous that it will be in processing plants regardless of what preventative standards we have intact
8547215 once it listeria becomes established in a processing environment its very difficult to remove
8547216 you can reduce numbers to low levels by sanitation and good practices but its hard to eradicate
8547217 any time they find one listeria in the food processing plant they are going to recall a product theres a problem with that
8547218 if every time you get a positive test you get a recall youre going to reduce testing for it to the bare minimum
8547219 if you have to start issuing a recall after recall after recall the fact is you start to decrease consumer confidence
8547220 something that you thought was not curable and not treatable you may be able to actually change
8547221 it will certainly encourage lots of researchers to use dopamine drugs in clinical trials
8547222 its not all of it but its a big chunk of it
8547223 you think oh my god mentally challenged sheltered work environment for the rest of their lives are they going to get married can they go to school can they take care of themselves
8547224 all those images you have of your hopes and aspirations theyre gone its like a death
8547225 dopamine is still being released in patients dopamine still binds to the receptor but nothing is going on after that
8547226 will hold and test 100 per cent of the product coming off the lines for four to six weeks
8547227 having been subjected to three or four complete chemical wash downs theres very little doubt that theres any listeria there left
8547228 of course it can come back at a moments notice on someones shoes on someones hand it can be brought back into the plant the day after we say everything is good
8547229 thats not true about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of its scientific in nature test results
8547230 the review of results from testing the review of records the review of the cooking temperatures employed in a plant in my view are fundamental to demonstrating that the processes being employed by the plant are in control
8547231 that scientific review demonstrates the safety and security of the entire process used to produce a food
8547232 while this is the most unfortunate of events possible i absolutely do not believe that this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators certainly knowing that there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops right here
8547233 if you had a box of cereal and you took one tablespoon of cereal out of that box you would more than likely get a negative result even though a bacteria may exist at the bottom of the box
8547234 its like looking for a needle in a hay stack
8547235 but there are no regulations its important to stress that they the companies are regulated to ensure that listeria is not present in the product but its up to the producer to devise a sampling plan that they think would meet the government regulation
8547236 we have increased the number of regulators but we also do rely on the companies themselves it has to be a joint effort there has to be a shared responsibility

8547249 people were aware of various forcing mechanisms the ice age cycle co2 warming aerosol cooling but didnt know which would be dominant in the near future by the end of the 1970s though it had become clear that co2 warming would probably be dominant that conclusion has subsequently strengthened

8547321 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8547322 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8547323 users are unable to access malaysia today through three major isps tmnet maxis and time however users can still access
8547324 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8547325 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8547326 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8547327 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8547328 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8547329 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8547330 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8547331 i have deep respect and appreciation for the civil rights movement
8547332 but far too many of that generation whove been in office far too long have a sense of entitlement and privilege
8547333 this is someone who is completely disengaged from and invisible in the community
8547334 hes never been elected to the school board or even attended a pta meeting he has no idea how these things really work
8547335 i think he has potential if he continues this run
8547336 he represents a kind of next phase of young politics not only in this district but nationwide
8547337 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccain s own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before you re against it
8547338 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself and what s more senator mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear well not this year not this time the rove mccain tactics are old and outworn and america will reject them in 2008
8547339 the mccain bush republicans have been wrong again and again and again and they know they will lose on the issues so the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8547340 how insulting to suggest that those who question the mission question the troops how pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt america itself how desperate to tell the son of a single mother who chose community service over money and privilege that he doesn t put america first

8547342 im pleased to see the week has been a success and has been well attended by residents in the surrounding communities
8547343 the young people that came along seemed to really enjoy the football and bmx and skateboard ramps the week of fun is intended to build on the success of the previous action week which focussed on an environmental theme held in march of this year these events allow us to talk to customers in creative and fun ways and receive important feedback about our services
8547344 ive had loads of fun and i love riding my bmx bike its a really good idea to set up the bmx ramps and i think it is something that should be done in every park
8547345 i especially like the biggest ramp as i can jump quite high on that
8547346 we often speak about older people being isolated from public transport if they live in rural areas but it can be just as much of a problem in the city
8547347 if you cant physically get to your local bus stop then it doesnt matter how good the service is
8547348 weve got two key generations the baby boomers and todays teenagers who see public transport as a second class means of getting around
8547349 unless something is done to address these attitudes bus passenger numbers will continue to fall and well see a further decline in investment in those services
8547350 the main objective of a local authority is to get as many people as possible on conventional public transport as this is the cheapest option and keeps commercial operators in business
8547351 however different people have different needs and it is increasingly recognised that the one size fits all approach just doesnt work
8547352 we should be asking people what they need this will vary from county to county between cities and even within cities
8547353 local authorities and operators can then decide how best to use their resources
8547354 its not just about cost as many older people are more than willing to pay towards transport that meets their needs but they do need more practical assistance
8547355 its also a social occasion for people who live on their own
8547356 during the consultation process around removing unprofitable payphones a number of suggestions have been voiced by local people and local government
8547357 we have listened to these suggestions and can now confirm that local authorities that wish to maintain red telephone boxes minus the telephone equipment for aesthetic or heritage reasons will able to do so
8547358 in addition local authorities that have requested to contribute to maintenance costs to retain a red telephone box with a working telephone will also be accommodated

8547361 create a green pathway out of poverty is you line up your green job seekers with your green job trainers with your green job creators
8547362 a green economy strong enough to lift people out of poverty
8547363 from the point of view of planetary survival every job needs to be a green job
8547364 there will be a need to focus much more on math and science and the need for technological innovation and invention were focused on those young people who may not have college in their future we want to make sure that we bring back vocational arts we see a need for vocational skills training a need for a well paid green collar workforce in the united states that can install solar panels weatherize retrofit buildings do rainwater management and construct buildings that are smarter with regard to energy and water we think that the sooner those values get inculcated in young people the better off well be
8547365 weve been using our school systems all the way through college to train people for the pollution based jobs of the last century
8547366 there needs to be a sea change in our educational system to get people prepared for a world where frankly theres going to be a lot more resource competition and resource scarcity and were going to have to be much smarter and more conscious about how we produce and consume
8547367 if you look at these extreme weather events at the coming water shortages at the lack of investment in our infrastructure over the past thirty years you see theres going to be an enormous labor demand for skilled vocational work and the people doing it are going to be the heroes who build rebuild retrofit and reboot this country
8547368 we should tell students this from the beginning its a huge opportunity to make a good living but also to make a big difference in your country
8547369 im a civil rights lawyer i come out of that background and martin luther king jr fought and died to racially integrate a pollution based economy
8547370 i think we have a moral obligation in the new century to make sure that the new clean green economy includes everybody from the beginning
8547371 she helped us get into title x of an energy bill a provision called the green jobs act of 2007 president george w bush signed it into law in december
8547372 enough money to train about 30 000 people a year every year in the green trades and 20 percent of those dollars are to be directed toward at risk folks people with barriers to employment
8547373 all across the country you have all this work that needs to be done and you have all these people who need work why dont we connect the people who most need work with the work that most needs to get done
8547374 yes i have the best education in the world disastrous failure at trying to get stuff done

8547385 every year we have 4 million high school students who take general biology and it may be the last biology course they ever take
8547386 if half of them get a contorted or watered down version of evolution then thats a big number these students will go on to sit on school boards and vote in elections
8547387 as scientists we also should make it our responsibility to present the evidence for biological evolution to all of our students especially in introductory courses most students who enroll in our introductory courses will use them as their terminal courses in science at least some of those students will go on to careers as teachers or as public servants who will be asked to make decisions about whether to allow nonscientific approaches to teaching evolution to appear in science curricula
8547388 evolution is one of the most powerful explanations of connectedness we have it provides logic and sense to so much of biology
8547389 high school students who carry a poor or no understanding of evolution into college are less likely to pick careers in the biological and geological sciences the result is fewer scientists
8547390 any statement about lifes origins should be considered as theory not fact
8547391 too often evolution is taught just as a topic not as a repeating theme of biology
8547392 students believe that just because they cant see evolution in action it doesnt exist look the actors on csi a popular television series about solving gruesome murders use evidence to solve an unseen crime there is evidence of evolution all over science
8547393 seen in the light of evolution biology is perhaps intellectually the most satisfying and inspiring science without that light it becomes a pile of sundry facts some of them interesting or curious but making no meaningful picture as a whole
8547394 this is how we were created and you have to believe it on faith

8547413 robinho continues being a real madrid player and the coach counts on him
8547414 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8547415 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8547416 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8547417 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8547418 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8547419 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8547420 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused
8547421 if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final
8547422 but i dont believe the question about an appeal has ever been raised

8547472 there is no question of launching an all out war with russia
8547473 no one ever doubted that a russian army of up to 800 000 people was going to defeat a georgian army of up to 18 000 people
8547474 indeed that has happened over the last two weeks the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that

8547522 he was told every year that somebody falls through the cracks and youre the kid who fell through the cracks
8547523 i had no partial scholarship offers to any d ii schools no one really wanted me i had no offers anywhere or for anything the main reason i came here is they were the most honest with me they didnt lie to me at all they told me the whole time there was a chance id have a scholarship but probably not when it came down to it i thought id take somebody with good integrity and they were always honest with me
8547524 fast improving and should be a three or four star player by the end of the year his coach and several other area coaches rave about robs ability and potential a disruptive force on the defense he can penetrate and shows good change of direction
8547525 the big thing here for me was to come in and try to play and perform to the best of my abilities and try to maximize my potential as a player
8547526 if they want to give me a scholarship thats fine if they want to play me thatd be even better
8547527 of course you want all that stuff in high school
8547528 you want to be highly recruited but i would not change anything for the world maybe if a school like uni came through with a partial scholarship i probably wouldve gone there to tell you the truth looking back on it now im extremely happy with my decision i love this place love the people and i couldnt have asked for a better situation really
8547529 we were going to do it anyway i had made up my mind
8547530 he got hurt there and i thought it would make him feel a little better to know he had earned a scholarship i didnt want him to think we were going to throw him to the curb
8547531 er zijn ongetwijfeld participatiemaatschappijen die dertig procent aanhouden als norm maar wij hebben daar geen vaste regel voor startende ondernemers kunnen niet altijd kapitaal inbrengen een eigen investering verdient natuurlijk wel onze voorkeur op die manier is het commitment van de ondernemer sterk aantoonbaar
8547532 dat geld kan gespaard zijn tijdens werk in loondienst uit een eerdere onderneming komen of aangetrokken zijn uit de familie en vriendenkring een eigen huis als onderpand gebruiken raden wij af we zijn flexibel en besluiten bijvoorbeeld samen met een ondernemer dat hij het eerste halfjaar geen inkomen geniet dat is ook eigen inbreng
8547533 nee dat verschilt per branche soms zijn enkele tonnen nodig soms miljoenen in relatief kleine participaties gaat het om anderhalf tot twee ton waarvan de starter bijvoorbeeld 25 000 euro zelf inlegt
8547534 we adviseren ondernemers om een besloten vennootschap op te richten in een eenmanszaak is iemand priv aansprakelijk en als participant ben je dan aan de goden overgeleverd in het allerslechtste geval gaat iemand er met het geld vandoor
8547535 we raden aan een tijd geen dividend op te nemen een bittere pil voor de ondernemer maar nodig als je wilt dat een bedrijf wat vlees op de botten krijgt afhankelijk van het businessplan de marktomstandigheden en bestaande resultaten financieren we de groei graag vanuit het bedrijf en met inbreng van de ondernemer die laat daarmee zien dat hij gelooft in zijn product bedrijf en concept ook doorstarters financieren we bijvoorbeeld ondernemers die met een investering van vrienden startten maar geen additionele liquiditeiten kunnen krijgen we onderhandelen dan met hen over bij investeren en verdelen van aandelen in beginsel is bij ons alles mogelijk

8547539 if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right
8547540 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8547541 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8547542 in francophone regions outside of montreal and quebec city its 35 for the conservatives and 33 for the bloc which means the conservatives have the opportunity to make gains

8547544 simply thinking of a conservative majority sends a chill down the spine

8547546 there was an escape plan we dont know whether that intelligence came from staff or inmates we do know it went all the way up the chain of command all the way to the executive director of correctional operations
8547547 there was lots of rumble out there that something was going to happen
8547548 what happened was the inmates refused to co operate with staff when they were trying to enter the unit so it took some time for staff to get into the unit and then clear the inmates out it wasnt a riot it was more unco operative in nature
8547549 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened

8547553 als de verschillende vn organisaties meer samen zouden werken zouden ze veel beter in kaart kunnen brengen welke plekken er wel of geen hulp hebben nu zie je dat vooral op het platteland hulp ontbreekt en dat er rond sommige steden genoeg is mensen trekken nu van het platteland naar de stad op zoek naar hulp

8547572 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8547573 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8547574 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8547575 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8547576 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator south africann president thabo mbeki about the breaches that have occurred
8547577 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8547578 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse

8547596 on the whole we are selective about the projects we take on clients turn to us first for our reputation and intelligence on global investors and end users secondly for our track record of successfully syndicating the sales and marketing process to generate returns we know how to attract and track leads for developers and sales groups it is very unusual to find this mix of expertise under one roof

8547602 i dunno but i was just humming it a few minutes ago
8547603 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8547604 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8547605 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8547606 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8547607 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8547608 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8547609 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8547610 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8547611 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
8547612 our studies have shown that diazepam also affects the dopamine system which adds a new positive reinforcement mechanism of reward learning to the theory of benzodiazepine addiction
8547613 from this nationally representative telephone survey we estimate that more than 4 3 million u s adults are taking opioids regularly in any given week
8547614 the extent and characteristics of opioid use among u s adults reflected in this study reinforces the need to strike a rational balance between opioid misuse and effective control of chronic pain
8547615 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8547616 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8547617 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8547618 in order for us to create treatments that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants

8547625 the number of expensive physical models and prototypes can be radically reduced by cave and this ultimately saves a lot of time and money
8547626 furthermore the development process is significantly accelerated after all as designers we are working in 3 d anyway the new technology enables us to immediately discuss the different proposals and ideas with our colleagues from engineering or marketing and try things out
8547627 cave creates a quite different form of communication and cooperation marketers designers and engineers can now deal with one issue simultaneously regardless of what comes up with me as a designer or engineer i am able to immediately try it and see if it works as everyone is seeing the same thing those people who are not directly involved in the process of development and construction can also immediately see the consequences and effects of decisions
8547628 in this respect our innovative strength will also increase it has become much easier to try out something crazy in between
8547629 our good reputation is essentially determined by our design this has always been so and will remain this way we are simply improving now

8547646 the problem is they are speaking in so many different voices all the various components are expressing their own views and these are contradictory its really more a confusion than any kind of strategy
8547647 while you have these positive messages you also have the negative messages coming from leaders who feel the party their leader jacob zuma is under siege

8547696 as the long time editor in chief of muscle media magazine ive extensively researched and studied the effects of various fat loss agents and okumas wu long is far and away the best there is the research supporting okumas wu long is extensive and impressive myself ive noticed amazing results from using okumas wu long its the only fat burner i believe in and use accept no imitations there is a difference

8547698 im looking forward to ordering my next supply of wu long because it is making me feel good and its giving me lots of energy and its only my third day
8547699 ive only been using wu long for a week now and a pleasantly unexpected thing happened today i tried on a pair of pants that were rather snug fitting before using your tea im happy to report that they are not as tight as before this tea is amazing
8547700 i had such a hard time losing the weight after the birth of my daughter i then started drinking okumas wu long tea and the pounds just melted away i absolutely love this tea and the taste is wonderful perfect in the mornings and in the evenings i credit my winning a national beauty pageant partly to okumas wu long it works for me and i think it will work for you too
8547701 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8547702 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8547703 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8547704 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8547705 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8547706 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8547707 weve taken a unit of work and linked it all together
8547708 our aim is to make it make fun engaging and educational
8547709 my favourite experiment was the hovercraft where you use a balloon with a cd and they spin
8547710 our class has actually been doing science for some time
8547711 you have to sticky tape metal to metal and then the lights comes on like this
8547712 it really lets the kids construct their own understanding and age is no barrier to what they can do
8547713 its kids teaching kids and how to learn in kids language
8547714 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8547715 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8547716 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8547717 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8547718 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8547719 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8547720 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8547721 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8547722 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8547723 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8547724 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8547725 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8547726 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8547727 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8547728 we cannot remain a global industry leader without a strong presence in the high growth market of india
8547729 this will enable us to capture more opportunities in one of the fastest growing vehicle markets in the world
8547730 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk

8547735 good i dont think you really want to know all the details of that do you
8547736 i was really pleased because kuyt scored the winning goal
8547737 his effort is amazing every game we knew it could be difficult from the first minute they played well and we knew they would play well on the counterattack so we had to work really hard until the end
8547738 for me the most positive thing is that we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp and we scored at the end that means that the team are working really hard we had confidence and we kept pushing we knew from the first game they are really good and on wednesday they also played well they were always a threat because you know you can concede from a free kick or a corner we were going forward well and controlling the game but were missing the final pass to make the difference
8547739 pepe was the key player in the first game but today it is not about just one player it is about all of them
8547740 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8547741 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8547742 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8547743 because if he wins the world will be a dangerous place to live

8547749 i must have a thyroid problem im just so tired all the time
8547750 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of casino computer programmer volunteers and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes
8547751 and 50 cash is a nice gift i also added my name to the casino computer programmer volunteers studys contact list for future surveys interviews and any public discussions its a very interesting and important topic
8547752 usually i just sign off on results and make sure they are published in a timely matter but this time i really wanted to get hands on with this casino computer programmer volunteers subject matter so i decided to aide my fellow employees with statistical measurements and data analysis personally im very curious about local casino computer programmer volunteers ideas and trends
8547753 for those surveyees that took part in all three of the casino computer programmer volunteers survey sections we offered three different forms of compensation a cash gift of 50 gift certificate to a local restaurant or a gift card for the upcoming holiday season at the local mall
8547754 i was impressed with the publics awareness of casino computer programmer volunteers trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review
8547755 i loved the opportunity to meet and greet the casino computer programmer volunteers survey takers and speak to them one on one i want to get the most accurate and colorful data possible for my work also i want to get personal ideas and view points that will offer some important perspective about the level of casino computer programmer volunteers integration in our society
8547756 were really excited with the turn out for this important casino computer programmer volunteers data gathering study with other 1000 participants we will meet all quotas for a statistically significant sample which will guarantee the legitimacy of our casino computer programmer volunteers study data this is absolutely key to professors donald druckman and ritterbush wagoner who will be collating the results
8547757 residents appreciate the problems caused by inflation after all they are suffering too
8547758 with food inflation running at 9 per cent and fuel prices rising exponentially this is not the time for increases in costs but for a root and branch examination of all expenditure and management costs to see how councils across cambridgeshire can best help hard pressed pensioners and families
8547759 following the disastrous reorganisation four years ago it is probable we do not have an organisation that is fully effective there is duplication of activity there are inefficient processes and there is a top heavy organisation
8547760 it is unfortunate someone i see very regularly at shire hall has to resort to an open letter through the press rather than talking to me face to face
8547761 the conservative administration is determined to keep next years council tax to the absolute minimum but we need to be realistic
8547762 rising costs are affecting the council in the same way as everyone else
8547763 our money is not going as far this year as it did 12 months ago in addition we face an ever growing demand for services
8547764 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8547765 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8547766 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8547767 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8547768 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8547769 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8547770 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8547771 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8547772 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8547773 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8547774 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8547775 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8547776 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8547777 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8547778 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8547779 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8547780 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8547781 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8547782 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8547783 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8547784 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8547785 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8547786 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8547787 i wish i had know this before we had three
8547788 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8547789 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8547790 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8547791 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8547792 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8547793 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8547794 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8547795 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8547796 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8547797 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8547798 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8547799 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8547800 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8547801 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8547802 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8547803 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8547804 foreign countries are monitoring and keeping a close watch and waiting for a showdown
8547805 i assign police to do this task without forcibly dispersing the rally
8547806 we still maintain our goals one all parties have to commit that they will not amend the constitution at all two the government has to quit
8547807 at this moment there are more than 10 000 protesters inside
8547808 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8547809 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8547810 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8547811 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8547812 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8547813 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8547814 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8547815 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8547816 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8547817 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8547818 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8547819 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8547820 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8547821 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8547822 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8547823 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8547824 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8547825 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8547826 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8547827 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8547828 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8547829 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8547830 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8547831 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8547832 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8547833 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8547834 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8547835 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8547836 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8547837 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8547838 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8547839 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8547840 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8547841 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8547842 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8547843 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8547844 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8547845 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8547846 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8547847 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8547848 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8547849 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8547850 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8547851 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8547852 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8547853 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8547854 the ministers see the agreement as paving the way to enhancing the regions economic integration and acting as an impetus to deepen and broaden the trade and investment among the 12 participating countries
8547855 we are in very good shape in terms of the progress of the overall asean plus one process
8547856 we hope that this will lead toward a really greater east asia economic integration
8547857 im sure that this also will give some impetus some encouragement to the stalled doha round
8547858 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8547859 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8547860 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8547861 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8547862 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8547863 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8547864 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8547865 han talar om suget i sin kropp efter att r ra om om beg ret efter en viss f rg om musik i f rger med den vinr da f rgens hj lp kunde han redan d f rflytta sig in i kroppens inre delar
8547866 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8547867 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8547868 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8547869 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8547870 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8547871 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8547872 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8547873 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8547874 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8547875 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8547876 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8547877 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8547878 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8547879 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8547880 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8547881 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8547882 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8547883 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8547884 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8547885 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8547886 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8547887 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8547888 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8547889 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8547890 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8547891 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8547892 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8547893 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8547894 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8547895 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8547896 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8547897 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8547898 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8547899 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8547900 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8547901 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8547902 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8547903 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8547904 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8547905 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8547906 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8547907 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8547908 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8547909 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8547910 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8547911 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8547912 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8547913 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8547914 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8547915 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8547916 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8547917 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8547918 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8547919 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8547920 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8547921 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8547922 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8547923 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8547924 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8547925 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8547926 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8547927 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8547928 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8547929 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8547930 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8547931 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8547932 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8547933 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8547934 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8547935 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8547936 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8547937 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8547938 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8547939 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8547940 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8547941 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8547942 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8547943 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8547944 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8547945 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8547946 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8547947 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8547948 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8547949 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8547950 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8547951 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8547952 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8547953 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8547954 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead

8547957 microsoft corp and nikon corp have signed a patent cross licensing agreement to further the development of each companys current and future product lines the agreement covers digital cameras made by nikon as well as a broad range of other consumer products each company manufactures and sells microsoft and nikon have a long history of collaborating to bring high quality cutting edge consumer products to the market including wireless cameras and raw processing technologies the companies believe that this patent cross licensing agreement will substantially benefit customers of consumer products including digital cameras both parties will be able to innovate openly with each others technologies enabling new features and products to come to market
8547958 patents give effective protection if you have invented new technology that will lead to a product composition or process with significant long term commercial gain
8547959 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8547960 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8547961 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8547962 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8547963 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8547964 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8547965 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8547966 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8547967 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8547968 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8547969 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8547970 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8547971 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8547972 if the democrats dont get over this they will never look themselves in the mirror and say oh me oh my why isnt our party landsliding the worst republicans in the history of the nader is in denver this week for the
8547973 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8547974 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8547975 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8547976 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8547977 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8547978 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8547979 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8547980 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8547981 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8547982 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8547983 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8547984 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8547985 that should not take away from their great qualities as pioneers and doers
8547986 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
8547987 pickens is reaching that part of deep america thats usually not touched by the traditional environmental discourse

8548008 before a series of ufo reports in france in 1954 we rarely received reports of sightings from people driving along in cars it was from people flying in airplanes
8548009 if people see something they cant explain they try to fit it into existing patterns even something reported by others they dont have the mental discipline to look at something and not commit to what it is
8548010 the basic belief behind a car stop is that an electromagnetic em field dampens the cars electrical system and the engine effectively stops when reports began to come in about these encounters we find that people driving cars with diesel engines didnt report car stoppages while people with regular car engines did that supports the idea that something is happening because people just making up stories wouldnt originally make a distinction between diesel and non diesel engines
8548011 some em events occur in the presence of unknown metallic noisy disc shaped objects interesting but no slam dunk for aliens
8548012 regardless of what people are seeing that triggers ufo reports about 90 per cent of them involve nocturnal lights where else might you be when you can clearly see nocturnal lights certainly not in the city where theres too much ambient light youd likely be driving on a country road

8548045 the decision of our board to extend the trading is part of a coordinated strategy to level our exchange with its peers in the region and develop our local stock market to its full potential
8548046 they first look at the bigger markets in the morning but by the time they get the opportunity to look at our market the pse is already closing so why bother at all
8548047 the afternoon trading session is also aimed at preparing the pse to take full advantage of market friendly legislations that are now being put in place by the government like the personal equity retirement account pera law
8548048 the implementation of the extended trading hours will coincide with our timetable in commissioning our new trading system next year which is tentatively scheduled to go live on or before june 30 2009
8548049 times have changed we have to consider also that markets are much different now as trading has become more global
8548050 we will use the proceeds to partly fund our planned expansion for that year

8548053 the ministers see the agreement as paving the way to enhancing the regions economic integration and acting as an impetus to deepen and broaden the trade and investment among the 12 participating countries

8548055 we hope that this will lead toward a really greater east asia economic integration

8548077 for an athlete to be successful today in the world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this being a us based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8548078 thats why i dont think this is an overall bad thing
8548079 i think it can also really help the players become more comfortable in the environment they play

8548085 he is a player of real quality who is worth his weight in gold a key player for us i like to see him playing with confidence and freedom expressing himself like we know he can
8548086 this is also a fantastic time for david healy and hopefully he can go from strength to strength at sunderland im sure he has a new lease of life and i hope the move will turn out to be a very good one for him
8548087 i have no concerns at all about the number of young players in the squad
8548088 the young players we have like jonny evans ryan mcgivern michael oconnor sammy clingan dean shiels martin paterson kyle lafferty and peter thompson are all good players
8548089 we have a nice crop of young players backed up by experienced players and that shows the progress we are making together as a squad its important the young players get a feel for international football and they can all thrive in it

8548100 what sort of governing body allows junior cup fixtures to dictate over league games we are playing steel and sons cup one week cis cup the next then it will be the intermediate cup and we simply dont know when our
8548101 players naturally want to win cup games but my players are already asking when the next league fixture is coming we didnt want to enter the intermediate cup but you have to enter that if you want to play in the irish cup its very frustrating because we are now playing catch up and will have a load of games to get through that puts us under greater pressure to win promotion if i had my way we would only play in the league and irish cup
8548102 because of the amount of rain this month the water table is too high at stormont but if it is identified that the facilities are not good enough then it something we will have to address
8548103 the management of the venue is looked after by the venue itself and unless they come to us and say they are anticipating a problem because they have not received sufficient funding then there is not much we can do about that
8548104 we are very sorry for the spectators and disappointed there was no play we are disappointed at the small crowds and the lack of information for them and that is something we are going to have to look at
8548105 for the moment we have two international venues clontarf is the other and the marketing of matches and interest or lack of interest among spectators is something we are going to have to discuss at board level and work out our strategy
8548106 we are hopeful that there will be sufficient government funding to bring malahide on stream as another international venue in the next couple of years and bready are aware of the odi facilities required
8548107 they had the opportunity to host some of our matches this year but they felt their pitches werent quite ready but we are ready to assist as and when they ready to take up that opportunity
8548108 its not over yet we have not reached rock bottom we are in for more price rises in northern ireland very very soon
8548109 time capsule of the time when we started to feel it tight
8548110 i keep saying to people who will listen anybody who thinks that glentoran are just going to turn up and win games this season needs to be realistic it is just not going to happen
8548111 people are saying we are favourites but i have said we are not linfield are favourites they are the champions so they are favourites
8548112 anybody who thinks otherwise need to have a reality check look at the results cliftonville losing to distillery and linfield equalising late on against dungannon swifts its going to be a tough league a much higher standard than last year
8548113 this is a very good squad of players as i have said we are not firing on all cylinders but it will come lets just be realistic
8548114 we are conceding the same type of goals but it is different people who are responsible it just seems that we are having a little run at the moment for whatever reason and its certainly not for the want of working on it
8548115 celtic rugby is always striving to align itself with other professional rugby tournaments around the world consequently this season will be the last that the magners league is played in its present format
8548116 i am pleased to announce that from 2009 10 we will be introducing an end of season play off to determine the magners league champions with the top four teams qualifying for the knockout stage
8548117 also going forward we intend to address the irregular nature of the competition by creating a rhythmic season achieveable as magners league weekends will not compete with any other tournament
8548118 a grand final will provide a great day out for fans and commercial partners alike the emphasis will not just be about the participating finalists but a great celebration of celtic rugby on and off the pitch
8548119 fans have continued to show they appreciate the rugby that is on display in our competition as for the fourth successive season average attendances have again risen by 13 over the last year alone
8548120 magners league teams and players also enjoyed success in other competitions last season the rbs six nations champions heineken cup and anglo welsh cup winners are from amongst our ranks while the representation of capped players in magners league games is higher than other european leagues with the prospect of a british and irish lions tour at the end of the season this is the ideal time for those players to make their mark
8548121 football is a team game and i want all my outfield players to score goals
8548122 the defenders will come up for set pieces and i hope they can get on the end of a good cross and hurt the opposition
8548123 the midfielders are also capable of scoring and while we want davids phenomenal form to continue it is important that we do well as a team and i will be preaching the need for us to score goals from all over the park
8548124 hopefully the other lads can take the pressure off david and if they can do that our goals tally should look a lot better
8548125 when the little man is representing his country he is on fire and nine times out of 10 he will put the ball in the net but hell be happy if others score too lets be positive and go for goals
8548126 there isnt a rule which says we cannot play ryan in our world cup qualifying fixture
8548127 there is an acknowledgement that he would have to miss our next friendly game but it would be wrong of me to prolong any agony he must be feeling by leaving him out of this squad
8548128 he is a player who has come on the manchester city scene very quickly and his sending off was very harsh it was a disappointing cruel blow to him but as far as we are concerned he is available to play for us against slovakia if selected
8548129 if everyone is fit i know what my best starting eleven is
8548130 but we have to wait and see who is fit to play against slovakia
8548131 jonny evans has a hip injury and i know he will be trying his utmost to make the game
8548132 the big pluses for us was keeping our shape and taking a lot of confidence from the game we have learned a lot after three weeks of hard work and the plan has been to get the ball up the field quicker to david healy
8548133 its widely acknowledged that derry have the best supporters in the league they always get behind the team both at home and away and its great to join a club with that kind of support
8548134 i came up last week for a few days training and thank god everything went well and the manager sat down and told me hed like to have me here
8548135 derry are one of the best clubs in the league without a doubt and im looking forward to getting started
8548136 id be hoping to break into the team as soon as possible trainings been going well in the last week or two they have a great team and a great squad here all i can do is keep my head down and work hard and give the manager one or two headaches when hes picking the team
8548137 i was aware of billy because he was in the republic of ireland under 18s and when i was at dunfermline i needed a left sided player at the time
8548138 i spoke to roy keane about him and roy liked him but thought he might struggle at that level so i brought in adam hamill from liverpool and i just followed billys progress from then on
8548139 we cant sign anyone at the moment because were out of the window but hes an out of contract player so were able to sign him
8548140 i think they are in a very difficult situation its really a very tough tough spot where they are living because of the noise
8548141 their houses were some of the first wave of redevelopment in the mersey street area and the volume of air traffic has increased enormously since they were built
8548142 these are some of the most disadvantaged residents in east belfast and yet bca has shown no concern for their plight
8548143 on its website the civil aviation authority says the 57db leq contour corresponds to the onset of significant community annoyance based on large scale studies in the uk
8548144 we as an airport are governed by national standards and we comply with them quite willingly to me its a bit of a non issue if local residents would like us to behave differently
8548145 if people ask the airport to do things over and above what the legislation requires it makes it difficult to know where to draw the line
8548146 the report should be with us any time soon and it will cover life expectancy energy efficiency and acoustic issues with single glazing and replacement costs
8548147 we will consider the results of the survey and report back to the board we cant do anything until we have that report in but it is a cost issue
8548148 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
8548149 it might be that all it takes is a few good men to do nothing for evil to flourish but it only takes one or two good men to take things too far for injustice to flourish

8548161 kids dont grow up in the back yard dreaming of being a long snapper the biggest thing lately is the shift from when i was a rookie a long time ago it was always the guys who did something else who could long snap then it became specialized and they changed the rules in college so those guys couldnt get hit all of a sudden the college snappers are 210 220 pounds and those guys cant hold up in the nfl
8548162 its great to have him here hes a guy whos done it for a long time and knows what hes doing
8548163 the big thing is consistency and trust i can think about me and what i need to do instead of worrying where the snap is going to be
8548164 if i was a college lineman id practice that all the time
8548165 if you can become a good snapper you have a good job for a long time

8548201 we all need to be prepared and ready to respond from the citizen level and at every level of government
8548202 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8548203 if residents make individual and family preparations they make it easier for first responders to focus on people who can t help themselves and need help first
8548204 once the hurricane warning flags are flying its too late to be thinking of a hurricane plan

8548215 americas claim to be a beacon of freedom in a dark world has been dimmed by guantanamo abu ghraib and the flouting of the geneva conventions amid the panicky unipolar posturing in the aftermath of september 11
8548216 war against extremism was fought on behalf of fundamental values such as respect for human rights and the rule of law the u s decision to deny its detainees the protections afforded them by international law undermines both of these bedrock principles
8548217 ironically it is americas enduring respect for personal freedom that makes it a world leader and the envy of terrorist brigands american laws work remarkably well despite their flaws and millions have left their homelands to enjoy the fruits of an open society it is easy in these leaden days to suggest that federal rules must be overhauled to ensure that the guilty are rooted out and punished too easy the bylaws of the do not exist in splendid isolation they are models worthy of imitation

8548228 it is disgraceful that border patrol agents are put in harms way and our government doesnt do everything reasonably within its power to protect us from marauding mexican soldiers and others
8548229 without a forceful response to these illegal incursions an agent will eventually be seriously wounded or killed it is only a matter of time
8548230 the incursions will not stop until the mexican military units and their commanders are held accountable for their actions
8548231 it is a documented fact that the mexican military is corrupt and is involved in protecting drug cartels smugglers and other criminals
8548232 there is an international boundary for a reason and they are to be respected by both governments

8548237 its harder to hide the truth in a video than it is in words

8548244 solo una collaborazione pi costante tra i discografici e la tv pu portare i talent show a diventare importanti collettori di attenzione su personaggi nuovi e fare in modo che nascano talenti veri questi fenomeni sono reali la tv crea attenzione e con questi programmi abbiamo assistito a un ritorno degli interpreti
8548245 attraverso i talent show si creano i presupposti perch si notino voci nuove marco carta che ha una sua particolarit vocale ha avuto la possibilit ad amici di mettersi in evidenza anche come personaggio in grado di bucare il video e noto che con la tv ci si sempre fatto i conti e la musica ne ha bisogno per vendere adesso la televisione si messa a usare la musica a livello di scouting
8548246 se i discografici fossero partner ideali e costanti di queste trasmissioni probabilmente i talent show avrebbero una chance in pi per trovare un talento sette edizioni di amici programma con il quale warner mantiene una costante collaborazione sono tante per tirare fuori un artista

8548258 while i do not have any information specifically about pbs in your area we do value programming like this and realize pbs in hd is important to our customers unfortunately due to limits in bandwidth we are not able to offer all of the local channels we provide to the salt lake area in hd i have entered a request for pbs hd to be offered in your area our programming department take channel requests like yours into account when deciding on new programming to offer
8548259 as mentioned in our previous e mail we are launching new satellites to increase the number of hd channels that we are able to offer it is possible that pbs hd may become available at that time however i wouldnt want to speculate on any dates for this or our service provided by other companies
8548260 thank you for your e mail at this time we do not have specific information when the pbs stations will be launched in hd we are currently working on offering more hd channels in the future please log on to our website for more information about new programming and services being added to dish network

8548287 s kan vi konomer igen sidde og hive os i sk gget og brygge forklaringer op omkring hvordan det kan v re at det danske arbejdsmarked forts tter med at udvikle sig s bomst rkt som tilf ldet er det til trods for at den konomiske v kst er bremset markant op faktum er i hvert fald at ledigheden igen i juli fortsatte den uafbrudte faldende trend som vi har set i nu tre r
8548288 skal man finde p noget bare marginalt negativt at knytte til tallene s er det at hastigheden hvormed ledigheden falder er aftaget igennem 2008 ligeledes kan der v re et par sm teknsike problemer i forbindelse med opg relsen af feriedagpenge men det ndrer alts ikke ved at vi endnu engang st r tilbage overraskede over arbejdsmarkedets styrke
8548289 det er meget gl deligt at ledigheden bliver ved med at udvikle sig s st rkt selvom den konomiske situation begynder at v re mere blandet ledigheden virker s ledes stabiliserende i relation til eksempelvis boligmarkedet den lave ledighed g r at der endnu er langt til at dansk konomi bliver grebet af en negativ spiral selvom v ksten er lav ledigheden forn gter dermed forel bigt de mere dystre udsigter for dansk konomi
8548290 stigende ledighed er dog ikke n dvendigvis en d rlig nyhed for dansk konomi i den nuv rende konomiske situation der er ingen tvivl om at presset p arbejdsmarkedet fortsat er meget h jt og ledigheden er markant under det strukturelle niveau alts et niveau der er foreneligt med en stabil l n og prisinflation p lidt l ngere sigt
8548291 det har v ret en stor overraskelse at arbejdsl sheden er blevet ved med at falde gennem en lang periode og n et ned p s lave niveauer som ingen havde troet muligt p trods af at dansk konomi i over et r har vist klare tegn p opbremsning disse tegn er blevet tydeligere gennem de seneste m neder og alt peger nu i retning af at bunden for ledigheden er meget t t p i l bet af andet halv r vil man med stor sandsynlighed se arbejdsl sheden stige og den tendens vil forts tte gennem 2009
8548292 det er ganske enkelt imponerende hvor langt ledigheden efterh nden er kommet ned og hvor stor en del af arbejdsstyrken der er i arbejde det er ingen tvivl om at arbejdsmarkedet st r over for k mpe udfordringer rent strukturelt i forhold til at skaffe flere h nder men ikke desto mindre er der grund til at gl de sig over hvor st rkt arbejdsmarkedet har klaret sig rent konjunkturm ssigt

8548300 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
8548301 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the middle eastern gaming policy sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
8548302 after starting an internet middle eastern gaming policy sales division in 2003 we saw our sales increase three fold
8548303 and this resulted in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in our company our number of employees has doubled and our number of it staff has quadrupled in a years time
8548304 we rely on affiliate marketing to drive our middle eastern gaming policy sales and lead acquisition mostly because some webmasters in our field are better at marketing online than we are
8548305 because people hardly come to our stores in person anymore
8548306 and where there was once one or two big internet marketing firms now there are well over ten in our industry this growth speaks to the power of the information super high way
8548307 i prefer to take my time and read about it all online first
8548308 im not a high pressure sales type and rather just go to the store and check out sas soon as possible
8548309 when we added a website and shopping cart system our numbers went through the roof
8548310 this teamed with high positioning in the major search engines really created a whole new market for us that was never expected
8548311 i was working 9 to 5 at a marketing firm doing the typical corporate thing now however i have my own website production center and payment processing this allows me to work from home under my own rules and with unlimited income potential

8548313 this change had less to do with the rate of technology development and more to do with actual versus anticipated rates of adoption our platform as a service bungee connect has achieved the level of robustness and capability we envisioned and we are committed to its continued regular advancement and support as with most new breakthrough offerings bungee connect will require longer incubation time to become broadly accepted as a start up our action yesterday extends our operating plan well into 2010 to more deeply establish bungee connect in the marketplace

8548365 you have to pick it up or you are going to be left behind
8548366 he knows what he wants hes really pushing us especially the underclassmen to step up our game to look beyond just being a freshman
8548367 hes had a heck of a 10 days with the team
8548368 he brings an unusual quality of power and strength he should be a good husky for a long time hes bright and understand i dont see anything that could hold him back from being a very good player
8548369 i had my auntie and uncle calling me telling me i was starting
8548370 im learning a lot especially from the upperclassmen especially the techniques
8548371 its intense but were having fun and learning a lot too
8548372 we do a lot of extra things i think the defensive line is the hardest working group on the team right now
8548373 ive been very pleased with their physical approach to it
8548374 knowing how to be a team member is very important but if you have defensive linemen that cant play physical youve got a problem

8548386 the upshot is that after growth of about 1 2 per cent this year we now expect the uk economy to contract by about 0 2 per cent in 2009 we previously forecast growth of 0 5 per cent
8548387 this projection is well below the latest consensus forecast of 0 9 per cent
8548388 but these developments wont prevent the economy from slowing further over the next year or so
8548389 it is quite plausible that they fall even further than this

8548397 people were also concerned about what would happen to the community sschool and its assets
8548398 ive had a lot of criticism for not stopping it the dealing in the museum a lot of people have said im too soft because i dont like seeing young boys locked up in jail
8548399 since the mardigrass we have really worked our butts off and in the hemp bar i know for a fact there has been no dealing in there and still theyve done this which is very disappointing what happened to community policing
8548400 it would be a tragedy if the museum didnt survive as a cultural icon and centre
8548401 if you are going to lose a property and its going to save lives it doesnt matter
8548402 but its not going to improve the safety on the bangalow to lismore road most of the accidents happen between springvale and binna burra

8548405 ik zou een laatste fiscale hervorming willen voorstellen voor het einde van de legislatuur
8548406 maar er kunnen geen maatregelen genomen worden zonder voldoende middelen de hervorming zal passen in de begroting 2009

8548408 en un momento llegu a sentir mucho dolor por eso me puse un vendaje apretado espero que en estos dos d as de descanso se me mejore
8548409 para ser mi primer partido en nueva york creo que fue lindo hubo cosas que no me salieron bien hoy pero me voy contento
8548410 es mi primera victoria despu s de la operaci n y la valoro mucho la considero muy importante por la confianza que me da para este torneo
8548411 me sent un poco cansada en el segundo set y estaba respirando por la boca por suerte tom un segundo aire y pude cerrar el partido
8548412 a lot of people are counting us out its our job to prove those people wrong obviously we have dug ourselves a hole
8548413 when they put an x next to your name in the standings you run out of days
8548414 its not where we want to be but no hole is too deep to climb out of
8548415 i cant describe in words how disappointing it is i couldnt get out of the fifth inning
8548416 i didnt give us a chance to win the ballgame tonight
8548417 they have way too much talent over there to write off im sure a lot of people want to do that but thats probably what they want you count them out so they can sneak up on you
8548418 i wouldnt count them out until they are if they are mathematically eliminated
8548419 theyve been around too long they have too many good players to write off
8548420 hell give us the best chance right now to close the game out
8548421 it shows that we have a lot of character and a lot of guys with short term memories
8548422 we were able to put tuesday night behind us and come back and play thats important
8548423 the rascals that have been hanging around here for a whole year we have to face that every time we lose a game like tuesday night its a reminder of that
8548424 i felt very confident in him because hes a good young hitter
8548425 i never thought about pinch hitting for him or anything like that because i felt he is a big part of what were doing and would come through
8548426 we are trying to figure out what the strengths are
8548427 everybody here has to have that month where they are as good as is
8548428 i havent made any decisions yet on what direction im going to go as far as playing time
8548429 we will just wait until we get to the game and i will determine how long i want everybody to go
8548430 im not leaning any way right now but a few more reps arent going to hurt
8548431 weve had our couple of injuries here too those things happen and thats all part of the game
8548432 i feel like im ready to go against the rams
8548433 i wouldnt mind sitting out this game who wouldnt but also i wouldnt mind playing
8548434 the majority of the reps will go to the younger guys the guys who are trying to make this football team as backup players
8548435 i need to see him be better than he was last week im not going to say he was poor last week but i want to see improvement
8548436 people are fighting for jobs well just have to see what happens and how many linemen were gong to keep
8548437 demons of the past those rascals that have been hanging around us for a whole year we have to face them
8548438 we have to know what happened every time we lose a game like last night we are reminded of that so we have to come back then next night confront it and move on
8548439 when he hits we simply win because he just carries us
8548440 if my bat was slow it was a different story but i knew the speed and strength was there
8548441 i knew what i was doing wrong it was pretty bad for a while we were working to get timing and the hitting position it took me longer than i wanted to get consistent at it there were games i felt good games i felt like junk
8548442 as a hitter you want to get to the point where you dont think about hits or about that you are doing wrong but about what you want to do you start to see the ball better and things start working out
8548443 i have 14 years in if they havent seen it by now they are not going to see it im playing to help the team not to showcase i would like to come back but this is something we will visit after the season

8548447 our hottest and most requested poetry kit in our line
8548448 its not the time that you want it to happen but joses been very very good for us hes had a very good year but he had trouble executing his pitches they made him pay
8548449 obviously the game got away from us in the eighth inning until that point it was close and we had a chance
8548450 we should win that game it was bad its the first time its happened to me
8548451 i know they tried hard to catch it i didnt make the pitches i had to make to get that guy out i rushed a little bit i dont know why i was good in the bullpen
8548452 he just got a hold of it i wish it wouldve been on the corner instead of where it was
8548453 hes done it before for us im very confident that hes going to bounce back
8548454 i cant even describe in words how disappointing it is
8548455 i didnt do my job i wanted to go deep in the game and i couldnt even get out of the fifth inning i didnt give us a chance to win
8548456 they tie the game up and to go out and give up two runs is not good
8548457 you wonder where we would be without moose this year
8548458 hes been so consistent this year he has 16 wins and there have been games hes pitched where he deserved to win as well hes been a definite constant in our rotation and its great to have him out there today
8548459 hes been very productive in the no 6 hole hes had a lot of big hits for us
8548460 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8548461 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8548462 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8548463 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8548464 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8548465 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
8548466 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
8548467 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
8548468 i dont doubt that one bit that alex is going to be fine hes going to come through for us
8548469 if youve gone any time with the yankees youve probably been booed they booed derek jeter its part of the game and alex has been through it
8548470 hes hit in the clutch for his whole career and you expect him to do it again
8548471 theres going to be a lot going on this offseason
8548472 when he has a night like that hes going to hear it from the crowd
8548473 thats the way it works but id rather have him than not have him hes still young enough hes gonna have a lot of good years ahead of him
8548474 they gotta start hitting injuries or no injuries they gotta be more consistent
8548475 hed love to be able to get tons of work and have all the otas and all that stuff
8548476 its just not where we are right now the most important thing to me is us getting ready as a group and getting ready for miami
8548477 i really look at the last preseason game as being able to evaluate individuals as opposed to the team and its really important from that perspective
8548478 im seeing more and more out of kellen with his patience in the pocket the ability to assess the defense knowing what to get to offensively the poise and ive liked that
8548479 obviously its the last preseason game and you want to go out and have a good showing
8548480 you want to leave a taste not only in the fans mouth but your teammates and coaches as well
8548481 there are examples where health inequalities have narrowed but in too many cases we have seen a widening
8548482 but that means the magnitude of inequalities is flexible if the gap can widen it can get narrower
8548483 in the uk we have seen an improvement in peoples health over the last eight years
8548484 the key message of our report is that the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age are the fundamental drivers of health and health inequity
8548485 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8548486 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8548487 people need the opportunity the possibility to take control of their lives but the conditions need to be right to allow them to do that

8548489 we thought that the bullpen was our strength with joba farnsy kyle farnsworth and latroy hawkins
8548490 now were trying to figure out what are strengths are
8548491 im a big believer that you can save a lot runs and that you dont have to drive them in
8548492 a catcher can save a lot of runs the way he works with his pitchers
8548493 its weird hearing that from another player because normally were programmed as players that last year is behind us put it behind you
8548494 its awkward because were all competitors and youre not used to complimenting an opponent especially right before a game i could get used to it though
8548495 two years ago they didnt even show up i dont even know if they were in the state
8548496 its going to be funny for me im going to laugh
8548497 we won i can laugh i got the last laugh
8548498 nothing im worried about the redskins im not worried about the patriots if we have to see those guys again in february trust me the mood will be a lot different

8548510 hes due and you expect him to do it again
8548511 if youve had any time with the yankees youve probably been booed its because the fans have such a passion to win and thats what you want
8548512 things would be different if torre were still running things
8548513 joe has been my eighth manager and id put him at the top of the list he knows what hes doing the games not too fast for him or anything the only thing he cant do is play for us at times
8548514 im aware of what im doing im pretty even keeled all of the time thats just my personality im not a guy thats going to jump up and down im not a guy who hangs my head if we dont get a hit in a situation or if we dont make a pitch its never been my personality im just kind of relaxed
8548515 that might be the look that i portray i am intense theres no doubt about it i am intense about the game and im thinking about every pitch everything that could possibly happen i was the same way as a player
8548516 even without having our two best pitchers so forth and so on they still stunk thats the bottom line
8548517 all i can think about is this game at this point well see what happens tomorrow
8548518 theres going to be a lot going on this offseason i promise you that
8548519 hes going to fine in the playoffs if we make it
8548520 i believe in this team and i believe in the guys on the field and i believe we can get this done
8548521 we couldnt have been any worse the first two games
8548522 its tough for everyone ive had some struggles my last few outings i just cant seem to get that clean outing
8548523 theres going to be a lot going on this offseason i promise you that
8548524 each day that ticks off games have more importance thats the bottom line when youre chasing people
8548525 the sodomy issue is more relevant at the national level but not in permatang pauh
8548526 there was one game last year when we had 11 freshmen starting and im not counting red shirt freshmen
8548527 that is not an excuse thats just reality the thought methodology was lets get the best guys on the field regardless of their age and get them experience
8548528 we knew that there was potential for this not to be pretty in 2007 now did i expect us to go 3 9 absolutely not but you knew when you were going to play a whole bunch of these young guys that you just brought in that there were going to be some growing pains
8548529 i take the full responsibility for the difference between 3 9 and whatever better it could have been but i grew up under bill parcells philosophy that you pay in advance and thats basically what we were doing we were paying in advance and were hoping to cash in and the cash in time is this year and next year as we go forward
8548530 we are taking lismore among other local government areas to sporting associations within nsw and to national associations to see what events can transpire
8548531 but until such time as the event is actually ready for a formal announcement in a formal process with the right parties involved in it then it is not wise to drip feed too much information into the marketplace
8548532 thats why i am not prepared to elaborate too much other than to say oztag cricket and baseball
8548533 in terms of infrastructure in terms of sporting associations in terms of virtually all the criteria they lismore stack up well
8548534 in this region baseball stacks up rugby league rugby union stack up well and cricket stacks up well and as a consequence of that the facilities are here for that
8548535 and there are some local natural attributes that dont necessarily get picked up in a council asset register and we are referring to triathlon there
8548536 weve had the sports audit for two or three weeks now and we are using the information contained within it to work with complete sports marketing to target some of the sports rick has mentioned
8548537 we have manufactured some of our own events and we have bid for some ourselves but we can handle more and we want more and we are looking to complete sports marketing to help identify more sporting events bid for them and win them
8548538 but i suggest that our first one wouldnt be 30 000
8548539 it might be 5000 something that we could handle within existing budgets
8548540 unfortunately i couldnt get us out of there and give us a chance to win just a bad outing
8548541 i tried to be too good to keep the game close so my team could make a comeback and win the game
8548542 nothing to say it was a bad night for me
8548543 i didnt make the pitches i had to make to get that guy out i missed that spot with him
8548544 maybe jerry should get a second career as a doctor
8548545 he just carries us he puts us on his back
8548546 it shows we have a lot of character in this room a lot of guys with short term memories
8548547 but thats out of my hands im past the audition stage if they dont see it by now what can i do
8548548 were just fortunate that we needed a starting pitcher and byrd had cleared waivers early in the process
8548549 and were fortunate that a player of mark kotsays caliber cleared waivers early in the process other players got blocked but these two happened to slide through
8548550 ill warm up during batting practice and ill try to imitate him he just starts laughing
8548551 its a funky delivery but he gets them out ive never seen that before but it works for him he sees it as a way to stay in tempo
8548552 going to that old school windup was something he did to get an edge on hitters and avoid tipping pitches
8548553 he can even make stuff up as he goes along in the course of a game if he needs to too i admire that hes done a nice job so far keeping us in games and stabilizing our rotation when we needed it
8548554 i cant even describe it in words how disappointing it is
8548555 i didnt do my job i wanted to go deep in the game i couldnt even get out of the fifth inning
8548556 when we tied the game up to go back out and give up two runs thats not good
8548557 weve got to face that as well and to come back after tuesday nights loss its huge for us
8548558 the rascals that have been hanging around us for a whole year we have to face that every time we lose a game like tuesday night were reminded of that so weve got to face it confront it deal with it and move on
8548559 thats how its going to be for the rest of the year a battle every day every series is going to be huge every game is going to be huge
8548560 its definitely a different frame of mind this year were not thinking about september 07 were thinking about winning right now
8548561 if it was all up to me the business would go under because i could not do my job if i had to all the paperwork too
8548562 it just means you have to stay on top of the changes otherwise dealing with the red tape to correct the mistake is the hardest part
8548563 there is a lot to do but once you know what you are doing its not too bad

8548572 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions

8548577 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8548578 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8548579 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8548580 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8548581 this is one experimental case that is indicative but there are many others
8548582 there is the possibility of creating designer drugs with this newly discovered information
8548583 these are models that conform to the point of view that the structures have been designed to exert very strong control of their motions
8548584 those motions correspond closely to the motions needed for their function
8548585 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50 there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8548586 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal
8548587 one of the most dangerous weapons in the world today is the price of oil we ship nearly 700 million a day to unstable or hostile nations for their oil it pays for terrorist bombs going off from baghdad to beirut

8548589 i had gone to so many speed dating events where i had nothing in common with the guys i was meeting
8548590 i thought the concept of speed dating was great in the sense that it increased the odds that you would hit it off with someone however i still wasnt meeting the guys i wanted to meet and thats when it hit me speed dating had the quantity aspect covered if we could just find a way to incorporate the quality portion by increasing the chance for connection we could offer something the other sites werent
8548591 speed dating for women 59 and taller and men 62 and taller
8548592 a lot of women are into and requesting these types of events were like burger king in the sense that we want you to have it your way

8548595 an important role of cyanobacteria in extreme environments may be to hold the soil in place
8548596 the tanks were in a huge warehouse that is not suited for gas storage it was filled with wooden platforms and had no fire extinguishing system in place it posed a very grave threat to local residents
8548597 our study has shown that bmp signalling molecules released by cells bind to the type iv collagen extracellular matrix
8548598 we have also shown that human type iv collagen binds a human bmp signalling molecule suggesting that the regulation also exists in vertebrates
8548599 as alterations in the activity of bmp and type iv collagen molecules can lead to cancer and kidney diseases respectively our data will ultimately have important implications for human disease
8548600 the bmp signalling pathway initially acts as a tumour suppressor but when a tumour becomes malignant it uses the pathway to become aggressive and spread to other parts of the body
8548601 in addition part of the collagen we have identified as important has tumour suppressor activity so we believe that when the bmp pathway is being exploited by aggressive tumours the collagens are counteracting this this is another facet to be investigated
8548602 finally type iv collagen is also important in kidney development and disease

8548627 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8548628 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8548629 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8548630 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8548631 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator

8548633 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8548634 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much

8548641 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8548642 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8548643 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8548644 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8548645 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
8548646 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
8548647 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
8548648 they told us it was the first time they had to give a platinum award a double one for that matter for a dvd according to the company dvds rarely sell much to warrant an award it is really an honour that we broke this myth this shows that we are giving our audience what it wants
8548649 we made it because of all these people they supported us and bought our music despite the pirates who continue to plunder our works our fans continue to be supportive choosing to buy originals instead of the fakes

8548652 it came as a vision and then before thinking of the lyrics i already thought of shooting a video potraying an ugly man who scares children where ever he goes i then decided to write down a song and it has come out nicely i think i will shoot a video before releasing the album itself
8548653 i am really shy i can joke with people close to me and those i feel comfortable with but facing big crowds would not be my thing i cannot do it i have to be honest
8548654 i make music because i have a story to tell it is like when you have a poem and you do not share it with other people you will always have this burning desire that you want to pour out and you do not need money to express your inner feeling if my music sells that is a bonus for me but if it does not bring me much money there in no problem there either i have a descent job at botswana technology centre and i do not depend on music for a living

8548665 consolidation in the german leisure carry market isinevitable and tui travel has said that until the situation isresolved this will be a hurdle to improving operationalperformance
8548666 it appears the boom was employed prior to being authorized
8548667 early indications are the workers got started early clearly there was a miscommunication in timing
8548668 we feel pretty upset about the injuries and its the driver were particularly concerned about
8548669 it shook quite hard and i came off my seat and everybody was screaming we went sideways a little and then werent moving
8548670 the c train driver was really bleeding a lot i got the driver out and pulled the glass off him

8548672 these individuals belong to a cell in one of the most violent gangs in this city

8548680 although she remains firmly at the head of the countrys ruling party a rising star known by the single name mayawati is challenging gandhis position as the countrys most powerful woman
8548681 in the running to be prime minister from her perch as chief minister of uttar pradesh indias most populous state
8548682 in 1995 at 39 she was the youngest politician elected to the post and was also the first dalit to head a state government
8548683 in 2007 she shrewdly built an alliance with brahmins and the bahujan samaj party which she heads has started to increase its national presence some say she could trail blaze again as indias first dalit prime minister
8548684 she tried to get up the steps but she couldnt because he had her in his mouth
8548685 i was screaming i never slept that night i was a nervous wreck
8548686 we are very careful not to jump to conclusions just because a larger dog attacks a smaller dog
8548687 she was going into a store at 118 avenue and 47 street
8548688 we just chatted for a few minutes she seemed less scruffy than when we partied together
8548689 it bothers me to think that she was there so close to strathcona county where her body was found
8548690 if we were partying and there were two guys there with us shed be hiding in the bathtub
8548691 we knew a lot of shady people theyd jack people and do home invasions just to get money for more crack
8548692 ive been thinking a lot about her lately wondering whats happening with the case but i havent heard or seen anything in the media
8548693 every time that a body is found thats a lot of manpower and energy that goes into that and then it takes away from the other workings of the municipality
8548694 its very costly and i hate putting a price on this because people are found dead and thats a terrible thing but it certainly stresses our resources here from an rcmp perspective
8548695 life is tough in the first division and we cant afford to go back there again so it is very important that we win our first game so as to boost our confidence
8548696 our coach gordon igesund has been here before and his experience in the psl has rubbed off on the players we have set ourselves realistic goals and aim to finish in the top 10 the three points from ajax cape town will lay a good foundation for us to achieve success this season
8548697 i have two years remaining on my arrows contract i hope i dont encounter any snags because i really want to move on with my football
8548698 everything has been going right here at supersport since i arrived here last week i think im doing well at training though the coach has not said anything to me i am just hopeful that things go my way
8548699 people have to remember to always be aware of your personal surroundings and personal safety should always be a priority
8548700 it is an area that a lot of people travel in but it is also an area that affords a lot of seclusion in some areas and thats when you really have to be concerned is when youre in those secluded areas those would be areas that would be targeted
8548701 one of the best things you can do for a number of reasons is go running or jogging with a group of friends
8548702 we are grateful for the contribution made by vodacom to bloemfontein celtic over the past three years and now they have come back to us again to make another commitment of being our main sponsors for another three years
8548703 the kind sponsorship deal that has been made by vodacom this time will take bloemfontein celtic to a higher level both on and off the field
8548704 in continuing our partnership as title sponsor of bloemfontein celtic vodacom is re affirming its belief and commitment to soccer in our country
8548705 as the greatest supporter of south african soccer we are proud of our association with a club of the calibre of bloemfontein celtic football club and we look forward to joining the clubs supporters in sharing many moments of spectacular soccer and glory in the years ahead
8548706 the fact is anglogold ashanti is holding discussions on the future direction of the club and will in due course make a definite announcement on the matter
8548707 we can state categorically that the club will not be relocated from its base in obuasi neither will its name be changed anglogold ashanti believes that ultimately the club should not be an attachment of its mining operations but should be a professionally managed independent football club with a commitment to excellence
8548708 im disappointed at being dropped because i dont know what the real reason behind it is
8548709 i know that i have scored only one goal in the first four qualifiers but there are other strikers as well who havent scored in many matches
8548710 i feel good about my form and when the league starts this coming weekend i will be looking sharp
8548711 we are doing well in the toto cup and now we have three more group stages matches before the knockout round
8548712 the defenders were always nervous whenever bengo had the ball that is how we came to concede a useless penalty
8548713 this is not the first time we have had a worm or a virus
8548714 its not a frequent occurrence but this isnt the first time
8548715 it was never a threat to any command and control or operations computer
8548716 well do our best to track down how it got there and close that gateway

8548718 because of excessive revisions and inputs from a wide number of people the draft policy now sounds more like a law than a policy
8548719 and this was exactly the observation of the law ministry about the policy when the energy ministry sent the draft to the law ministry a few months back
8548720 that is why the law ministry observed that instead of such a policy the government should work on several laws instead of just one
8548721 once the government acquires a piece of land it cant be returned to the original owner the government can however restore the land and allow its agricultural use
8548722 there has been no study by any group about such an open pit mine in barapukuria how can this committee suggest this besides who would invest for a test case if there is no guarantee of any profit
8548723 again technically you also need bigger land for an open pit mine the barapukuria mine area has a power plant and other structures then is this a feasible idea or just an undue idea
8548724 absence of frc is an indicator that the water might be contaminated with pathogens there is an increase in the cases of waterborne diseases during the last few months
8548725 the belief that we can go further and eliminate coal from our energy supply is a dangerous delusion
8548726 its a good thing for insurance companies because it reduces their risk but the main benefit is for consumers and the environment
8548727 this is something many consumers will benefit from for example people in the bay area where you have transit choices can take public transit once in a while instead of driving why not create an incentive
8548728 its wildly popular and drivers are saving a lot of money
8548729 ook start de vara in januari met een progressieve debat website onder redactie van francisco van jole het is jammer dat op internet het politieke en maatschappelijke debat gemonopoliseerd wordt door rechtsige sites als geenstijl wij willen daar graag een aanvulling op bieden waar onfatsoenlijke bijdragen streng gemodereerd worden
8548730 as of 2000 the united states was producing in excess of 11 billion liters of waste vegetable oil annually
8548731 in todays media environment it is vital that businesses communicate online and companies that choose to ignore this are running a major risk traditional pr tactics are not going to go away anytime soon but it is essential for companies to integrate online pr and social media into their existing offline communications strategies
8548732 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focused on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications

8548734 while customers are already familiar with ninjaprobes wire speed traffic capture capabilities our addition of synchronized traffic replay even across multiple probes adds a new dimension to network monitoring and trouble shooting
8548735 after precisely time stamping every captured packet ninjaprobe can now accurately replay stored data while maintaining inter packet delay intervals guaranteeing recreation of the originally monitored traffic
8548736 high volume data storage coupled to accurate data replay is the equivalent of network cctv giving operators the reassurance that they can readily share a previous user experience and quickly isolate issues that might be impacting network performance
8548737 pixstas adimage network allows devidoll to attract the attention of global customers from an early stage its proved to be a low risk low cost way to increase brand awareness internationally

8548739 in the first half of 2008 the home entertainment industry saw a substantial increase in high definition software sales deg europe estimates that despite the economic slow down software sales increased six fold in units and five fold in value across europe further driving growth expectations for next generation disk sales
8548740 despite tough economic times the figures clearly demonstrate a strong desire amongst consumers to adopt new technologies and deg europe is hopeful that consumers continue to embrace next generation technologies as they continue to evolve
8548741 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
8548742 despite the predicted downturn we are still suffering a skills crisis so it is essential that we dont disillusion our skilled workers at a time when we need them most
8548743 life is an echo it gives back what you have given
8548744 last year was obviously very disappointing with the champions league
8548745 thats a trophy i obviously want very badly and hopefully with the squad weve got here weve got a great chance of doing that
8548746 this demonstrates the depth of work that chelsea is doing in the community
8548747 four years ago we had a good look at giving more back and as a football club were all doing that collectively

8548754 organisations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
8548755 while computers may drive efficiency the data centres that run businesses are often far from efficient they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery

8548781 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients and in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8548782 we will be using a single provider which will help to streamline the co ordination between the dhb the provider and the families and we are also aiming to station a dhb person in australia to help co ordinate things on the ground for those families
8548783 the first half of 2008 has confirmed the long term trend by utilities to invest in projects to modernise and upgrade power transmission infrastructure
8548784 prysmian was able to meet this demand globally and can now rely on a solid order book ensuring high visibility on future sales growth the order book for submarine cables covers production capacity until the first half of 2010 while orders for high voltage underground cables already cover more than 50 of production capacity in 2009 recently we have also taken a strategic step forward signing an agreement with the oil company petrobras allowing us to expand our scope of operations into high tech high margin businesses and entering with a full range of products into the industry of services for the off shore oil drilling industry

8548825 over the weekend the papers have been filled with false stories on the girls but instead of the tired old split stories they have invented rumors of a brand new girls aloud reality show
8548826 these reports could not be more wrong and the girls are too busy putting the finishing touches to their brand new album to be filming a new show let alone bringing on a board new member
8548827 the papers often get things wrong but this one should win some kind of award
8548828 the girls have never forgotten that reality tv gave them their break now they want to give someone else the chance to enjoy a taste of the success they have enjoyed
8548829 the winner will get to perform with the group on stage during a one off concert but the girls hope theyll be able to discover a hidden talent who could join the band as a fully paid up member
8548830 the girls have a huge amount of commitments outside the band it makes sense to look for someone who can stand in if one of them cant make a show

8548835 the anger of the staff at the way the company has treated them
8548836 this was a motion that arose spontaneously from the floor of the meeting because people are angry at the way the company has treated them both in terms of enterprise agreement negotiations and also the redundancy announcements
8548837 age staff are passionate about their masthead and their readers and are disappointed that the managers of the company appear willing to sacrifice quality journalism for the sake of the bottom line
8548838 people just feel frustrated at the lack of any real strategy from the company

8548846 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8548847 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8548848 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8548849 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8548850 you must remain here and continue fighting if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated
8548851 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8548852 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8548853 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8548854 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8548855 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8548856 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8548857 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8548872 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and for canada as a whole
8548873 the development and marketing of this expertise requires a strategic plan to enable quebec to become a leader in water management
8548874 at a time when water is becoming scarce in many parts of the world its economic development stirs up substantial opposition however though some people fear harmful exploitation or even the drying up of our water resources it is urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8548875 were concerned about that we know theres pressure from the u s to export canadas water but we see water as a human right and a public resource
8548876 we dont want to see water commodified and commercialized in this manner
8548877 they see it as an economic opportunity and clearly the motivation here is profit
8548878 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted

8548896 were probably a day or two away from being very confident about where it will land
8548897 when night falls and there is no electricity it smells worse
8548898 we cant sleep not only because of the smell but because of the mosquitoes
8548899 what ends up in the sea is the water normally reclaimed for agricultural purposes upon proper treatment
8548900 gazas power woes have exacerbated the situation after israel destroyed the main electricity station in 2006 when we are able to generate electricity it is pumping sewage away from homes that takes priority this leaves little for treatment
8548901 ninety per cent of gazas drinking water is considered polluted under the international standards specified by the world health organisation
8548902 in the daytime we are farmers at night we are taliban
8548903 the taliban and the americans are as different as fire and water maybe the water will kill the fire or the fire will kill the water but one of these things has to happen
8548904 we have very advanced rockets you can split them into three parts and carry them on donkeys then you just walk along and when you see a convoy of troops you can fix them together and fire them very quickly
8548905 if the foreigners did not have their planes then within five days i guarantee we would be in the avenues of kabul
8548906 the areas controlled by the taliban are very secure and in most of them they dont bother anyone its ok if people shave and listen to music and in the markets you can even buy tvs in some parts you are not allowed to watch tv but they still let you shave and listen to music
8548907 if the taliban get hold of them they will be finished
8548908 i have not lost anyone from my own family just my best friends who i used to meet up with
8548909 i know what youre going to say but i have to ask it anyway have you ever taken class a drugs
8548910 ive answered this question in the way that i choose to which is to say that i believe all politicians have the right to a private past
8548911 weve all had to drive the porcelain bus at some stage

8548913 foolishness you lot open and youll all be dead by lunchtime
8548914 russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8548915 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8548916 medvedevs unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8548917 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8548918 we dont want a new cold war he has a big responsibility not to start one
8548919 my visit is designed to send a simple message we have not forgotten our commitments to you
8548920 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8548921 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8548922 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8548923 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8548924 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8548925 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8548926 usually we find a body and have to investigate a murder this time we got a murder and had to find a body
8548927 serious signal for those are trying to justify the aggression
8548928 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8548929 was not a step taken lightly or without full consideration of the consequences
8548930 relations between nations living under one roof need to be handled with the utmost sensitivity
8548931 reconciled itself to the loss of 14 former soviet republics which became states in their own right
8548932 immediately stripped its autonomous regions of abkhazia and south ossetia of their autonomy
8548933 fears and aspirations of the south ossetian and abkhazian peoples
8548934 the continued russian presence in georgia outside of abkhazia and south ossetia for example in poti represents a significant violation of the six point plan agreement
8548935 in other words are we going to rise to the occasion and be able to do it yes you always have contingency plans vis vis planes vis vis buses vis vis whos going to man the various desks in the campaign but i would say were in quite a good position to run a good campaign
8548936 the public needs to know when did the government know listeriosis had caused a death
8548937 hampton says the first case was in june we have cases every month and unfortunately some do die
8548938 those who know this business say that was very fast
8548939 if it comes off like a rock concert with no more depth than a rock concert then hell have failed
8548940 these images work they invoke the ancient greeks and the founding fathers were big on these guys
8548941 mccain has painted him as an empty headed celebrity not ready to govern
8548942 he cant let this take if he does hes in trouble
8548943 i expect to hear barack obama talk about what can happen with our nation
8548944 hes going to stress how important it is to get health care for all children to care for our environment and to protect the middle classs working wages
8548945 my expectation would be that we will have another minority government i think that is the reality of the current political environment
8548946 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8548947 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8548948 but he knows the idea of a conservative majority scares people the minute they talk openly about wanting a majority theyve got a problem because canadians start asking about their agenda
8548949 i would have thought wanting to govern the country was a larger project for mr harper
8548950 in his mind the conservatives could pick up a few seats and whittle away at the liberals that shows what they are all about
8548951 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8548952 we have an increasingly difficult parliamentary situation because we have increasingly divergent views on a range of issues whether its the economy the environment the criminal justice system the view of our country in the world
8548953 we think are wrong headed not well thought out not well balanced and also reflect a rather poor record of his party when he was in office on these matters
8548954 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8548955 there are growing security challenges in the arctic i think we are all aware that russian challenges are among them
8548956 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
8548957 we intend to double our jurisdiction to 200 nautical miles the full extent of canadas exclusive economic zone as recognized under the united nations convention on the law of the sea
8548958 this will give us jurisdiction over an additional half million square kilometres of arctic waters roughly the equivalent to the land mass of one of the prairie provinces
8548959 but more specifically it raises the potential of environmental threats like oil spills poaching and contamination that are particularly acute in the sensitive arctic ecosystem
8548960 we have a very good piece of legislation with the arctic waters pollution prevention act and then we followed it up with this silliness of not making it mandatory to report
8548961 the problem of course is as climate change takes effect as resource development occurs there is going to be more and more people
8548962 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8548963 the current administrations foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8548964 its time to put force on the table and use it
8548965 the war in georgia is no longer about that country alone
8548966 it has become a question of whether and how the west will stand up for the rights of free people throughout the region
8548967 i am ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time
8548968 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8548969 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8548970 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8548971 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8548972 its cost her her future unless there is a miracle
8548973 no child deserves this but especially not this one shes a brilliant brilliant girl with aspirations to pursue sports medicine
8548974 shes lost all functions below that level use of arms and legs bowel and bladder control
8548975 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8548976 in the end my candidate didnt win but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8548977 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8548978 which is the biggest city in england never to have had a top flight football team
8548979 whats the name of the english club none of whose letters you can colour in
8548980 those plum check cotton drawstring trousers are going to be absolutely massive
8548981 how you perceive and interpret what goes on around you affects longevity
8548982 never sullied by vulgarity although she may be surrounded by it
8548983 a primed weapon in the service of a trivial and material goal
8548984 put myself out but ren e it is you who have done me good all these years
8548985 in the end life and death are only the consequences of how well or how poorly you have made your construction
8548986 i excelled at nothing and little has changed since then
8548987 i was and remain superhumanly flatulent and adept at snarling farts that sent my sister and later my schoolfriends into paroxysms of mirth
8548988 sacked three times and spent nearly 20 years as a freelance writer and editor worked for six publishers two literary agents and three magazines and written reviews articles and obituaries for more newspapers and magazines than i can begin to remember
8548989 raised voices angry tirades office vendettas and the cries of wounded underlings
8548990 were not conducive to hard or pleasant work but it would be wrong to blame my failures as a publisher on the termagants in charge i loved the social side but i was never prepared to commit myself to it as fully as i should
8548991 i remember him springing on to one of the chatto lavatories
8548992 to demonstrate how making the best of a bad job he always squatted rather than sat in the firing position
8548993 the most glamorous and intelligent of publishers a worldly empurpled renaissance pontiff adrift at a methodist meeting

8549031 in a number of cases we make ex gratia payments in addition to the statutory compensation where an employee has no standing for some technicality we pay compensation as it appears desirable to deal with the problem on broad lines and not to rely on some legal point in our favour
8549032 we have over the years been able to talk our way out of claims but we have always recognised that at some stage solicitors of experience would with the advance in medical knowledge and the development of the law recognise there is no real defence to these claims and take us to trial

8549107 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8549108 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list

8549144 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8549145 the proliferation of international shipping in the north raises the potential for shipwrecks smuggling illegal immigration and even threats to national security
8549146 but more specifically it raises the potential of environmental threats like oil spills poaching and contamination
8549147 this will give us jurisdiction over additional area roughly equivalent to the land mass of one of the prairie provinces
8549148 we have no tv ads that are airing right now
8549149 it gives you an advantage because you can prepare internally without letting on in an attempt to catch your opponents off guard
8549150 in the context of modern politics thats a pretty significant advantage
8549151 fixed election dates prevent governments from calling snap elections for short term political advantage
8549152 they level the playing field for all parties and the rules are clear for everybody
8549153 we have an increasingly difficult parliamentary situation because we have increasingly divergent views on a range of issues whether its the economy the environment the criminal justice system the view of our country in the world
8549154 those will obviously all be issues on which the various parties will contrast their positions when we get into an actual election campaign
8549155 there was an escape plan we dont know whether that intelligence came from staff or inmates we do know it went all the way up the chain of command all the way to the executive director of correctional operations
8549156 there was lots of rumble out there that something was going to happen
8549157 what happened was the inmates refused to co operate with staff when they were trying to enter the unit so it took some time for staff to get into the unit and then clear the inmates out it wasnt a riot it was more unco operative in nature
8549158 im throwing in loose games on my serve im not consistent from the baseline and im finding it very difficult to focus on the court
8549159 we gt cannot reasonably draw any relevant conclusions from this data

8549161 about 50 of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
8549162 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
8549163 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency
8549164 one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but we can always make it better
8549165 thats why were investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and have already hired 200 more inspectors with more to come
8549166 there has to be a shared responsibility there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible
8549167 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8549168 ich habe einen schrank voll fair gehandelter t shirts habe meine ikea m bel aussortiert und gehe nicht mehr zu mcdonalds
8549169 as i turn around to look our vehicle is hit right beside me by the black suv
8549170 i was shocked didnt know what to do i didnt expect that
8549171 i was petrified i felt trapped and i also felt helpless there was no real way that i could get out
8549172 during that time i could hear shouting i dont know who it was i dont know what was being said
8549173 is it true you were angry about the chase and the damage to the police vehicle and in the heat of the moment you opened fire
8549174 during the pursuit he was very calm and almost relaxed his voice was very calm and he was very calm i noted that because i probably wouldnt have been
8549175 i was giving orders to mr campbell and saw him handle the gear shift reverse then handle the gear shift again and accelerate toward me
8549176 after this happened you knew this was a serious transgression and that you could be facing serious consequences
8549177 you had every reason to lie to protect yourself from responsibility
8549178 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october
8549179 i just tried to keep us in the game thats all i can do

8549181 parents need to be aware of the circumstances and be listening for information
8549182 a strategy is being put together and we will be ready at the school level to respond my goal at the moment is to be sure of accommodating any request or expectation
8549183 at this stage we wont be providing immunization clinics but through the provincial health officer we will be monitoring any potential cases that we see in schools and providing those immunization opportunities should the need arise
8549184 i believe that parents always want what is best for their kids though they make different decisions around immunizations
8549185 if theres an outbreak and your kids not immunized keep them home dont just continue to spread the virus around ideally this should be a quarantine issue
8549186 they do it for hepatitis and the boosters you know polio and whatnot they do it at school so why not mumps
8549187 the district was very good and active a few months ago about immunization so i was happy about that
8549188 i havent had any concerns addressed to me for chilliwack its been in the paper for quite a few months
8549189 that being the case we would be offering clinics on a routine basis but i think what well be doing particularly in vancouver is looking for cases and if we start to see cases well start taking more proactive measures

8549213 en la cuba castrista peligrosidad predelictiva simplemente significa que uno se atrevi a criticar al r gimen castrista o hablar lo que piensa que solo a 90 millas de nuestras costas en el comienzo del siglo 21 puede existir tanta opresi n y desacato total por los derechos humanos no solo es incomprensible pero tambi n bochornoso para las democracias de la regi n y del mundo qu tiene que ocurrir en la cuba comunista para que el mundo despierte de su estupor y comprenda que 11 millones de personas est n sufriendo todos los d as por la maldad de un grupo gobernante que no le importa el bienestar del pueblo le urjo a la comunidad europea a nuestros aliados en latinoam rica y a todas las organizaciones respetables de derechos humanos que condenen este arbitrario arresto y demanden la inmediata libertad del sr guila y los otros presos pol ticos tambi n le pido a nuestros aliados que reten al r gimen y lo confronten sobre el incremento de la represi n desde que ra l castro formalmente tomo el poder de su convaleciente hermano s estoy completamente de acuerdo que cuba ha cambiado desde que el tirano menor entro al poder pero el cambio ha sido mas represi n mas abuso aumento de la opresi n mas hambre menos oportunidades econ micas para la juventud menos alimentos para las familias y sin duda mas frustraci n en la poblaci n que se encuentra acorralada y sin saber hacia donde dirigirse esa es la nueva y mejorada cuba bajo ra l castro

8549221 i join the people of guam in mourning the deaths of sgt brian leon guerrero and spc samson mora who were fatally injured in afghanistan
8549222 we are currently interviewing applicants that have submitted their resumes to the board for the position of general manager
8549223 as we attempt to provide nutritious snacks and sandwich items for the kids we just cant keep up with the demand
8549224 were pushing really hard to place horses in new homes but were having trouble even coming up for air
8549225 i get weekly requests from people asking me to take pregnant mares the economy is having a really big impact
8549226 i think to some extent the voters were not aware of how significant this revenue is to the overall operations of the city
8549227 i think people do value the services the city offers but with these results we are going to have to re examine our budget
8549228 so thats where the cuts happen you cant cuts things like the water department
8549229 this is a tough time to ask voters for money
8549230 the voters spoke and i think we all hear their concerns
8549231 whether its a concern that the citys not doing enough to bring in business or the citys spending too much money on the tannery arts center
8549232 maybe the city does need to change the way it does business or it needs to do a better job of explaining
8549233 weve had a couple of incidents and then the chp has responded to a couple of crashes involving minors and alcohol
8549234 thats a lot to keep track of when our officers are handling over 60 000 calls for service per year on average
8549235 this grant will allow us to have the manpower on an overtime basis to focus our efforts and resources effectively in order to attack the problem
8549236 the police department wants to use deterrence more effectively while increasing education and enforcement at the same time
8549237 but theyve seen them feeding up the river as far as paradise park beyond harvey west
8549238 the larger the animal the more field lines the body will intercept and these lines are additive
8549239 were working on ways to apply our technology in saltwater but its more challenging
8549240 last night was the calmest night weve seen since we started the directed enforcement there
8549241 we had more cars go through the dui checkpoint than weve had in the last year
8549242 so many people wanted this to happen but they were so skeptical
8549243 having those funds is really important to investing in long term facilities that are going to serve kids hopefully for 20 or 30 years
8549244 this is a real lasting improvement for santa cruz high and hopefully for the community
8549245 its ok its going to be good in two days im sure
8549246 after that happened i was thinking more of it than i was really actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal at that moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle but its going to be all right
8549247 that was kind of a turning point in my career last year playing the final of the u s open and i started believing more after the final that i really can win
8549248 i knew it was a matter of time i just needed to work hard and really dedicate myself to it thats what i did i had the best season so far in my career and i have a different approach to the tournament to the grand slams because as a grand slam winner you feel a little relief and you gain much more confidence
8549249 its tough to say about federer because he was already so many years no 1 and winning every grand slam
8549250 and this year was not so great for him maybe hes tired you cant forever be no 1 you know and finish no 1
8549251 i try to keep my confidence on a high level and always be motivated to win
8549252 i had a lot of success but still there is many years to come and if im healthy enough i want to win more grand slams
8549253 there were visible emotions on the faces of the jurors when they watched the confession
8549254 that was the key piece of the states evidence he spoke for himself for the jury he showed them
8549255 what you watch on that video is a very casual conversation about a very tragic event
8549256 it wasnt just the confession there was plenty of supporting evidence
8549257 michael told the biggest lie of his life on that video thats what happened here
8549258 air was not getting into his lungs the blanket was not on his face michael wilson was not doing anything to that boy
8549259 what happened in this case theres a lot of medical malpractice
8549260 with the net we send everything from our central import point and save thousands weekly
8549261 im so thankful that many online gaming economy industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine
8549262 and eventually i want to start my own online gaming economy business that will parallel my work in hollywood
8549263 i like the idea of having a online gaming economy conference in our town but cant sleep at night with all them creating a rucus
8549264 it wasnt so bad last year but last night i didnt get to bed until 3 am with all the shananigans going on
8549265 im really impressed by the presentation prendergast mcdivitt did about up and coming online gaming economy businesses the reasoning was solid plenty of detail was provided and some of the conclusions were very provocative

8549288 i gained a lot of new knowledge a relief that there are people working on gender and climate change issues that are asking the difficult questions that it is not just as some of the web sites i have visited appear to indicate about homogenised vulnerable woman
8549289 we had an idea we might struggle early in the game because of so much youth starting five freshmen on defense after ethan huff got injured we ended up with six on the field its a big jump from wednesday afternoon games to friday night ones
8549290 we started slow but as the game progressed the younger kids got into the speed and pace of it and played well from about the middle of the second quarter through the third quarter
8549291 we talked at halftime without any yelling or screaming about how it was time to start playing with some confidence to forget the butter flies and try to concentrate on their assignment i wasnt concerned about them playing hard we knew they would do that
8549292 they social circle lost 7 6 in a scrimmage with putnam last friday and they look like they have for the last two years with a little better than average speed they have a big lineman whos being recruited by several large schools
8549293 the quarterback runs their offense well in a winged t formation for the most part defensively they have a couple of young players but they seem to run to the ball well and tackle well when they get there i anticipate a real close hard fought ball game
8549294 theres always a few new wrinkles you can put in but we are just so short on depth

8549306 i suppose i could try putting some all bran in a roll with maybe a fried egg and just the one bit of black pudding
8549307 this is a fantastic record cash position which can give us enormous opportunities in case we go for acquisition or other things we would like to do
8549308 we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team the positive was that we played a little better than recently we want to win trophies but we also understand the need for money
8549309 i was delighted that dirk kuyt scored the goal his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side his goal was a reward for all the effort he puts in for us he is amazing
8549310 we have to give credit to kuyt because sometimes when he makes a mistake people highlight it
8549311 but you could see for the 120 minutes how hard he works and he is an amazing player for every team he never hides and is the kind of player who is very important and he is a fantastic professional
8549312 im disappointed because gerrard will have an operation on thursday he has a groin problem we knew it could be like this
8549313 he needs to have it because he is having pain with it when he went with the national team we knew he had a problem and in the first leg too i was talking with the doctor on tuesday and on wednesday we talked with him he said he would play with pain and after it he would have an operation
8549314 we are very sad after that result over two matches we have been the best organised team and we deserved better than to lose like that in the final minutes
8549315 we have produced a high standard in both matches and now i hope that can be continued in our league matches and the uefa cup i sometimes wondered whether the referee was affected by the fact that we were playing a big team i felt we should have had a couple of penalties

8549413 cualquier duda acerca de por qu rusia invadi georgia se han disipado
8549414 reconociendo ilegalmente los territorios georgianos de abjazia y osetia del sur dmitry medvedev el presidente ruso dej claro que la meta de mosc es la de redibujar el mapa de europa usando la fuerza
8549415 esta guerra nunca ha sido sobre osetia del sur o georgia
8549416 mosc est usando su invasi n preparada durante a os para reconstruir su imperio conseguir mayor poder en el suministro energ tico de europa y castigar a aquellos que creen que la democracia puede florecer en sus fronteras
8549417 donde occidente actu para prevenir la limpieza tnica la limpieza tnica de georgia est siendo usada por rusia para consolidar su anexi n militar
8549418 el pr ximo paso en el gui n de la invasi n rusa de desinformaci n y anexi n es un cambio de r gimen
8549419 si mosc puede expulsar al gobierno de georgia elegido democr ticamente entonces puede intimidar a otros gobiernos europeos
8549420 el mensaje est claro rusia har lo que le plazca
8549421 all the issues have been resolved and deliveries to all the affected properties will continue
8549422 we will welcome mr dixon back in two or three months for a monitoring report
8549423 we will be having a site visit to the areas next week along with the householders to ensure that if there are road repairs needed they will be done under a health and safety remit and in a partnership agreement with royal mail
8549424 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8549425 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line
8549426 we believe we have found a good amount of equipment that is used for manufacturing methamphetamine two people a male and a female will be interviewed about that and we will be doing a scene examination at the wakefield address
8549427 well be interviewing all the people related to the addresses and see what comes out of that
8549428 i havent seen anything going on although over the last two days theres been a few cars coming and going late at night
8549429 so when we are dealing with these sorts of things we make sure its covered
8549430 working closely with our housing unit and the sergeant in charge as well as managers of the developments this unit will develop intelligence needed to locate and remove criminals that do not belong in these developments and secure search warrants to rid these developments of guns and drugs
8549431 to assure that occupants can feel safe within their homes and share information
8549432 the vast majority of people who live in our housing developments are law abiding citizens
8549433 the recent focus on these developments however has brought the director of housing and i together in partnership to strategize on how to assure the safety and well being of tenants throughout the city
8549434 i think we have some proactive policies that weve developed here
8549435 our public housing developments and the many law abiding people who reside in them are just as entitled to our best efforts at safety and protection as any neighborhood in our city
8549436 i applaud chief souza and mr collins for working seriously just as they always have to find new ways to collaborate and utilize resources to the best interest of our residents
8549437 we talk to the kids all the time about stopping this player or that player but more importantly we need to do our own jobs
8549438 more than anything else we need to be more disciplined on both sides of the ball everyone needs to concentrate on their own assignments first
8549439 i guess paying more attention to detail is the best way of putting it
8549440 with everything that went on during the week to get the win was just a rewarding experience
8549441 the reality is when you add up our offensive penalties and the yards those penalties negated by our math it was around 150 yards
8549442 we cant do that against orrville we need to sustain drives and keep their skill off the field we cant have those drive killers
8549443 their offense is us they do exactly what we do and the quarterback can run and throw
8549444 they also have 10 seniors starting on offense and nine on defense and you just dont find that thats great experience we have to respect
8549445 so yeah weve got to stop the quarterback and negate their wide receivers no 5 kenny goldstein and no 11 stephan shehy and we have to pick up their blitzes on defense
8549446 but more importantly its like bobby knight said we have to take care of ourselves first as long as we take care of our business we can compete with anyone
8549447 orrville forces you to defend the entire field both the width and depth and with besancons ability to scramble it puts even more pressure on the defense
8549448 that makes it almost like basketball in that you have to play man to man defense and from a skill standpoint across the board they are pretty darn good thatll be a challenge
8549449 nothing against west holmes but this is going from the frying pan to the fire
8549450 this is my third year here and i dont know any different the kids dont either
8549451 we have to be prepared as a team to play our very best each week and this week is certainly no exception
8549452 i dont think people knew you could use it for residential properties

8549456 it was believed the injuries to the child were minor and given the weather conditions and type of area we determined further searching would not produce results

8549458 we act as the fiscal agent for boys village school
8549459 this is a terrific example of a partnership with tri county
8549460 normally the compensation would be closer to 70 000 for a one year contract
8549461 they played saturday night and we got the chance to see watch them in person
8549462 and likewise they saw us friday i made the comment last year that it was one of the most physical games i have ever been a part of
8549463 their kids really bring it i think last year they really taught us what playoff intensity means and we learned a lot from that game
8549464 ridgway is an incredible athlete and well prepare to be ready for him at running back or quarterback
8549465 corey just continues to get better and better through his hard work
8549466 it didnt look good when they scored on their second play of the game but we were able to match the score and get three more in the first half
8549467 its nice to be able to start that way but wait until next week if we do the same thing against tuslaw then ill be ecstatic
8549468 obviously a lot of people played well to do that
8549469 if you take care of the nickles and dimes the dollars will take care of themselves
8549470 does discrimination trump free press or does free press trump discrimination
8549471 if there is some sort of discrimination that comes out in the reporting that is arguably contrary to the code then i would also feel that it would be open to a complainant to challenge the reporting as being discriminatory on the grounds of race
8549472 at the end of the day these are unelected bureaucrats who will have some pretty serious decision making power

8549476 in the very beginning of episode one he really goes through some horrible stuff and it completely changes him
8549477 in the first season my intention was to almost frustrate people by not giving them the savior or hero of the world that they were looking for i wanted him to be weak and young and slightly immature and impulsive
8549478 but this year the hero that will eventually save the world will emerge and it doesnt happen just by accident
8549479 i think we feel a little bit more confident this year because weve established ourselves as our own entity
8549480 before we were so concerned about staying true to the film which we still are but i think we feel that we can be more experimental now and more confident in taking risks
8549481 the emergence of asche tonight was a big lift for our team tonight
8549482 it was nice to have sarah back although she is still only about 50 percent
8549483 if you watched the first two games you wouldnt think much but we got better and we are getting better and learning we have a lot of young players this season
8549484 we know of no other material that combines similarly outstanding tribological properties over a wide temperature range with such low space requirement and light weight
8549485 we design the vespel thrust washers used in our itcs to last a lifetime operating with pv values of over 7 mpaxm s in other words the reduction in thickness that the thrust washers sustain due to wear is so low that they never need to be changed throughout the entire vehicle service life the axial positioning of the gear wheels remains within close tolerances and the formation of an optimum lubricating film is guaranteed

8549489 die forschung zu den gesundheitsgefahren der mobilfunkstrahlung muss weiter gehen und die grenzwerte m ssen gesenkt werden

8549518 it is well known that indigenous australians are incarcerated at a far greater rate than non indigenous australians with indigenous australians comprising nearly half of prisoners whose most serious offence or charge was an act intended to cause injury
8549519 the study showed that indigenous prisoners were more likely to have been convicted of violent offences previously and to return to prison for violent offences
8549520 most interviewed indigenous prisoners and ex prisoners found violent offending and substance abuse programs that they had participated in while in prison were useful however based on stakeholder comments it was concluded that the delivery of programs and services could be improved particularly post release
8549521 half of the indigenous prisoners in the data sample were released at the expiry of their sentence which makes on going support and supervision a challenge key areas that emerged from the consultations included the need to involve families and communities in throughcare attracting more resources in remote areas and for programs in prison and in the community to be more culturally specific without negatively affecting program integrity

8549525 the russian side has stressed the need for tbilisi to carry out point four of the medvedev sarkozy plan under which all georgian troops should be returned to their original bases
8549526 mr medvedev and mr sarkozy also discussed additional agreements which may in future ensure safety in the areas near the borders of south ossetia and abkhazia
8549527 no one ever doubted that a russian army of up to 800 000 people was going to defeat a georgian army of up to 18 000 people

8549539 compared with systems running the windows operating system linux systems face a unique threat of compromise from bruteforce attacks against ssh servers that may be running without the knowledge of system owners operators
8549540 many linux distributions install the ssh service by default some without the benefit of an effective firewall thus otherwise conscientious system administrators who keep their systems fully patched may fall prey to a system compromise caused by a carelessly chosen password

8549553 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding his request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8549554 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle to keep the matter private
8549555 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8549556 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point at which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before cancelling the agreement at the 11th hour
8549557 since then he has played over 80 games for newcastle all james wanted was a deal that reflected his development and that was in line with newcastles transfer valuation of him
8549558 whilst james does have three years left on his current agreement it is common practice that when a young player signs a long term contract this is reviewed and improved on a regular basis with a players development but equally it protects the clubs position in regard to their transfer value
8549559 although the transfer request was handed in seven days ago james has been professional in keeping the matter private whilst giving strong performances for newcastle

8549575 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8549576 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8549577 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8549578 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8549579 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8549580 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8549581 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused

8549600 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8549601 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8549602 underlined the urgent necessity to lower tension and to fully apply the six points of the ceasefire agreement
8549603 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8549604 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8549605 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8549606 we have information of 1 692 dead and 1 500 injured as a result of the georgian aggression
8549607 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8549608 mr smith stated that it would only be through dialogue and a cooperative approach that tensions in the region and internationally would be reduced and a long term resolution of the issue achieved
8549609 we can confirm that fairfax newspapers will be published tomorrow as normal
8549610 this was a motion that arose spontaneously from the floor of the meeting because people are angry at the way the company has treated them both in terms of enterprise agreement negotiations and also the redundancy announcements he said
8549611 this would be the end of fairfax as we know it
8549612 its not possible to continue to produce the level of quality journalism fairfax is known for with 550 fewer staff
8549613 were determined to use every option we have to stop the company from screwing the business that some of these people have been worked 20 or 30 years for
8549614 they wanted to signal to management they want to be involved and negotiated with and consulted by the company as to what plans management has for fairfax media rather than be treated dismissively and communicated to by email
8549615 they believe the new management team that has come in since the merger with rural press is all about low cost and low quality journalism which isnt good for anyone
8549616 its not good for the paper not good for the journalists and not good for the communities they serve
8549617 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8549628 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia

8549630 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8549631 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8549632 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
8549633 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
8549634 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8549635 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8549636 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8549637 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8549638 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8549639 chile consagra formalmente una nueva mirada sobre la discapacidad que deber a contribuir a poner al d a nuestra legislaci n y nuestras pol ticas p blicas

8549642 la questione alitalia rappresenta una truffa colossale che a tratti durante questi tristi mesi di agonia della societa ha sconfinato anche nellillegalita oltre che far precipitare la gia poco rosea immagine internazionale di questo paese ai minimi storici
8549643 dopo aver preso ai cittadini 600 miliardi delle vecchie lire per un contributo a fondo perduto alla compagnia di bandiera oggi berlusconi e promotore interessato di una nuova compagnia che a costo zero sfrutta il marchio e le rotte del vettore alitalia scaricando i debiti sullo stato e su una miriade di piccoli azionisti che perderanno tutto

8549647 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8549648 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8549649 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8549650 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8549651 da werden wir noch ein bisschen dran zu knabbern haben ich denke nicht dass wir vier tore schlechter waren zum schluss haben wir zu fahrl ssig gespielt wir waren auch zu naiv
8549652 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8549653 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8549654 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8549655 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8549656 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8549657 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8549658 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo

8549661 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8549662 p rez yoma rechaz duramente el ultim tum de agricultores de la araucan a
8549663 agricultores de temuco dieron 10 d as a p rez yoma para visitar la zona
8549664 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8549665 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8549666 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8549667 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8549668 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8549669 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
8549670 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
8549671 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
8549672 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8549673 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8549674 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8549675 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8549676 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8549677 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8549678 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8549679 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8549680 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8549681 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
8549682 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
8549683 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
8549684 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8549685 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8549686 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8549687 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8549688 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8549689 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8549690 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8549691 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8549692 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8549693 todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso

8549695 se alaba que las c rceles concesionadas visit santiago 1 y rancagua est n en la primera l nea de lo que l ha visto en el continente no solamente en sudam rica
8549696 no hay en ning n caso en chile pr ctica de torturas ni en ning n caso permisividad o complacencia o hacer la vista a un lado en caso de malos tratos si es necesario son investigados y sancionados si corresponde
8549697 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene
8549698 se est trabajando con la canciller a se ha estado trabajando en una especie de acuerdo con el gobierno paname o
8549699 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8549701 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano

8549703 what looks like a nice mix of cheap effective veteran talent to go along with a competitive core of young players with a lot of upside and this may be the season that weve all been expecting from them since the birth of the franchise
8549704 she isnt best pleased it was hard enough for her to give up in real life and even inhaling smoke from herbal tobacco surely cant be a good thing for a mum to be
8549705 if youre smoking herbal cigarettes all youre doing is substituting the burning leaves of one sort of plant for another
8549706 people try them because they think that since they dont contain nicotine they are safer
8549707 a few months before cameron welsh the series producer called me and went through the storyline to make sure i was comfortable with it
8549708 this has been the biggest challenge for me as an actor even though martha has been through a lot
8549709 i researched the storyline with the help of a young girl called nikki dwyer who had breast cancer and our medical advisor wendy odonnell guided me through the medical and emotional side
8549710 liam cant bear the thought of losing carla and grabs her in her wedding gown
8549711 even though hes back with maria and they are planning a new baby he cant help himself
8549712 shes been with her mum in greece for two weeks apparently theres not actually been much mention of it but thats where shes been
8549713 katies at the village fayre giving horse rides to the kids but chas says to her something like none of the kids want to ride on the horses they just want to go on the donkeys so you may as well go back and get changed
8549714 so katie goes back to home farm to stable the horses and get changed when i walk in i find matthew being held hostage by a madman with a gun which was the last thing she was expecting
8549715 without giving too much away he wants to know where someone precious to him is and he wants to know whether it means harming katie or matthew in the process
8549716 it was actually a real gun but it didnt have any ammunition in it its a horrible feeling having it pointed at your head
8549717 i had to hold it at one point because theres a struggle in one scene and the guns dropped and katie gets it which is ridiculous really because the guns twice the size of me
8549718 this time we will not let the protesting teachers be unpaid like last year
8549719 things have got hot we are discontent with the entire management system of the government
8549720 eljeli smo ga prebaciti u bolju bolnicu u dhaki no njegova je obitelj toliko siroma na da si to nije mogla priu titi dijete su odveli ku i gdje je i umrlo

8549729 risultati disastrosi in caso di s della russia allindipendenza di abkhazia e ossezia del sud
8549730 i think we were unlucky and ive got more positives to come out of the day than negatives
8549731 obviously conceding two goals is a negative so we need to work on that and defend a little bit better in those instances
8549732 we had a mad five minutes just before half time and straight after half time but in terms of us starting the game i thought we were excellent
8549733 in the first 25 minutes they were finding it difficult to live with us we really passed the ball around with a lot of authority moved the ball very neatly and i thought it was all going to plan but unfortunately goals change games
8549734 it was just that killer instinct at the top end and whilst we hit the post twice it just didnt go in but thats football
8549735 their first goal was fortunate but you have to accept that and i still thought at half time when it was 1 1 if we kept playing as we did in the first 25 minutes we wouldnt have any problems
8549736 but unfortunately two or three minutes into the second half we got caught and it puts us on the back foot
8549737 obviously the lads are very disappointed but there are a lot more positives to take from the game and we just have to move on
8549738 technically and physically i thought we were in better shape and in terms of our rotation and moving the ball we were better than them but weve lost the game 2 1 and its harsh
8549739 its a lesson for the players about managing the game and staying in the game when youre winning 1 0
8549740 wir haben es in den sommermonaten mit einem saisonbedingten anstieg der arbeitslosigkeit zu tun

8549745 in the world that we live in i think we feel pretty good about that and i think that does show the robustness of the business and the portfolio
8549746 it is not enough that your legislature should be numerous it should also be divided
8549747 let me say first that i accept the nomination of the democratic party i accept it without reservation and with only one obligation the obligation to devote every effort of my mind and spirit to lead our party back to victory and our nation to greatness
8549748 if we open a quarrel between the present and the past we shall be in danger of losing the future
8549749 be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed
8549750 they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary
8549751 he was there on the webcam also he was showing the room he had a different kind of smile on his face that night
8549752 as a colonel you probably dont have to be on the front
8549753 if one of my soldiers has to be hurt it has to be over my dead body
8549754 for one year we shared the same tent same food he was like a mentor and was posted in siachen he was a fantastic leader the men under him were ready to do anything for him
8549755 a actual ministra da sa de parece ser uma honesta defensora do servi o nacional de sa de ter poder os sinais n o s o animadores
8549756 i will do all i can to improve those we have the problem is we have limited time but the guys are doing really well and i am impressed
8549757 we have reinforced all our departments but we have still been struggling to find a quality striker
8549758 in the few weeks he has trained with us sserunkuma has proved to be very good striker and thats why we didnt hesitate to sign him
8549759 muito perigoso h outros objetivos que se pode supor sejam os da r ssia em particular a crim ia a ucr nia e mold via
8549760 enquanto a r ssia enviou ajuda para regi es ucranianas afetadas por enchentes a ucr nia falhou em ajudar a r ssia a for ar a paz na ge rgia e adotou uma postura abertamente hostil
8549761 a coaliz o mais ampla poss vel contra a agress o russa na ge rgia
8549762 o presidente russo diz que n o tem medo de uma nova guerra fria n s n o queremos uma ele tem uma grande responsabilidade de n o iniciar uma
8549763 moscou agiu brutalmente na ge rgia mas quando os estados unidos e a gr bretanha apoiaram a independ ncia do kosovo sem a aprova o das na es unidas eles abriram caminho para a defesa russa da oss tia do sul e para a atual humilha o do ocidente
8549764 he has been a true athlete there is nothing to say about california molefe 400m since he was injured
8549765 the boy is currently under g4s sponsorship until 2012 and we hope that he will improve
8549766 i think that if he would have remained in kenya he would have done better but the boy ran fantastic times in europe around may this year
8549767 most of his opponents are around 33 and 34 years and he is only 23 he will definitely improve he has just started training in germany and that will help him a lot
8549768 she ran very well although she could not sustain the explosive pace of her opponents but it is something that she will work on
8549769 it was the first time that swimmers competed at the olympics and they have improved their personal times like amantle in the 2004 athens olympics they qualified through wild card and we can hope that they improve like amantle did this year we expect the exposure to propel them further
8549770 its really an emergent field and the university has been quick to recognize that
8549771 grad programs seemed like the next logical step and the big reason is that the students want to do it
8549772 every day im getting e mails from india from brazil from all these people who want to come and do our program
8549773 being in the kind of environment where im being exposed to a lot of different people who are all looking at issues of sexuality from different vantage points is valuable to me because it enriches and augments my own scholarship
8549774 i think therell be an english department or a drama department that doesnt have anyone with an expertise in sexual diversity or the important contribution gay men and women have made to the theatre
8549775 theres definitely a gap in the education and what can be said in the classroom
8549776 theres a lot of emphasis on race and health and gender and health but not so much on sexual diversity and health
8549777 i think some students would think that its too gay
8549778 the word scramble gave the impression that it was a little too haphazard
8549779 i think the city has made it clear over the last number of years that the no 1 priority is pedestrians no 2 is transit three is cyclists and four is the car
8549780 this is an experiment to see if pedestrians are able to benefit from this and if we are able to get drivers to cope
8549781 i was first told it was an eight round fight only to be told in the third round that the contest was left with only a round to go
8549782 i tried to put him down in the fourth but failed and so he went on to win
8549783 i am confident we shall bring everybody down we have worked so hard and i am happy the girls have got the confidence to carry us through

8549788 its just a store having the final say on what it sells and what it doesnt
8549789 we were not happy with the way the structures were run but we cannot blame the members may be we at the council also did not do enough to familiarise ourselves with the structures
8549790 it looks like when the movement started people had different expectations about it and when their expectations were not met many of them dropped out and that was something that alerted us that something was not right

8549833 the russian side has stressed the need for tbilisi to carry out point four of the medvedev sarkozy plan under which all georgian troops should be returned to their original bases
8549834 mr medvedev and mr sarkozy also discussed additional agreements which may in future ensure safety in the areas near the borders of south ossetia and abkhazia
8549835 no one ever doubted that a russian army of up to 800 000 people was going to defeat a georgian army of up to 18 000 people
8549836 the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that

8549884 the thing i hated most when i was a player was coach says you have to wear coat and tie you wear coat and tie you travel to some podunk place that has a horrible locker room
8549885 you just traveled there you have to undress go out and do 15 minutes of walk though get sweaty enough to take a shower
8549886 our thing is to make the traveling as easy and convenient as it possibly can be so the players can focus on the task at hand i cannot remember the last time we went to a stadium and did anything the friday before a game
8549887 and as all paranoid coaches youre worried about the other team watching you

8549904 it should take into consideration and provide for equitable means for the disabled people to access employment education health leisure and other social activities

8549918 torner talmente presto che non avrai il tempo di sentire la mia mancanza prenditi cura del mio cuore te lho lasciato
8549919 una cosa mi era chiara e la sentivo in fondo allo stomaco al centro delle ossa dalla punta dei capelli alla pianta dei piedi e nel mio petto vuoto chi ama ha il potere di distruggere e io ero stata distrutta sbriciolata

8549928 in response to the muddied result of the june election
8549929 without knowing what somebody is dissatisfied with we have no opportunity to change
8549930 its a whole lot easier to fix a problem if you define what it is
8549931 id like to know why what is it is it cost tell me if it is because the car is black lets paint it blue
8549932 should be exacting and the standard high but not impossible
8549933 people think horses that are at rescues are old lame half dead and broken down and thats not always the case
8549934 we named them that because like the bank they were a wreck and we knew they were going to cost a lot of money
8549935 i dont condone breeding not when there are so many unwanted horses out there
8549936 i spent that whole summer riding him it was what i needed to feel human again ive always loved horses but more as of late because now i feel that i owe them for my own sanity
8549937 its nice to see when theres a connection between somebody who adopts and the horse
8549938 sell them now give them away now because if they wait until this winter the rescues will not be able to help
8549939 were all in the same boat and as horse rescues we really should be working better as a community to promote our product which is the rescue horse
8549940 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8549941 the positive was that we played a little better than recently we want to win trophies but we also understand the need for money
8549942 strano sapevo di essere molto silenzioso ma non fino a questo punto
8549943 a volte capita anche a me di non accorgermi di qualcuno che ho vicino

8549945 we decided that steven would play through the pain against liege and then have the operation he may not be fit for the manchester united game but he certainly will be okay for the first group stage match next month
8549946 he has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days it is not serious but we need to do it now
8549947 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8549948 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8549949 muito perigoso h outros objetivos que se pode supor sejam os da r ssia em particular a crim ia a ucr nia e mold via

8549959 so as a result when we interview people we try to find out how their strengths and weaknesses can compliment our current team
8549960 look if they can get you for less they will offer you less the object of any negotiation is to settle on terms that are parties agree upon and when it comes to remuneration dont sell yourself short
8549961 and then was promoted to senior sales associate i worked this position for another year before moving to the executive marketing position i currently hold
8549962 ive seen many hot shots try to hit home runs with little experience without learning to simply get base hits and doubles first success comes with small steps and knowledge not one great play no matter how memorable
8549963 orines scerra an e gaming photographic images industry veteran was our top choice for vice president of sales and marketing
8549964 and we recruited heavily for this position basically we wanted someone with a lot of experience and sales experience
8549965 dont forget to talk about vacation time which is an essential component of any e gaming photographic images industry interview
8549966 if you want to make a big paycheck realize that youll have a more stressful life as a result make sure that you have time to relax each year be it one long vacation or shorter breaks throughout the year
8549967 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia

8549980 von diesen e3 ligasen gibt es fast tausend verschiedene in der pflanzenzelle sie werden ben tigt um jeweils spezielle proteine abzubauen
8549981 dahinter l sst sich eine gro e regulatorische kraft vermuten allerdings wissen wir momentan nur von wenigen dieser e3 ligasen welche proteine sie abbauen
8549982 das ging nur sehr langsam voran mit der genomsequenz und der mutantensammlung kann man deutlich schneller arbeiten die methode hei t reverse genetik diese vorgehensweise ist bei hefe und arabidopsis m glich nicht aber bei m usen und menschen
8549983 bei vielen pflanzlichen signalwegen liegen zwischen der erkennung des signals und dem abbau des proteins erstaunlich wenige zwischenschritte
8549984 wir konnten jetzt anhand unserer untersuchungen der arabidopsis mutanten des cop9 signalosoms zeigen dass diese mutanten defekte dna str nge haben und dies k nnte der grund f r das schlechte wachstum der mutanten sein man muss annehmen dass der ausfall desselben proteinkomplexes beim menschen auch zu einem wachstumsstopp aufgrund von dna sch den f hrt

8549993 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time i have been asked that
8549994 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8549995 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8549996 underlined the urgent necessity to lower tension and to fully apply the six points of the ceasefire agreement
8549997 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8549998 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8549999 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
