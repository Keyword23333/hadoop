650035 as per our information 30 children and 38 women have been killed
650036 in the first set i was quite satisfied with my tournament i just had yesterdays match on my mind and wasnt really focused on this match
650037 the rain delay after i lost the first set really helped me i went to the locker room and talked to my coach it wasnt easy to talk to him because he was really mad i realized if i just played my game i had a chance to win this match then in the second set i played like i should in the third it was a very high level of tennis
650038 winning my first title is still very far its still one match
650039 im so excited about this about my game that im in the final of a tier i for the first time i will try to play my best tomorrow and for sure i will be not satisfied with my week so far like i was today in the beginning
650040 i knew it would be tougher in the second set because she would try to play better after losing the first set
650041 me i slowed down and let her get back into the match i think i complicated it even more for myself but i still turned the match around in the third set and im really happy with that
650042 as you can see since the clay court season shes playing amazing
650043 i think shes playing like the no 1 player in the world
650044 shes a very tough opponent she proved that this week
650045 she has beaten some very good players its another match for me i just want to focus on myself playing my game and being aggressive and lets see whos gonna be stronger tomorrow she has her advantages and i have mine its going to come down to who uses them better tomorrow

650048 resistant to insect infestation such as termites because the feathers are inedible
650049 they are also not as flammable or combustible as conventional cement and wood fibre composite boards
650050 conventional waste disposal methods when applied to chicken feathers are problematic
650051 incineration releases greenhouse gases and the feathers take up a lot of space in landfills and take a long time to decay because of the keratin protein that make up the feathers
650052 there is also the fear of bird flu which makes converting chicken feathers into animal feeds undesirable
650053 this is simply a waste of talent and is not beneficial to students who should seek to learn the most at this stage of their lives
650054 this means bringing about a more responsible form of politics based on knowledge i dont think any political party will use street campaigning methods on campus because these are people with knowledge who will be able to make their own judgment
650055 hence student activism will attempt to boost student leaders knowledge in the sense that they will gain insights into the real world and are able to apply the knowledge learned in lectures and tutorials into management of real situations

650059 advised that the iiit nait north american islamic trust and all the subsidiary and sponsoring muslim organizations under the control of the iiit and the saar foundation are in fact ikhwan organizations
650060 as members of the ikhwan they are involved in organizing political support which involves influencing both public opinion in the united states as well as the united states government
650061 a list of our organizations and the organizations of our friends
650062 on the general strategic goal for the group in north america
650063 isna checks deposited into the isna nait account for the hlf were often made payable to
650064 to the point where it has set up political action front groups with no traceable ties to the iiit or its various muslim groups
650065 they also have claimed success in infiltrating the united states government with sympathetic of sic compromised individuals
650066 your client also will have to explain his response to alamoudis statements that everybody in the herndon group knew that al arian was pij how could alamoudi know that al arian was pij but not jamal barzinji when alamoudi was barzinjis aide back when the money was flowing from herndon to your clients organizations
650067 when we make a commitment to you or try to offer
650068 we do it for you as a group regardless of the party or the fa ade you use the donation for
650069 y our client might assert that the herndon targets did not know that he was involved with or affiliated with pij if he makes that assertion however to convince us of his honesty on this point he also will need to explain how fawaz damra openly could announce to the crowd at the islamic center of cleveland in april 1991 that your client was the head of the pij and that for security reasons pij was referred to here
650070 had favored and advocated for the islamic trend in palestine particularly the pij
650071 further since the herndon targets were founders of the muslim brotherhood in america and your client was at one time a member of the muslim brotherhood then if your client later quarreled with the muslim brotherhood we would have to be able to ask who at pij remained on good terms with the muslim brotherhood in order to ask about the connections between pij and the herndon targets outside of your client
650072 no knowledge regarding the internal structures or operations of iiit saar other related organizations or their finances i know of no incriminating information regarding anyone related to these organizations i know these individuals to be honorable loyal and conscientious citizens concerned about the well being of this country and all humanity at large furthermore during the entire period i have known these individuals i have never discussed with nor solicited iiit or other iiit related organizations or any individual involved with iiit or iiit related organizations for any financial support aid or contributions for or on behalf of any organizations based outside the u s including the palestinian occupied territories
650073 favored and advocated for the islamic trend in palestine particularly the pij i think that by extension the other individuals associated with iiit also knew that as well

650076 ive put my heart and soul into the job but my head is telling me to pack it in
650077 when i spoke to my dad this morning he said you can walk away a proud lad so i really want to thank my mum and dad
650078 i hope this decision will prolong my career hopefully this will make my last few years an exciting time i wont be at the oval i need a few weeks away from the game
650079 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
650080 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
650081 weve beaten new zealand twice but lost to three big teams i want to take this little break and then come back and finish the season for yorkshire
650082 i have to score runs like everyone else and put myself in the frame for selection i believe these will be the best years of my playing career i wont hit any balls for a few weeks but then i want to come back and score some runs
650083 it came as a huge surprise for the players the one regret is that i didnt stand in front of them yesterday they were completely gutted in the dressing room and i didnt have it in me i hope they respect my decision
650084 there have been people who i have talked to but once your mind is made up it is hard to go back ive always gone on my gut instinct ive played my best innings on gut instinct and this was the right time
650085 i havent been involved in any discussions over the new captain i just had to make this decision because it was the right one
650086 whoever gets the privilege to captain his country will need a bit of time to establish himself as a lead the england team really needs someone to lead them in the right direction
650087 ive tried to be me throughout the whole period as captain one of the things that has really hurt me in the last six months is that i havent been me
650088 a big disappointment for me is that i havent managed to get through to next year whoever gets the job will have about nine matches before the ashes so he will be inexperienced but will have fresh ideas
650089 he was undoubtedly the catalyst for regaining the ashes in 2005
650090 his legacy will be felt for many years to come we expect him to play a significant role in english cricket in the future
650091 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
650092 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
650093 the government is committed and i am sure so is the union to doing what is best for our students and our schools
650094 it is inevitable that if we keep talking and negotiating around that focus we will come to an agreement and resolve this dispute
650095 my initial reaction would be to speak to mr caica to see what offer they will put to us but it is good to hear he is confident it can be resolved
650096 it does seem a fairly positive statement and it is much more positive than the approach that the former industrial relations minister michael wright took and that can only be a good thing enough is enough and we are prepared to continue action right up until the next election if we have to
650097 no one wants to be on strike no one wants to lose productivity and no one wants to have a situation where children are not at school the quicker it is resolved the better it will be for everyone
650098 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it

650108 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
650109 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
650110 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
650111 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
650112 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
650113 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
650114 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
650115 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties

650152 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
650153 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
650154 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
650155 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
650156 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
650157 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
650158 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
650159 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
650160 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
650161 senator obama is an impressive orator and its a lucky thing for me that people arent just choosing a motivational speaker
650162 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
650163 it seems to me the only thing he wants us to do is inflate tires
650164 what john mccain has done in the last week has really shown the american people he doesnt want to talk about the economy or foreign policy or healthcare

650176 said jeffrey adamovicz former director of the bacteriology division at u
650177 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
650178 i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
650179 earnings in our upstream operations benefited from prices for crude oil that were significantly higher than a year ago
650180 what were seeing is a higher amount of demand decrease in the u s west coast than were seeing in other parts of the country

650183 clearly i think that on many levels of the political class this has support that other taxes for example the millionaires tax doesnt
650184 the millionaires tax raises more revenue solely from the super rich yet the political class in new york city the mayors office being the head of it comes back with congestion pricing again
650185 congestion pricing will come in new york and lots of other cities because it is the only way where you were going to do the two things that you need to do reduce people driving and find money for mass transit

650209 the pseudo occultism of the present day with its dubious psychism wild theorizing and evidence that cannot stand up to the most cursory examination is but the detritus which accumulates around the base of the mount of vision all such worthless rubbish is not worth the power and shot of argument in order to form a just estimate of the sacred science we must study originals and try to penetrate the minds of the great mystics whose works bear evidence of first hand knowledge of the supersensible worlds

650211 for most of us however we only think seriously of food or sex or money when it becomes a problem which is to say when we feel we are not getting our share when we find ourselves in that situation then i regret to say that meditational visualisations are really not the best way to remedy the lack we are here in a physical condition in a physical world and while in that state we have to abide by the laws appropriate to it

650235 the seventh day is like a palace in time with a kingdom for all it is not a date but an atmosphere
650236 the world would not be complete if the six days did not culminate in the sabbath geniba and the rabbis discussed this geniba said this may be compared to a king who made a bridal chamber which he plastered painted and adorned now what did the bridal chamber lack a bride to enter it similarly what did the universe still lack the sabbath

650289 the americans have conspired in a cover up of monumental and possibly even criminal proportions
650290 they hid photos of bare human footprints on the moon for 20 years and managed to keep the human skeleton secret even longer the implications of what they found up there are staggering
650291 but the americans apparently feel that nobody else in the world is privileged enough to share the information
650292 like the footprints on the moon these photos were taken by a remote camera aboard the lunar lander and were given to me by an american source who is beyond reproach
650293 i am also in the possession of classified documents and letters that describe the footprints as being fresh and the skeleton unquestionably human the question that must be answered is how the footprints and skeleton go to the moon the obvious implication is that extraterrestrial lifeforms were involved but well never know unless the americans release the information they have

650326 barangsiapa tidak meninggalkan perkataan dan perbuatan dusta maka allah tidak butuh terhadap puasanya dari makan dan minum
650327 puasa adalah perisai bila suatu hari seseorang dari karna berpuasa hendaknya ia tidak berkata buruk dan berteriak teriak bila seseorang menghina atau mencacinya hendaknya ia berkata sesungguhnya aku sedang puasa

650335 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
650336 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
650337 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
650338 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
650339 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
650340 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
650341 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
650342 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
650343 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
650344 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

650379 wahai rasulullah saya lupa sehingga makan dan minum padahal saya sedang berpuasa
650380 sempurnakan puasamu dan kamu tidak wajib mengqadhanya sesungguhnya allah telah memberimu makan dan minum
650381 aku juga pernah mendapati shubuh dalam keadaan junub lantas aku berpuasa
650382 demi allah sungguh aku berharap agar aku menjadi orang yang paling takut kepada allah dan paling tahu akan sesuatu yang bisa dijadikan alat bertakwa
650383 wahai rasulullah saya mampu berpuasa dalam perjalanan apakah saya berdosa
650384 ia adalah rukhshah keringanan dari allah barangsiapa mengambilnya baik baginya dan barangsiapa lebih suka berpuasa maka ia tidak berdosa
650385 hal itu kembali kepada dirimu tergantung kemampuanmu bagaimana pendapatmu jika salah seorang di antara kamu mempunyai tanggungan hutang lalu mencicilnya dengan satu dirham dua dirham tidakkah itu merupakan bentuk pelunasan allah maha pemaaf dan pengampun
650386 wahai rasulullah ibu saya telah meninggal sedangkan ia berhutang puasa nadzar bolehkah saya berpuasa untuknya
650387 bagaimana pendapatmu jika ibumu memiliki tanggungan hutang lantas kamu lunasi bukankah itu membuat lunas hutangnya la berkata benar
650388 adapun berkumur dan memasukkan air ke rongga hidung adalah disyariatkan hal ini sesuai dengan kesepakatan para ulama
650389 berlebih lebihanlah kamu dalam menghirup air ke hidung kecuali jika kamu sedang berpuasa
650390 puasa seseorang tidak batal sebab mengenakan celak injeksi suntik zat cair yang diteteskan di saluran air kencing mengobati luka luka yang tembus sampai ke otak dan luka tikaman yang tembus ke dalam rongga tubuh ini adalah pendapat sebagian ulama lihat al ikhtiyaraatul fiqhiyah hlm 10
650391 jika ia meninggal sebelum membayar puasa wajibnya seperti orang yang meninggal dalam keadaan berhutang puasa ramadhan kemudian diberikan kepadanya kesehatan namun dia belum sempat menunaikannya maka waijb baginya memberi makan kepada satu orang miskin setiap hari sesuai dengan jumlah puasa yang ia tinggalkan
650392 barangsiapa meninggal dunia sedangkan in punya tanggungan puasa maka walinya boleh berpuasa menggantikannya
650393 para ulama berbeda pendapat tentang mayit yang memiliki tanggungan puasa wajib seperti puasa ramadhan qadha dan nadzar ataupun yang lain apakah wajib diqadha untuknya
650394 anak yang belum dewasa jika ia mampu berpuasa maka pantas diperintah melaksanakannya dan bila meninggalkannya diberi hukuman
650395 orang yang makan di siang hari bulan ramadhan atau minum harus diberi pelajaran dengan hukuman supaya jera
650396 semua aroma yang tercium oleh orang yang sedang menunaikan ibadah puasa tidak membatalkan puasanya kecuali bau rokok jika ia menciumnya dengan sengaja maka batallah puasanya tetapi jika asap rokok masuk ke hidungnya tanpa disengaja tidak membatalkan sebab amat sulit untuk menghindarinya wallahu alam
650397 bagaimana amalku akan menyelamatkan diriku sementara aku terdampar diantara kebaikan amp keburukan sungguh keburukan amalku tak ada sedikitpun kebaikan padanya dan sungguh amal kebaikanku tengah dikungkungi oleh noda hitam keburukan amalku sedangkan engkau yaa rabb tidak menerima kecuali apa yg terbit dari ikhlasnya amal maka pupuslah harapan dan tak ada lagi yg tersisa setelah ini semua melainkan rahmat amp maghfirah mu

650424 economic conditions have deteriorated badly since may with business and consumer confidence weakening significantly
650425 we now expect overall visits to fall by 2 7 percent in 2008 and by 1 2 percent in 2009 visit spending is anticipated to grow by less than inflation in both years
650426 although strong visitor growth since 2005 does mean london is facing this slowdown from a position of relative strength there are significant risks that this slowdown could be more severe than predicted
650427 there could be no doubt as to alexanders successor hildebrand later called gregory vii had been virtually pope during two pontificates the efforts of the clugny party against simony and clerical marriage had been inspired by him though he had begun his career as the chaplain of a simoniacal pope
650428 gregorys character was in many respects a grand and noble one but impartial history decides that the good he accomplished was far more than counterbalanced by his fanatical enforcement of celibacy q v which has continued to this day to demoralize the romanist clergy and by his semi blasphemous assertions of almost divine power for the papacy his earlier efforts for ecclesiastical reform were no doubt sincere and earnest but at a later period he was led astray b the ambition of exalting his see over all the dignities and powers of the earth spiritual as well as temporal not content with making as far as in him lay the church independent of the empire and at the same time establishing the control of the papal authority over the princes of the earth objects which he left to be completed by his successor gregory determined to destroy the independence of the various national churches his object was to raise the pope to supreme power over church and state throughout christendom by a constitution of his predecessor alexander ii which he dictated and which he afterwards continued it was enacted for the first time that no bishop elect should exorcise his functions until lie had received his confirmation from the pope the roman see had already in the 9th century subverted the authority of the metropolitans under pretense of affording protection to the bishops but now it assumed the right of citing the bishops without distinction before its tribunal at rome to receive its dictates and gregory obliged the metropolitan to attend in person to receive the pallium the quarrel of anselm archbishop of canterbury with william rufus was owing to that monarch not choosing to let him go to rome whither he had been summoned the practice of sending apostolic legates to different kingdoms as special commissioners of the pope with discretionary power over the national hierarchy originated also with gregory and completed the establishment of absolute monarchy in the church in lieu of its original popular or representative form this doctrine of papal absolutism in matters of discipline was by prescription and usage so intermixed with the more essential doctrines of faith that it came to be considered a dogma itself and has defied all the skill of subsequent theologians and statesmen to disentangle it from the rest while at the same time it has probably been though at a fearful cost the means of preserving the unity of the western or roman church the measures accomplished and attempted by gregory were 1 the abolition of the influence of the roman nobility in the election of the pope 2 the removal of all authority in the election of the popes from the emperors of germany 3 the establishment of the celibacy of the clergy 4 the freedom of the church in the matter of investitures

650435 read all about it the corporate takeover of americas newspapers
650436 the bircherite faction of the family the folks who thought otis chandler publisher from 1960 to 1980 and credited with the papers widely admired and prosperous professionalization was a pinko
650437 youve no idea how fast these folks are strip mining the place theyve already carted away millions of dollars their efforts to attract advertising and grow the business have come to nothing theyre midwestern white men obsessed with only two things the chicago cubs and accounting they care nothing for journalism they are philistines
650438 philistines is perfect characterization for that crowd only the philistines as a group were smarter you cannot imagine how intellectually inferior three of the last four chairmen of tribune co were
650439 is a street smart town cops crooks restaurateurs developers writers they are bold and wily the business executives on the other hand are weak and moronic
650440 is she from d c did we have drinks with her recently or something
650441 oh my gosh i know her too maybe we saw her in a movie
650442 it is my aim and it is my hope that we will witness a grand jury investigation with reporters present being asked to reveal who is leaking this information i believe the safety of this nation and the people of this country deserve nothing less
650443 before running the story we gave long and sober consideration to the administrations contention that disclosing the program would damage the countrys counterterrorism efforts
650444 we were not convinced then and have not been convinced since that our reporting compromised national security
650445 what our reporting has done is set off an intense national debate about the proper balance between security and liberty a debate that many government officials of both parties and in all three branches of government seem to regard as in the national interest
650446 what the new york times has done is nothing less than to compromise the centerpiece of our defensive efforts in the war on terrorism
650447 im not going to get into specific laws that are being looked at but obviously our prosecutors are going to look to see all the laws that have been violated and if the evidence is there theyre going to prosecute those violations
650448 an outgrowth of the fitzgerald investigation is that the gloves are off in leak cases
650449 if the program is as sensitive and critical as it has been described and leaking its existence could put the lives of innocent american people in jeopardy
650450 that surely would have an effect on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion
650451 persons who have unauthorized possession who come into unauthorized possession of classified information must abide by the law
650452 and through my earphones i could hear on our transatlantic feedback the smooth voice of bob trout announcing the broadcast from our new york studio our part went off all right i think new york said on the feedback afterwards that it was a success they want another one tonight
650453 you burned the city of london in our houses and we felt the flames that burned it
650454 one disappointing thing about the job though murrow and i are not supposed to do any talking on the radio ourselves
650455 greece is in the grip of politicians who are amazingly unwilling to serve anybody except themselves
650456 if the weight of the public testimony has tended to show that so far senator mccarthys charges are unproven that is not my responsibility
650457 the actions of the junior senator from wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable comfort to our enemies
650458 who has served his country better senator mccarthy or i
650459 ive spent a good portion of my life trying to give back to outward bound something it gave to me
650460 he was uncertain as many of us are growing up can we handle ourselves in adversity he had been bounced around he sort of found a center in this
650461 i said to myself it sure seems odd for the publisher of the new york times
650462 you get a bad king every once in a while
650463 its just a matter of time until we start losing money
650464 orgies of self absorption that distract us from our more important work
650465 the single most unsettling thing people face now is the economic situation confronting the paper and not knowing what the future holds
650466 i really think the financial issue faced by this company and this industry is the big concern and not judith miller
650467 and before you answer that question just so everybody knows
650468 its pretty loud in this room so my apologies the bomb sniffing dog threw up here
650469 have you seen judy miller lately perhaps president bush can help with that one
650470 he was the charming young father who brought his baby boy to a party on his shoulders he made a real effort to be one of the boys
650471 punch has a dry sense of humor ironic sardonic arthurs humor is very different hes a little quick with the gun
650472 when he came in gays in the newsroom lived in terror and arthur met them and took each of them to lunch and said what is it like to be gay here
650473 that was the day you said this guy is tone deaf
650474 on the business side there is a tendency to suspect that the newsroom is hiding something behind a lot of smoke and mirrors this is a perception howell fed of all the things howell bequeathed to me somewhere high on that list maybe higher than judy miller is his claim that the newsroom had become fat and complacent that plays into what business sides of newspapers tend to believe i think that was wrong i think the reason he made that case was cynical i dont think he really believed it i think he thought it would make him popular with the business side
650475 howell campaigned for the job with the political skills we admire in karl rove
650476 it was well known throughout the paper that i believed the times needed to improve its journalism and its business practices it still does witness the declining stock price any reasonable person who read my editorial page could see that i did not pander to business or economic interests inside or outside the paper bill knows that the cynicism if any ran the other way joe lelyveld tried to cast me as a candidate of the business side in hopes of improving bills standing in the newsroom my own view is that an editor in todays environment who doesnt understand the economics of the newspaper business is under informed
650477 i dont want to get involved in old new york times debates
650478 has this habit of telling recruits theres something in the new york water that makes your penis fall off
650479 hes a bit of a loner he spends a lot of time in his office
650480 we started out without much of a relationship at all and with a certain wariness of each other
650481 a question of whether arthur and i like each other i think we do
650482 we need people to understand what this means we need passion
650483 he wanted to do the right thing but he seemed na ve
650484 when we consider the many complex issues that we face at home and abroad it is hard to imagine a more inopportune moment to restrain our access to information when individuals do speak to us confidentially they do so knowing we will protect their identity
650485 was defensive unrelentingly sure of her positions and unwilling to be perceived as someone who wrote bad stories
650486 i should have left the paper after the editors note
650487 the reason i didnt is that weeks afterward i got a subpoena i knew i couldnt fight on my own
650488 he was one of the most famous products of ahmad chalabis intelligence factory
650489 someone who had specifically been a source in one of judys discredited w m d stories
650490 she was calling me up to say im at haideris house theyre going to deport him im the only one who can report this story it was just unmistakable that she saw her role here as partly the author of a great scoop but also someone who was way too invested in her sources
650491 a guy who lives and dies on anonymous sources and who i could not see doing something to ruin his credibility with people who tell him stuff that gave me pause but i breezed past it
650492 at that point i should have gone into the room and said listen guys the lawyers arent very optimistic there is even some potential danger that the supreme court would seize on this case for an opportunity to make things even worse
650493 i dont know what advice he got from his lawyers but he was very gung ho
650494 when i raised issues shouldnt we check on the waiver thing
650495 that is on whether libby genuinely had no objection to millers revealing her source
650496 how could the times have embarked on this venture without knowing all of the facts
650497 the first time i met judy on this case the first thing she said was somebody has to fight back against fitzgerald
650498 im not trying to escape responsibility but judy was a very active client it seems to me that if you dont continually ask what is the principle youre trying to establish there is nothing left to defend
650499 reach out to fitzgerald to see if he would narrow his scope to one source
650500 we feared fitzgerald wanted my entire notebook and all my sources
650501 the decision was that she was not going to work with words again
650502 were all in agreement that she could never again be a reporter for the times and that the best course would be that she should leave the paper
650503 put her in a job where she would be genuinely contained
650504 she kept kind of drifting on her own back into the national security realm
650505 putting the defense of the reporter above the duty to its readers
650506 if i had known the details of judys entanglement with libby id have been more careful in how the paper articulated its defense
650507 institution most in danger would be the newspaper in your hands
650508 i did not know of maureens column on judy before it ran
650509 arthur told her she was not coming back as a reporter
650510 sulzbergers jabber differs not one whit from the standard bullshit move along folks theres nothing here to see issued by every politician and corporate leader who finds himself trapped in the medias crosshairs
650511 lets go back to why judy went to jail because this has become so intertwined and it almost makes her time of eighty five days in jail seem as though it was a sideshow when it was the main ring
650512 i dont know what the list of alleged journalistic shortcomings are because the ones the times listed have now all been shown to have been bogus or the result of spite envy by former colleagues
650513 raised the bar and will make government think before putting a journalist in jail i hope i will be known as a reporter who helped get a federal shield law i fear that the times betrayal of me may have weakened that
650514 it could be an ugly spectacle and not something that will be uplifting or help the credibility of the news profession
650515 this case is a no win situation for the press the only question is how to do the least harm
650516 sometimes we have to force the courts to rule only a willingness to fight when necessary makes possible some sort of victory in the courts or some sort of protection from congress
650517 we stood up for a value that is core to this company
650518 i did not embrace this it was given to us i just chose not to walk away from it i didnt feel the need for a pentagon papers case
650519 my job is simple my job is to work with janet robinson and bill keller and all of our colleagues and turn this great company this institution into something that will flourish in a digital age im going to be judged on that im not going to be judged on this story or that
650520 more and more its looking like the biggest problem at the times is not a judy miller an arthur sulzberger problem
650521 learn to see things in grays as they get older
650522 thats a part of my personality and sometimes i control it better than at other times
650523 this is a tough job and part of my defense and part of me is that i have a sense of humor that probably explains my motorcycle sometimes it comes out in ways where i should show more seriousness but i enjoy life and fun during difficult times a sense of humor is an important valve
650524 there were one or two days he said i cant come tomorrow
650525 sulzberger has reason to feel that critics have overlooked the principled stand he took on behalf of the newsroom and also the investment he continues to make in order to produce what arguably remains the worlds finest newspaper
650526 the most important thing he is doing to position the times for the future is developing nytimes
650527 this decision was made with great reluctance and sadness and little choice if the post did not sell the times said it would start its own international edition anyway
650528 with the joint ownership it had no one was going to take the steps necessary
650529 we had basically signed away our rights in perpetuity we found a window to get out of it and we jumped through it could you imagine us not owning our morgue
650530 about was a hidden gem that people were not focussed on
650531 arthur and i for obvious reasons can be direct without concern that someone will not like what we say and there will be ramifications for our careers using that constructively is valuable for the company
650532 the virtue of a family owned company is that it takes the long view the risk is that there is no discipline to force them to operate efficiently family ownership can spur risk taking as it did when rupert murdochs news corp invested in satellite television in china or fox news entrepreneurs take risks the disadvantage comes when you have all that security and not the same drive arthur to his credit cares deeply about the journalism but he lacks passion for the business side
650533 we are a company committed to journalism that is our core strength that is our hedgehog we are not in the education or cooking business you are going to see us make journalism investments and i include about com as journalism about is about information
650534 in and of itself an investment in a cable station if that was our only reason for doing this would not be overarchingly compelling it may be a business to have but it wouldnt be strategic
650535 no one watches it and no one will watch it very few on the business side liked the deal it was all arthur
650536 i think im surrounded by incredibly smart people who get the newsroom
650537 janet in fact is a remarkable conduit for information from the newsroom for me i take nothing away from my father and his wonderful tenure as publisher and chairman of this company but ive got to find my own management style its a different work environment requiring less command and control much more bottom up
650538 one of the things arthur gets great credit for internally is the fact that hes extremely inclusive in regard to asking opinions from a variety of sources if he only had one source if it was only me or our general counsel or bill keller it wouldnt be arthur arthur does his homework and seeks out other views
650539 seeks opinions but because of janet robinsons style he doesnt get any
650540 smart enough to know what he is good at and what he is not good at
650541 very good at creating a collegial environment among the top people at the times he knows that he didnt grow up in the business world and punch knew the same thing they both got very good people to lead the business effort

650567 tidak satu pun hadits yang menerangkan tentang keutamaan bulan rajab adalah benar shahih tidak tentang keutamaan berpuasa seluruhnya dan tidak pula sebagiannya atau shalat pada malam malam tertentu padanya dan al imam abu ismail al harawi al hafidz sudah pernah mengatakan hal ini sebelum saya kami meriwayatkan hal ini darinya dengan sanad yang shahih begitu pula dari selain beliau

650716 wir haben das lenkrad gewechselt und das system neugestartet ohne erfolg das war richtig bitter denn heute w re viel m glich gewesen bruno ist auf das podium gefahren und in der startaufstelllung stand er hinter mir
650717 bei noch zehn zu fahrenden runden hat der ldruck immer mehr nachgelassen ich habe versucht anzukommen denn ich war in einer guten position
650718 ich war viel schneller und h tte heute vierter werden k nnen aber ich durfte giorgio nicht berholen
650719 ich verstehe es einfach nicht ich zahle f r mein cockpit und er bekommt geld aber ich darf ihn nicht berholen ich h tte mir sogar noch yamamoto schnappen k nnen
650720 ich habe absolut kein problem mit giorgio denn er ist ein toller mensch
650721 ich bin einfach nicht gut weggekommen und wurde in der ersten kurve eingeklemmt da waren direkt drei pl tze weg

650734 while the present situation may continue for next two three months the manufacturing industry would be able to revive and achieve higher growth during the terminal period of the financial year 2008 09 provided the government takes some pro active reform measures to redress the genuine grievances of the manufacturing industry
650735 while the farm loan waiver scheme and the proposed salary hikes of government employees will help generate more demand for manufactured items there is need for stimulating consumption reducing interest rates and no further cuts in custom duty on manufactured goods

650765 i think lewis book is peerless and foolish would be the author who tried to replace him however the issues in the public discourse around christianity have become much more complex than they were in the mid and late 20th century the questions are now not just philosophical e g is there evidence for gods existence they are also now cultural doesnt strong faith make a multicultural society impossible political doesnt orthodox religion undermine freedom and personal when c s lewis was writing there was general agreement that rational argument and empirical method were the best ways to discover truth that consensus has vanished
650766 nobody but tim keller could have written this book it seems likely to me that nobody but tim keller will agree with everything he says for example many believers will be uncomfortable with his defence of evolution not the naturalistic evolution of so many sceptics but a theistic evolution that attempts to reconcile rather than ignore the creation accounts of the bible others will take issue with his description of hell and the thread of ecumenism that runs throughout the volume but if we heed his exhortation to major on the majors to look to whats most foundational to the faith before focusing on matters of secondary importance both believers and sceptics have a great deal to learn from this book

650900 esta cifra es casi un 40 por ciento m s alta que las anteriores estimaciones del cdc de 40 000 infecciones por a o que estaban basadas en informaciones m s limitadas y m todos menos precisos
650901 los datos confirman que hay un fuerte impacto de esta epidemia entre los hombres gays y bisexuales de estados unidos as como entre los hombres y mujeres negros

650906 tememos igualmente que adem s de la retribuci n de servicios que pueda hacerse a trav s de la asignaci n de contratos por parte del gobierno de canarias se pretende obtener el control de facto del medio p blico teniendo una adjudicataria agradecida que a sabiendas de las m ltiples infracciones cometidas se mostrar d cil y maleable ante el temor continuo de la resoluci n del contrato en cualquier momento

650909 its a very tough line to walk between being a journalist and being politicized shell have to be above reproach in matters concerning her husband for my money it would be best that she never even mentions that she had a husband if i were looking for an ideal situation id want a reader a year from now to be shocked an amazed that she was married to a u s senator
650910 michelle obama is indeed auditioning for first lady and a lot of voters dont know much about her beyond media controversies
650911 like most mothers michelle obama relishes the daily mess of life as a parent she also struggles with the maternal guilt so typical of working mothers
650912 theres another reason i wanted to talk to michelle obama and its personal like her i am the wife of a u s senator in many ways she and i head dramatically different lives but both of us are mothers and career women who know what it feels like to put our own lives on hold to support politically ambitious husbands weve lost count of the times weve been introduced as the lovely wife and we know there are always some campaign veterans who consider women like us either a prop or a problems in their husbands races so we had plenty to talk about

650918 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
650919 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
650920 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
650921 it would have been a difficult situation because you cant know how the sheep is going to behave in those circumstances and obviously it took the wrong course of action

650937 podemos hacer historia en lautaro existen all cerca de 300 comunidades y los avances que hemos logrado como partido nos tienen optimistas sabemos que tenemos que trabajar duro y el mandato que la gente a entregado a luis es competir para ganar

650941 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo

650944 las familias de campo sufren cada d a m s intentos de desalojos detenciones y criminalizaci n con o sin retenciones la represi n seguir las fumigaciones que nos envenenan estar n a la orden del d a y seguiremos en la lucha porque no hay ninguna intenci n de desarmar el modelo de agronegocios ni distribuci n de tierras ni cuestionamientos al actual uso de la tierra la discusi n es entre empresarios del campo y politiqueros de doble discurso
650945 se trata de un conflicto por dinero y poder ni siquiera hay una discusi n ideol gica todos ellos entienden la tierra como una mercanc a y pelean por ver qui n se queda con la mayor parte las cuatro entidades son totalmente opuestas a nuestra ideolog a con un trasfondo hist rico que a n no est saldado donde hubo usurpaci n y desaparici n de una gran parte de nuestro pueblo no nos olvidamos de ese crimen
650946 el gobierno no tiene una pol tica real para cambiar la realidad de los m s necesitados y mucho menos para los pueblos ind genas
650947 fueron masacradas en las mismas tierras que hoy son utilizadas para el monocultivo de soja
650948 el actual tipo de cambio el boom de la soja y las forestales desplazaron a la ganader a desde el litoral y la pampa hacia esta provincia las empresas donde tambi n est n las mineras intentan por todos los medios apropiarse de tierras y agua comprando fraguando t tulos usurpando y prometiendo un progreso que son mentiras
650949 reforma agraria integral y soberan a alimentaria que es la posibilidad de que el pa s tenga su propio proyecto alimentario y no que las multinacionales impongan qu se debe producir
650950 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales
650951 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
650952 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno
650953 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
650954 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo
650955 esas cuatro patronales no nos representan pero tampoco el gobierno que nos ha fallado nos abandon
650956 no tenemos ninguna confirmaci n oficial sobre la llegada de alg n ministro o si nos van a llamar para entrevistarnos con el gobernador en la capital de la provincia por lo que nosotros nos mantenemos firmes en esa ocupaci n pac fica que es una reivindicaci n territorial
650957 venimos a reivindicar nuestro derecho territorial con un acto de ocupaci n pac fica pero las medidas de acci n directa se ir n incrementando si la provincia no acusa recibo
650958 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
650959 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n
650960 las provincias son libres para crear las instancias judiciales que estimen apropiadas pero no pueden vedar a ninguna de ellas y menos a las m s altas la aplicaci n preferente de la constituci n nacional

651008 el actual tipo de cambio el boom de la soja y las forestales desplazaron a la ganader a desde el litoral y la pampa hacia esta provincia las empresas donde tambi n est n las mineras intentan por todos los medios apropiarse de tierras y agua comprando fraguando t tulos usurpando y prometiendo un progreso que son mentiras
651009 reforma agraria integral y soberan a alimentaria que es la posibilidad de que el pa s tenga su propio proyecto alimentario y no que las multinacionales impongan qu se debe producir
651010 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales

651043 the neuroscientists idea of a game is rock paper scissors which is zero sum whereas economists have focused on strategic games that produce gains through collaboration
651044 from moment to moment the hedonimeter varies the delicate index now flickering with the flutter of the passions now steadied by intellectual activity low sunk whole hours in the neighbourhood of zero or momentarily springing up towards infinity
651045 economics became a deductive science because we didnt have the tools to gather information inductively now better statistical tools and neuroscience are opening up the possibility that economics can become an abductive science that combines elements of deductive and inductive reasoning
651046 curiosity about neuroscience among economists has outstripped what we have to say for now
651047 blood flow is an indirect measure of what goes on in the head a blunt instrument
651048 in many areas of economics it will dominate because it works
651049 we are nowhere near the demise of traditional neoclassical economics
651050 these traditional economists may be more impressed by brain evidence than evidence from psychology
651051 when you talk about biology either in an evolutionary or physical sense you feel they have greater comfort levels than when you start to talk about psychology
651052 it is far easier to argue for mindless economics than for brainless economics

651058 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
651059 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

651061 then i looked and i heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels numbering myriads of myriads and thousands and thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessings and i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them saying to him who sits on the throne and to the lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever and the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshipped

651087 if i have the opportunity im going to ask him where exactly does he now stand on this
651088 senator obama understands how important nasas mission is to our countrys scientific edge and to our economy and that is why he is committed to identifying a means to fully fund his education program while also ensuring nasa has a balanced and adequately funded mission
651089 while my opponent seems content to retreating from american exploration of space for a decade i am not
651090 as president i will act to make ensure our astronauts will continue to explore space and not just by hitching a ride with someone else
651091 i intend to make sure that the nasa constellation program has the resources it needs so that we can begin a new era of human space exploration
651092 i believe we need to revitalize nasas mission to maintain americas leadership and recommit our nation to the space program and as president i intend to do just that
651093 have spoken a number of times on various issues including the importance of the nations space program and obama certainly understands the need for america to retain its position as world leader in science and technology
651094 demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding regarding the importance of nasa
651095 floridas space coast is already facing tremendous challenges as the shuttle program comes to a close and cutting funding for constellation would do great harm to the project and the region
651096 its critical that constellation move forward as quickly as possible so we can shrink the pending gap in u s manned spaceflight
651097 we dont want to see a delay of the constellation program
651098 if i get the chance ill ask him about it and certainly admonish him not
651099 i know its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program
651100 i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money thats going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there
651101 delaying the nasa constellation program for five years using purchase cards and the negotiating power of the government to reduce costs of standardized procurement auctioning surplus federal property and reducing the erroneous payments identified by the government accountability office and closing the ceo pay deductibility loophole
651102 barack obamas early education and k 12 plan package costs about 18 billion per year you will pay for this plan without increasing the deficit with a portion of the savings from your plan to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending this includes reforming and reducing earmark spending reforming federal contracting procedures using purchase cards and the negotiating power of the government to reduce costs of standardized procurement auctioning surplus federal property and reducing the erroneous payments identified by the government accountability office and closing the ceo pay deductibility loophole
651103 today in florida barack obama once again demonstrated that his words really dont matter
651104 when discussing nasa programs barack obama said that its still being reported that he would delay the nasa constellation program to pay for his early education program unfortunately for barack obama that is what he proposed and has been saying for months
651105 despite his pandering today barack obamas proposals to postpone scientific exploration and cut funding for nasa simply highlight his inexperience with regards to space policy unlike obama john mccain will ensure that our astronauts have the resources needed to begin a new era of space exploration
651106 once again john mccain and his campaign have decided to take the low road rather than defend his own record on nasa issues
651107 not only has mccain voted to take funding from nasa to fund other priorities but his fantasy plan to pay for making the bushs tax cuts permanent by freezing discretionary funding and vetoing every bill with earmarks would cost the mars mission millions

651141 i am very impressed with the pinotage wines we judged most of the wines show a classic balance of fruit and wood treatment as well as a good combination of complexity and elegance
651142 there are many rich full bodied wines that are also accessible these pinotage wines show a red cultivar with personality and distinctive characteristics it can be compared with the highest quality wines of all the international wine cultivars i have been tasting south african wines for quite a while now and pinotage is showing more constant quality year after year
651143 it seems as if the 2006 and 2007 vintages delivered most of the top wines with excellent balance and versatility wines that will complement various dishes these are not blockbuster wines and most of them can compete internationally

651160 es que cada vez que me dispongo a hacer alguna tonter a aqu debido a la a oranza de la familia o a la culpa que siento por los errores cometidos el carcelero llama en la reja y me dice ha llegado carta de denir
651161 noto el cuerpo pesado hormigueando observo en mis pacientes que esas reacciones f sicas son siempre indicadoras de una presencia espiritual obsesora principalmente cuando vienen acompa adas de fuertes escalofr os me siento paralizada siento mi cuerpo pero no consigo moverme es com n en el comienzo de la sesi n de regresi n que el esp ritu obsesor inmovilice al paciente para dominarlo

651165 me gustar a que l me perdonase la paciente llora hoy jam s har a semejante cosa con qui n quiera que fuese intuyo que l sabe que he cambiado pero no logra perdonarme
651166 dice que s pues sabe que la soledad me hace sufrir y principalmente alejando a los hombres de m dice que me perjudica tambi n sexualmente no permitiendo que me realice como mujer
651167 veo a un hombre con una t nica blanca est fluctuando delante de m es mi mentor espiritual la paciente llora

651174 israels main purpose is to create a barrier between syria and iran and if this is achieved the return of the golan heights to syria would be a worthwhile price
651175 he knows that being stuck between the iranian leader mahmoud ahmadinejad and the hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah can only harm syria he wants to be part of the west he wants syria to be no longer included in the axis of evil and taken off the american list of countries that support terrorism israel should seize this opportunity with both hands
651176 they have discovered water on mars for the third or fourth time
651177 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
651178 there is nothing on the record to indicate obama ever withdrew his support from odinga
651179 even after odinga signed the agreement with the muslims in kenya
651180 appears even today to be a direct and active supporter of odinga as odinga himself frequently boasts
651181 something obama has done almost every day since he arrived in kenya last week
651182 i think odinga has to look at critically where he is receiving his advice from just because somebody wants to run for president and he is using senator obama as his stooge as his puppet to be able to get where he wants to get
651183 for their own separate reasons odinga and sheik abdullah abdi joined forces
651184 sheik abdullah abdi agreed to swing islamic voters to odinga in kenya and odinga agreed to support islam should he become president
651185 by endorsing raila odinga during his 2006 visit to kenya obama positioned himself to be seen by kenyans as an important u s senator who was joining forces with his luo tribal kinsman this positioning further sided obama with raila odinga as he ran against president mwai kibaki in the december 2007 presidential election in kenya
651186 do you know you have eternal life will you go to heaven when you die you say i dont know lets resolve that now
651187 please take comfort and know that god was there my wife and i were traveling on the 91 freeway and we started praying there were christians all around your son praying for him god was there
651188 your son who is so special to god that he sent his people to care for him
651189 i have a task to do and i want to do it
651190 its usually a pretty full event but i imagine this year it will be even more full if such a thing is possible
651191 people are going to want to come and hear what he says
651192 i think theres a resonance there that hell be able to tap into between his recent family experience and evangelical theology
651193 death is not a time of memories only its a time of questions questions about life questions about death questions about life after death
651194 i dont think theres anything more that we could do that would honor christopher and honor god by making sure people know theres an opportunity to hear the gospel
651195 i was hoping for an influx of people once we announced this and were still hopeful people will take advantage of this program before the summer is over
651196 its really the only thing homeowners can do to protect from a disaster it gives the fire district a leg up if you have good defensible space at your home and buys them some time to protect your home
651197 it did help we had about 16 trees taken down and that was quite expensive so the rebate was a really big influence on our decision
651198 were very thankful to have our home and want to protect it we have about 80 trees on our property and just wanted to thin it out to make things a little healthier
651199 were hoping we can be a big influence to others on how to stay safe we want to be a good example
651200 the high tea that awaited them was truly magnificent a huge ham a salad fit for a king including lettuce tomatoes onions radishes mustard and cress carrots and lashings of hard boiled eggs
651201 it was a most peculiar breakfast but the four children thought it was lovely they had three loaves of bread with them and some butter and they dabbed the butter on to the chunks took the eggs in their hand and bit first at the egg and then at the bread jill put a paper of salt down on the deck for them to dip the eggs into
651202 i am running for president against senators obama and mccain primarily because they have consistently failed to address issues that affect the 2 million children in the united states who are abused neglected exploited abandoned homeless and institutionalized through no fault of their own
651203 ironically were experiencing record registration but were expecting low turnout for the primary
651204 voters need to remember that the primary and general elections are inherently connected and that the results of the primaries determine their choices in the general election in november
651205 it is really important to get some kind of exhibit to show people residents visitors and kids so that they can get a sense of our history
651206 we started looking into the possibility of having our own historical society at the end of 2005
651207 people move to new places and it is important to help them understand the history of the area they have moved to
651208 i wonder how many residents know that sand harbor used to be a mill
651209 it does not include a lot of artifacts but we wanted it to look like you are stepping into a different time and place
651210 realtors understand that good schools are an integral part of neighborhoods
651211 we as a community have an obligation to make sure that the children in our schools are provided with a learning environment that will enable the best possible education for students while ensuring a safe warm and dry classroom
651212 no child in washoe county should be subjected to a poor learning environment and thats why the realtors feel it is important to give back to the community in this way
651213 im going to buy a half interest in your lot
651214 the key thing is what you put into it is what you get out of it
651215 one of the things in the new york schools that i really liked was that they taught foreign languages in the elementary schools i took french and just loved it
651216 i was the only one in my family that lettered
651217 i taught in woodland for six years and i loved it
651218 my first year i had a wonderful classroom aide she was very sweet maybe in her early 50s
651219 the children love you love school and you get very sweet little notes from them
651220 one of the things i really love about working with children is that teachers are so sharing of ideas supplies and take you under their wing
651221 so i felt if my young child could look at it this way so can i
651222 we just thought we would be here for one year
651223 i love doing this working with the children in a school environment and not having the responsibility of teaching
651224 a key goal of this project is to assist these individuals to successfully navigate the juvenile justice system and achieve stability within the community setting
651225 is they took the concept of sanctuary and they applied it in a way that it is as close to harboring as ive ever seen
651226 then they accommodate them by providing all these services to continue their unlawful status
651227 the city in this case is using taxpayer dollars to basically endear itself to activist groups that need funding for their activities
651228 dont give them guns dont give them tractors dont give them jobs
651229 the enemy is raising his head with brazenness with verbal and physical violence and with offensiveness to jewish girls the enemy is making inroads into our neighborhoods and cities and we are giving them jobs
651230 it has again become clear that cheap arab labor actually costs a very dear price in blood the murderous tractors driven by arabs of eastern jerusalem are just the tip of the iceberg of a national problem that has long become an existential danger
651231 a proper jewish leadership would act with full force to deter terrorists their dispatchers and their supporters as well as to expel enemies and take all measures to end the bloodshed in the holy land
651232 but even now without a proper jewish leadership we must act on the individual level to stop supporting the arab enemy each and every one must take at least one corrective step of teshuvah repentance to strengthen jewish labor and not to support the enemies of israel
651233 as a first practical step we call for an end to hiring enemies to work in our houses an end to purchasing from enemies and not to directly employ enemies
651234 ive put my heart and soul into the job but my head is telling me to pack it in
651235 hopefully this will make my last few years an exciting time i wont be at the oval i need a few weeks away from the game
651236 theres going to be plenty of enthusiasm getting over there and that is one thing thats certainly very important in these big games
651237 when you have a loss like this it just about guarantees that youre going to have pretty good performance when the team next goes onto the field
651238 whilst the guys are all going to hurt for the next couple of weeks until we play the next game the next performance will be a big one from us im sure
651239 i think we put too pressure on ourselves in not executing things well right across from the lineout to the breakdown as well
651240 when they the all blacks come with that sort of intensity and we make those sorts of mistakes then it puts them on the front foot and its very hard to recover from that
651241 ha dejado detr s de l a una generaci n de expertos a los que ha dado entrenamiento y ense anza
651242 los pistoleros abrieron fuego en territorio israel y nuestros soldados rescataron a los miembros del clan del ataque de las milicias de ham s a las que disparamos para mantenerles alejados
651243 minha decis o foi bastante clara jamais pensei em fazer isso
651244 inflationary pressures continue to prevent the mpc from cutting rates in response to the deteriorating real economy
651245 in fact if interest rates change this month they are more likely to go up than down
651246 repealed as of the date of enactment of this act
651247 last week tim walberg received another check from big oil it happened to be a 1 000 thank you check from exxon mobils political action committee
651248 mark schauer flat out lied to the public about receiving campaign contributions from the oil industry
651249 although he has accepted tens of thousands of dollars in the past he has the audacity to criticize his opponent for receiving far less schauers hypocrisy and dishonesty on this issue should raise serious questions for south central michigan voters as to what kind of congressman schauer would be
651250 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
651251 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
651252 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
651253 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
651254 well tom i hope youre satisfied for helping us lose the election
651255 tout ce qui ne nous tue pas nous rend plus fort
651256 it seems like he gets to a certain point and doesnt finish the pitch
651257 i think i could pitch up there with the tigers right now if i wanted 7 days ago
651258 as soon as he came on he got us playing you never lose that ability he created a few chances and forced a brilliant save out of their goalkeeper
651259 i have had the best players in the world around me
651260 i am more optimistic as time goes on my crystal ball is unfortunately not working very well so ill wait and see where we are but as things positively progress thats good news
651261 its her arrival in macau on monday conformation for me that shes making good progress
651262 its a team effort there are a lot of people involved in this coaches medics
651263 getting into the champions league is not going to be easy
651264 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
651265 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen
651266 esta a hora de se reivindicar sal rios aumentos de conquistas e mais direitos trabalhistas
651267 o momento em que voc os trabalhadores deve conquistar sal rios
651268 estou falando quase como presidente do sindicato mas assim mesmo
651269 eles estavam no cassino nos estados unidos e agora pularam para o mercado especulativo futuro do petr leo e dos alimentos a veio a infla o mundial
651270 at aquele nordestino deixe de plantar macaxeira e tenha m quinas para alimentar o brasil e o mundo
651271 we are extremely proud of the many heroic and brave achievements of our son and brother gerard
651272 the last few days have been a roller coaster of emotions as we celebrated with joy hs historic achievment and now we must try to come to terms with the untimely loss of a great son brother and friend
651273 it is total and utter shock and every time a friend passes away like this it is just numbing
651274 pensamos que alrededor de 68 personas han muerto y que muchos resultaron heridos
651275 hab a mucha gente adentro y est bamos tratando de pelear por espacio cuando todo el mundo comenz a caerse
651276 deber a ser aut rquico o depender de la presidenta
651277 moreno no tendr a que estar en el indec este organismo no tendr a que depender de nadie deber a ser aut rquico o depender de la presidenta
651278 una reuni n con gente de algunos partidos no es la concertaci n plural sino que es ponernos de acuerdo en cada tema tenemos opiniones distintas porque provenimos de espacios distintos la concertaci n plural es un espacio de participaci n no de adhesi n a lo que dice el partido justicialista
651279 que sacara a moreno le dije que el indec debe recuperar la credibilidad que debe tener todo organismo
651280 a algunos se le ocurri a ltimo momento sugerirme la idea de no ir al recinto a votar pero hubiera sido la peor decisi n de mi vida yo no le escapo el bulto a las cosas me tendr an que haber secuestrado en serio c mo explico el hecho de no bajar
651281 cobos no va a hacer una locura cobos puede desempatar en el senado pero no hacer locuras
651282 volver a a hacer cada una de las cosas que hice
651283 estamos saldando una deuda no s lo con la argentina sino con la forma de vivir y actuar como seres humanos
651284 nunca se vio desde el retorno de la democracia un nivel de violencia de lock out patronal con cortes de rutas y la afectaci n de otras actividades econ micas la violencia no fue por parte del gobierno sino por sectores que provocaron la suspensi n entera de turnos de f brica la suba de precios por falta de mercader a y escenas de pugilato
651285 la discusi n no tiene que ver con que estemos unidos o desunidos sino con qu modelo econ mico nos vamos a desarrollar la unidad no pasa por la homogeneidad en cuanto a las ideas sino poder debatir un modelo que pueda dar crecimiento y movilidad social ascendente
651286 la lecci n que pude sacar es que fui demasiado ingenua porque no contaba con el poder de sectores que si bien son peque os en n mero son muy fuertes en poder econ mico y creo que deber a haber en todos los sectores de la vida pol tica un gesto de calidad institucional no s lo en el gobierno los sectores que defienden sus propios intereses deber an decirlo a la hora de pedir el voto a la sociedad
651287 muchas veces hemos tratado en estos ltimos a os temas de redistribuci n con la plata del estado con la plata del estado todos son socialistas el tema es ser redistributivo con la renta extra y el problema es el modelo de la concentraci n de la riqueza en un mundo complicado cada vez m s y donde alimentos y energ a requieren de las autoridades y exigen instrumentos para afrontar esa realidad
651288 cuando uno toma una decisi n pol tica eval a las consecuencias positivas o negativas no me corresponde adjetivar la decisi n del vicepresidente hay que desdramatizar los roles de la presidenta y del vicepresidente est n perfectamente delimitados por la constituci n
651289 volver a a impulsar la resoluci n 125 porque por primera vez las instituciones de la democracia nos hemos puesto a discutir una ley que tocaba la redistribuci n del ingreso en la argentina
651290 dios m o creo que un secretario de comercio no define cambios per se por qu hay que satanizar a los funcionarios en todo caso me parece demasiado reduccionista el criterio de responsabilizar a un funcionario a los funcionarios hay que juzgarlos por su gesti n de acuerdo con las instrucciones que emanan de la presidenta
651291 el tema fue manejado pol tica y medi ticamente no s lo en la argentina se presentan dudas sucede en todas las sociedades y en todas las econom as en los pa ses vecinos donde los salarios son menores a los de la argentina se registran precios de alimentos mayores y la inflaci n sin embargo da menos que en nuestro pa s me ha tocado ver cr ticas a otros ndices en otras partes del mundo y por ejemplo en estados unidos no se tiene en cuenta el precio de los combustibles
651292 la descentralizaci n y el env o de recursos ha sido formidable desde 2003 hasta la fecha en la p gina web del ministerio de econom a se puede ver que el incremento de fondos enviados a las provincias desde 2003 fue geom trico y no producto de la generosidad del gobierno del ex presidente n stor kirchner sino porque la recaudaci n creci en forma exponencial
651293 hay una participaci n plena en el sistema de contralor del gobierno y hemos avanzado mucho con la aplicaci n de la constituci n nacional la auditoria general la sindicatura general la comisi n revisora de cuentas el parlamento y ustedes los periodistas
651294 es un tema superado con la modificaci n de la legislaci n y adem s nunca he firmado un decreto de necesidad y urgencia a pesar de que son instrumentos avalados desde 1994 por la constituci n nacional
651295 en 2003 n stor kirchner era desconocido en buenos aires y dec an que la verdadera presidenta iba a ser yo ahora hay una inversi n y la que es d bil y pusil nime soy yo no es cierto ninguna de las dos historias la convivencia pol tica es m s simple de lo que parece menos tortuosa y complicada de lo que dicen
651296 s lo he renunciado tres veces en mi vida para ascender pol ticamente
651297 tenemos encuestas diferentes a la consultora poliarqu a diferentes a las publicadas por el diario la naci n que tiene una l nea editorial muy cr tica a esta gesti n y a la anterior aunque no quiero polemizar
651298 cuando se dec a del hallazgo de una valija con u s 800 000 para financiar mi campa a electoral respond a los emisarios de estados unidos sobre lo que cre a recuerdo los titulares que hablaban de 800 000 d lares para la campa a presidencial y respond a ee uu
651299 hoy la relaci n con estados unidos es como siempre normal y seria como debe ser con todos los pa ses del mundo debo confesarle que nunca segu una campa a electoral con el inter s como la que va a ser ahora que por ejemplo hoy sea candidato a presidente un hombre de color como el senador obama alguien que me ha sorprendido por su personalidad su discurso su forma de enfocar las cosas revela un pa s donde alguien pod a ser asesinado 40 o 50 a os atr s por ser de la comunidad de color
651300 la argentina es un gran lugar para inversiones por ser altamente competitiva y u s 13 000 millones corresponden a capitales extranjeros no hay un tipo de cambio presidencial sino que estamos ante un r gimen de administraci n por parte del banco central con autonom a que ha permitido acumulaci n de reservas y solidez al sistema financiero
651301 los partidos de los domingos son sagrados si no voy no logro desenchufarme del trabajo
651302 no puedo descansar si no est todo en orden adem s el domingo es el nico momento que tengo para ponerme al d a con las cosas de la casa y con mis hijos
651303 en nuestras sociedades pareciera ser que el hombre genera o dispone de m s tiempo para realizar actividades que lo distiendan como por ejemplo las relacionadas con el contacto con la naturaleza o con la reuni n con sus amigos
651304 mientras los hombres generan sus momentos para desconectarse de las obligaciones a lo largo de su vida las mujeres tienen etapas hasta los 25 a os realizan mucha actividad social despu s se casan y hasta que los hijos se independizan prefieren dedicar el tiempo libre al cuidado de los menores
651305 tengo que dividir mis d as entre el estudio y el trabajo por eso el resto del tiempo tengo que destinarlo al cuidado del hogar
651306 las obligaciones de las mujeres cambiaron mucho en los ltimos tiempos no s si son tan compartidas con los hombres como se dice los roles de mujeres y hombres siguen siendo muy diferenciados
651307 las mujeres siguen conservando una fuerte carga dom stica y los hombres tienen menos exigencias tambi n hay un componente muy importante que depende de la inserci n en el mercado laboral ese es un mbito en el que se sigue privilegiando a los varones y como ellos disfrutan de m s tiempo libre pueden diversificar m s los programas del fin de semana
651308 un hombre es tan grande como los sue os que tiene
651309 me detectaron al c ncer a tiempo previo al diagn stico hab a comenzado a practicar el budismo me volqu a esa pr ctica y a encontrar de nuevo un camino la posibilidad era que me iba a morir con los a os fui armando otra vida m s chiquita m s tranqui nunca permit que me entrara un solo pensamiento negativo
651310 de los verdaderos valores la familia el amor la vida en el sentido bueno y positivo
651311 uno cree que la felicidad es la diversi n pero pasa por un estado de vida que no muchos est n dispuestos a sacrificar en alg n momento la fiesta en el sentido dionis aco debe terminar y pasar a otra cosa mucho m s resistente en el tiempo
651312 la p rdida del laburo por ejemplo te hace pensar que la felicidad est en cosas m s simples menos extremas como una caricia hay que aprender a vivir con la cosa cotidiana es importante tener una pareja que te acompa e y que te gu e
651313 nos creemos infinitos no tenemos la sensaci n de la muerte creemos que vamos a durar siempre al pasado no lo pod s modificar pero los conflictos a nivel pareja amigos con uno mismo pueden replantearse la nica verdad es hoy es hacer lo mejor que puedas al proyecto hay que cumplirlo hoy
651314 los sue os tienen esa capacidad de alentar la vida
651315 los sue os escribi evitan que mi vida sea llana y lenta porque la vuelven vertical y plena de movimientos vivos variados y perseverantes cada vez que encaro la concreci n de un sue o siento que doy el primer paso hacia la realidad de vivir descubriendo nuevas cosas sin caer en rutinas ni pasar un d a igual a otro siempre tengo algo que lograr ello me hace crecer y conquistar una parte de mi que ignoraba me estoy convirtiendo en due o de mis decisiones dirijo lo que hago por d nde quiero y soy el propio y verdadero due o de mi vida
651316 descubro fortalezas que nunca pens tener potencio habilidades que ten a dormidas supero defectos y quiebro l mites creo que inici un gran camino porque encontr la puerta que cada vez que la abro me conecta con dios
651317 experiencia es lo que obtienes cuando no consigues lo que quieres
651318 los obst culos nos dan una chance para demostrar cu nto queremos algo si en verdad ese es tu objetivo si en verdad so s con aquello que parece imposible superar s los pantanos como sea
651319 i think the growth of ashford will strengthen the market to both paris and brussels and other services beyond that
651320 i think in time we can reasonably expect the international services to grow from ashford
651321 we knew that the passenger traffic of eurostar was holding up well
651322 we also knew people had been putting pressure on eurostar for a while and we were beginning to get a sense they were listening to us
651323 in terms of the growth of ashford which will see ashford eventually becoming twice its current size the demand for a direct service to brussels and paris will grow so this decision is very significant
651324 this decision was the right one for the loyal customers who have been using ashford and supporting eurostar for well over 10 years
651325 the passenger campaign to re instate a direct service to brussels was one of the most determined ive seen
651326 the link is essential for regeneration and will increase ashfords ability to attract new business and jobs to the region
651327 although we think the direct ashford brussels service will be loss making initially we are prepared to take a risk and see if it is possible to build up sufficient demand to make it commercially viable
651328 there have been calls for a direct service between ashford and brussels now we hope travellers will show they value it and will use it

651337 as pessoas idosas v o se curvando ao longo dos anos isso ocorre porque as v rtebras que s o quadradas se quebram na parte frente e a coluna vai envergando trata se de fraturas por compress o da coluna que causam o que chamamos de cifose progressiva

651354 my only regret with timothy mcveigh is he did not go to the new york times building
651355 i was going to have a few comments on the other democratic presidential candidate john edwards but it turns out that you have to go into rehab if you use the word faggot so im so kind of at an impasse cant really talk about edwards so i think ill just conclude here and take your questions
651356 faggot isnt offensive to gays it has nothing to do with gays

651361 we have seen the subversion of parliament media and truth we want to bring to the notice of the public the reality behind the cash for vote scandal the victory in the july 22 trust vote has been tainted
651362 we expected the channel to show the sting operation we want the parliamentary committee to probe this
651363 these two mps have submitted a letter along with some documentary evidence that can give leads to the scam and can be used for investigations
651364 the committee should go into these facts and probe the matter
651365 there statements can be corroborated and can be used as independent evidence in the matter
651366 in the face of this subversion we as a political party made an effort to bring out the truth when other institutions were collapsing in front of us
651367 but the question was on what basis this would be done and this became clear on july 22 evening that this was being done by bribery
651368 this is subversion of truth by people in high places it is a big challenge before parliament media and the truth
651369 the parliamentary committee should go into the facts to find out the truth when other institutions are collapsing

651384 preparing for english speaking visitors a restaurant in china recently ran its name through an online translator took the result then purchased and mounted a
651385 people have become more passionate and emotional about the outcome of the election and they want to brand themselves as the type of person who supports xyz
651386 what youre seeing is a mixing of freedom of speech with buying stuff the new trend is to brand yourself as someone who not only supports a side but is really passionate about the issue
651387 that really differentiated us from our competition because they were ranting and raving about political stuff pro america this and america that but everyone was printing on non american made shirts which was highly hypocritical to me
651388 a lot of my customers have come back for that reason alone and have been coming back for the past four years
651389 a lot of other people selling political t shirts were using text that was dumbed down
651390 i really try to shoot for somebody whos a little more knowledgeable about the issues and their subtle nuances
651391 our company is very much geared toward pop culture whats being talked about whats hot and whats going on in the minds of people thats entertaining and newsworthy
651392 the site was created as a way for people who are interested in politics but arent political junkies to weigh in and express themselves in a creative and humorous way

651397 hoje a seguran a jur dica est disponibilizada para uma minoria privilegiada no pa s
651398 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
651399 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
651400 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
651401 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
651402 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
651403 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
651404 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
651405 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
651406 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
651407 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go
651408 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
651409 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
651410 hiphop and books can take out the negative side and stop all the negative views on music nowadays and show a more positive side to the media we should take away all the talks about hoes drugs and alcohol and change it to picking up a book reading and going to school it can help lower drop out rates alot because kids are influenced by what they hear and see in songs and videos so if they hear songs about reading books and getting an education to make good money then they would want to do just that so this project and more positive projects are a great thing for the entertainment industry and the world
651411 most of what we talked about then is now history
651412 we must begin to live within the means of our planet
651413 if you look at the fish a certain way it bears a resemblance to steve rabinowitsh
651414 but the difference is michael jordan was never expected to break a world record every time he competed no athlete in any sport has ever had the pressures and the expectations michael has on him now
651415 the great tiger woods competes and you know what people say about him that he has a good chance to win michael doesnt have that luxury he has to win
651416 i want to be the first michael phelps not the second mark spitz
651417 im just trying to do something thats never been done before
651418 and on the other side of the room ill hear my voice say in that powerbar commercial fear is good all my friends tell me they are sick of seeing me on television frankly i still am not used to it
651419 ive learned how to keep a little more reserve in my tank for when i need it every race i went for it even prelims i dont have to do that
651420 the difference between swimming the 100 butterfly and the 400 individual medley is like the difference between running one mile and running 15 miles
651421 i have been asked by a lot of my friends to get michaels autograph
651422 but im going to keep a few of them for myself
651423 but vandals did hit one building all the way around
651424 its expensive to remove it sure but not as expensive as replacing glass
651425 i will order it if someone comes in and needs it but keeping it stocked its just not worth it etching is the worst type of graffiti
651426 we decided to tackle windows this summer and made a 5 000 purchase order
651427 but we dont know if it will even be enough
651428 we had that dog from the time i was 5 or 6 and he lived a long time until i was in college
651429 i feel i can bring two skills to the board im strong in the marketing and fund raising areas second with experience in publicly traded companies i understand the responsibilities of boards
651430 were not rich people with a fancy facility we put a plank across two barrels for wine tastings were real folks who looked for creative ways to brand our wine
651431 we donate our time and wine to help dogs because really life is too short to be too serious
651432 when we were looking we didnt want a puppy and greyhound rescue was a new idea in new zealand he was being passed over because of his age but he and brenda bonded hes a phenomenal dog as a pet
651433 we really nickel and dime people when they ask us what things cost at this event we say whatve you got

651439 bsirskes verhalten mag legal sein ich halte es aber f r unanst ndig ich fordere ihn auf seinen luxusurlaub sofort abzubrechen und den vorgang sowohl seinen gewerkschaftsmitgliedern als auch den lufthansa aktion ren zu erkl ren
651440 das ist bei gewerkschaftsfunktion ren leider nichts neues diejenigen die den moralischen zeigefinger am h chsten heben halten am ungeniertesten die hand auf
651441 das ist der gipfel der geschmacklosigkeit die kleinen verdi leute stehen mit der fahne vor den toren und k mpfen um einige zehntel mehr w hrend sich ihr gewerkschaftschef wie ein bonze verh lt
651442 wenn er jetzt nicht zur cktritt sollten ihm die gewerkschafter den stuhl vor die t r setzen
651443 estoy muy contento porque pude volver bien que es lo que m s quer a la verdad es que quiero agradecer a todos por el apoyo que me dieron siempre compa eros cuerpo t cnico y al club principalmente

651446 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
651447 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
651448 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
651449 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
651450 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
651451 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
651452 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
651453 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
651454 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
651455 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
651456 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
651457 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors
651458 provide the u s with the infrastructure and freedom of action to project american power regionally as do u s forces in germany japan and south korea
651459 while the unresolved conflict with iraq provides the immediate justification
651460 the need for a substantial american force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of saddam hussein
651461 absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor
651462 the chinese are behind us unmistakably they know it in their words im quoting some of them theyre 25 years behind us
651463 as per our information 30 children and 38 women have been killed
651464 they were asking to enter the state of israel after being threatened by hamas gunmen
651465 the number 2 man in the chambers is the solicitor general therefore he will handle the matter
651466 som inte bara delar ut nobelpris utan ven er vrar nobelpris
651467 in contrast to often dismal diplomacy in other areas bushs handling of china after a rough start has had some sense of nuance and statecraft
651468 it is essential that you unambiguously speak out for human rights and meet with the families of jailed prisoners of conscience while you are in beijing
651469 send a clear signal to the that we respect them
651470 i always had faith in my team we knew we could come back as we have done it in the past there is no doubt there is enough quality in the team
651471 i think 307 was a good total to chase but the loss of early wickets put us under pressure sharma has shown that questions can be asked from batsmen if you bowl in right areas
651472 they india played really good cricket as they knew it was a crucial game for them our bowlers kept us in the game but batting let us down we now need to come back strongly in the final test
651473 it double century was one of my best knocks as it came at the right time
651474 i wanted to bat as long as i can i dont feel pressure when i go in to bat because my captain and coach have always backed me i always like to play my shots
651475 i was very impressed with him he offers us something different
651476 we will have a chat with him and see where we go from here hopefully he will be involved against oxford but thats up to him
651477 he has a tremendous amount of energy and one thing he does is distract defenders
651478 at times accrington were putting two players on him you can see he has ability but he needs to work on his fitness
651479 hes had a chance in the football league so maybe he can see this as a second chance for him and he can rebuild his career with barrow
651480 the do something awards the pre party of the teen choice awards

651482 if you had your wallet taken away from you and you were dropped out of the sky into a strange city with nothing but the shirt on your back what would you do and how long would it take to get financially established
651483 this is an economy where people are on edge about things like downsizing and getting laid off and heres a guy who has wielded that knife
651484 i believe most americans want their next president to remind them of the guy who they work with not the guy who laid them off
651485 you can spin you can jive youre helping the buyout guys
651486 for all of his the positive tension hes gotten for his turnaround accomplishments there is a dark underbelly that feds into a lot of the anger out there in the work force
651487 the likely scenario is that the unions quarterback that line of attack
651488 i was responsible for a firm that invested other peoples money
651489 so id listen to new ideas and try to pick the ones i thought were the most innovative

651531 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments
651532 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women

651543 america is often portrayed as an ignorant unsophisticated sort of place full of bible bashers and ruled to a dangerous extent by trashy television superstition and religious bigotry a place lacking in respect for evidence based knowledge i know that is how it is portrayed because i have done my bit to paint that picture
651544 ive seen them worse but this is pretty good lets get out of here
651545 that dog has done more for me than you could ever ask
651546 japan is a shame sensitive society and the majority of people support the idea of dying gracefully to pay for a crime
651547 is cruel and does not fit with the japanese culture
651548 we were told how to condition pows in a training course before the war even started
651549 but in 100 f heat with a sandbag on your face where your hearts beating like mad because you have been captured it could be conceived as torture which is probably why it was outlawed
651550 so we were told to be wary of the red cross as they might try to poke their noses in where theyre not wanted
651551 it took place in germany before we left for iraq they mentioned conditioning and shock tactics and they definitely said you will bag and tag thats a bag over the prisoners head and you plastic cuff them
651552 it was never ever mentioned to us that hooding was actaually banned i never knew until i left the army
651553 we knew zero tolerance was the only approach or we would be overrun we spread the word that if we saw any criminal activity or anyone carrying a gun we should make arrests
651554 prisoners were to sit in silence facing into the canvas
651555 some were prisoners of war others were criminals from looters to killers as a rule we hooded them on arrest and removed the hoods when they were put in the cage
651556 when his home was raided they discovered shackles designed to fit tiny wrists and ankles
651557 when we removed the sandbag he seemed unfazed then he became agitated babbling about his innocence he lunged at me and i took his feet from under him
651558 the guards picked him up and i told him to stay standing for a while when i came back an hour later he had calmed down i allowed him to sit down
651559 he said sir theres a problem in the cage the prisoner who came in this morning is dead i found him on his back with white foam around his mouth there were dirty marks all over his clothing
651560 he started rolling about on the floor and then he went very quiet he must have had a fit
651561 he took hold of the corpses head and moved it like a ventriloquists dummy
651562 very funny i thought if we hadnt had a serious investigation on our hands two days later four officers from the military polices special investigations branch sib arrived i answered all their questions but they focused on the fact that the prisoner had been sandbagged on arrest i said thats what wed been told to do
651563 he told them hed had a frago an order over the radio from battalion hq saying that was the way we were to deal with them
651564 they had caught a commander and his number two i found one had a broken nose the sas commander said he had gone for a weapon and got whacked with a baton
651565 he said id prefer you to leave us out of your report but i told him no way i didnt want the sib blaming my men for it
651566 he told me a prisoner is dead heard him coughing and then he keeled over
651567 the sib extended their investigation to cover this second death they decided that both were due to natural causes
651568 the comments made by adam ingram that this was not widespread and des brownes statement that it may have happened but only by a small minority is complete horses
651569 we expect our forces to comply fully with international law it is not possible for us to comment further

651614 es sah eigentlich ganz gut aus aber ich habe in der ersten runde einen fehler gemacht ich wollte ein berholman ver auf nelson piquet vorbeireiten und das hat nicht geklappt denn ich habe das auto dabei verloren und anschlie end einige pl tze
651615 dann hing ich hinten im verkehr fest und damit war mein rennen eigentlich schon vorgezeichnet
651616 ich bin nicht besonders gut von der linie weggekommen anders als gestern konnte aber an sakon yamamoto vorbeiziehen als wir in turn zwei hineingefahren sind
651617 dadurch lag ich an position sechs habe mich damit abgefunden und mich aus allen scharm tzeln herausgehalten
651618 ich habe einen platz gutgemacht als lucas di grassi mike conway rausgeboxt hatte und einen weiteren als lucas eine drive through strafe f r sein man ver kassiert hat das berholen auf der strecke ist hier nicht gerade leicht und alleine auf der stra e zu bleiben war schwierig genug denn pastor maldonados auto hat reichlich l auf der piste verteilt
651619 als sein motor schlie lich in die luft ging brauchte ich einige runden um meinem auto wieder vollkommen zu vertrauen der wagen war sehr gut aber ich hatte mich bereits so an das fahren auf dem l gew hnt dass ich nicht ganz sicher war wo sich das limit befand ein bisschen mehr zeit und ich h tte vielleicht noch um den zweiten platz k mpfen k nnen aber das wichtigste war ohnehin gute punkte im hinblick auf die meisterschaft zu sammeln
651620 von einer so harten strecke mit zwei podien heimzukommen ist sehr zufriedenstellend
651621 erst einmal muss ich mich bei javier bedanken denn er hat mich den platz holen lassen obwohl er heute schneller als ich war
651622 nach den ereignissen von gestern haben wir heute das maximum herausgeholt zumal wir von p14 ins rennen gegangen sind

651643 wir sind super in die rallye gestartet und es war sch n nach dem ersten tag auf podiumskurs zu liegen
651644 das auto hat super funktioniert und ich hatte vom start weg eine schnelle pace aber am zweiten tag habe ich das feeling leider verloren und musste mich mit platz f nf begn gen der ist aber gar nicht so schlecht und bringt zumindest ein paar punkte ein damit habe ich mich in der weltmeisterschaft auf platz sieben verbessert
651645 wir hatten bei dieser rallye neue rennanz ge deshalb waren wir vielleicht nicht die schnellste crew aber wir waren definitiv die am besten aussehende crew
651646 die rallye ist f r mich mit einer bitteren entt uschung zu ende gegangen ich habe nur versucht meine position gegen daniel sordo zu verteidigen und der unfall ist in einer t ckischen linkskurve passiert mein aufschrieb hat nicht ganz gepasst und es hat damit geendet dass ich in den graben gerutscht bin das auto hat sich dann mit hoher geschwindigkeit berschlagen und ist in die b ume geflogen das auto ist schwer besch digt und es war offensichtlich eine kurve die es in sich hatte denn an der selben stelle sind noch zwei andere autos abgeflogen wir hatten einen guten rhythmus einen vern nftigen speed und ein gutes gef hl f r das auto deshalb denke ich nicht dass ich dort zu sehr gepusht habe
651647 das war wirklich eine harte rallye und wir haben schon f r kommendes jahr ein paar wichtige nderungen bei den settings erarbeitet
651648 bei dieser rallye z hlt vor allem erfahrung und da hat mir sicher geholfen dass ich bis ins ziel gekommen bin es ist stellenweise einfach schnell zu fahren aber man braucht auch die erfahrung und das selbstvertrauen

651687 two weeks went by then i got a cd in the post i listened to it and it was very strange it was this other person inhabiting my most personal song hearing it was like someone kissing your girlfriend it felt invasive
651688 having johnny cash one of the greatest singer songwriters of all time wants to cover your song thats something that matters to me its not so much what other people think but the honour that this guy felt it was worthy of interpreting
651689 he said afterwards it was a song that sounds like one he would have written in the 60s and thats wonderful

651748 stigma and discrimination is going to be a very important theme of this years conference and which is going to come up again and again over the next few days
651749 stigma discrimination and human rights would indeed be the focus of the conference
651750 when i started work on hiv and aids back in 1984 i assumed it would be over in ten years twenty seven years later it is still growing
651751 not a single country that has been declared aids free
651752 setting this precedence is very important indeed to stomp off stigma and discrimination and while we see this openness at international conferences we do not find the same replicated at national ones
651753 the growing hiv epidemic among the msm in asia reminds me of the times when it was found only in the west and australia the history of aids is one of surprises it pops up where and when you least expect and thus its far too early to declare victory

651807 is the next step for the fcc to mandate that network owners must ask the government for permission before serving their customers by managing surges of information flow

651863 it was the job of politicians and bankers to run the economy and he could not understand why they often failed to do so in a competent way it was he assumed something to do with their general venality and the fact that quite the wrong type went into politics and finance but it seemed as if there would never be any change in that and so they would have to put up with these insolent people and their persistent mismanagement

651866 was ist wenn dir einmal etwas passiert und ich nach dem simon schauen muss
651867 das brauchst du nicht rickie und walter haben einen schl ssel sie werden sich um ihn k mmern f r den fall dass mir etwas zust t
651868 aber er ist doch auch mein kind oder etwa nicht
651869 ihm war nicht gut deshalb ist er heute schon schlafen gegangen vielleicht bekommt er die grippe die geht momentan in der schule um
651870 aber fieber hat er keins also muss es nicht sein dass er die grippe bekommt
651871 nein bring mir kein bier ich trink lieber einen tee ich muss ja noch nach hause fahren
651872 wenn du mir die daten gegeben hast dann sind sie in meinem computer ich brauch die astrologie damit ich meine bilder deuten kann
651873 komm rein und bring den wein und die dose mit den keksen mit
651874 ich muss mir bald einen schnelleren computer kaufen wenn ich den martin frag ob er mir geld daf r gibt muss ich wieder mit ihm verhandeln aber wenn ich es ge schickt anstelle kann ich ihn berzeugen und er gibt mir das geld
651875 w rdest du mir bitte endlich sagen was du da siehst
651876 meine liebe kamilla es f llt mir nicht leicht dich das zu fragen
651877 frag mich ruhig ich will endlich wissen was du da siehst
651878 hast du dir schon einmal berlegt dass andie schwul sein k nnte
651879 wie kommst du denn auf diesen ab son der lichen gedanken
651880 ich kann dir nur sagen was ich hier sehe es muss nicht sein aber es gibt zwei nein drei hinweise daf r in seinem horoskop es ist nicht ausgeschlossen
651881 die astrologie kann homosexualit t nicht genau bestimmen das ist dasselbe wie mit intellektuellen begabungen aber die astrologie kann gewisse tendenzen aufzeigen ob es auch gelebt wird oder nicht das steht auf einem anderen blatt papier und jedem menschen frei willst du es h ren
651882 es ist nicht die wahrheit die schmerzt son dern ihre pl tzliche erkenntnis wie findest du diesen satz den hab ich unl ngst in einem alten film geh rt
651883 er kommt karmisch aus einer vergangenheit in der er eine sehr starke spirituelle frau verk rpert hat
651884 daran hab ich einmal denken m ssen als ich mit ihm zusammen auf einer decke im park gesessen bin f r einen kurzen augenblick hab ich damals nicht ihn gesehen sondern eine alte imposante frau das bild war sehr einpr gsam er hat auf mich gewirkt wie eine eingeborene aus s damerika
651885 bei aller bodenst ndigkeit wenn es um deinen beruf geht hast du doch auch eine sehr starke begabung zur intuition deshalb kannst du bilder sehen die anderen verborgen bleiben
651886 so eine konstellation wirkt bei vielen m nnern sehr stark nach viele werden sogar transvestiten oder transsexuell
651887 mir f llt ein dass es mir sehr gut gefallen hat wie er sich gleich in meiner k che zu schaf fen gemacht hat und neue rezepte von mir hat haben wollen das hat mich aber sehr gefreut und ich hab nicht l nger dar ber nachgedacht
651888 ich sag es ja nur ungern aber so sehr wir uns dar ber freuen wenn m nner gerne haus arbeit machen so steht doch zu bef rchten dass sie im bett ebenfalls lieber einen mann haben w rden so wie wir auch
651889 ich hab geglaubt du bist eine feministin ist dir klar was du da sagst
651890 m nner in der k che sind entweder normale m nner oder verkappte frauen oder die bes seren frauen die uns frauen zeigen wollen dass sie das auch k nnen und sogar besser k nnen als wir das hei t also nicht dass alle m nner die sich f r hausarbeit interessieren gleich schwul sein m ssen
651891 da f llt mir etwas ein klara jetzt bin ich sehr intim darf ich
651892 mir ist aufgefallen dass andie weder ein busenfetischist noch ein m senfetischist ist ver stehst du was ich damit sagen will
651893 aber nat rlich versteh ich dich m nner sind entweder das eine oder das andere oder sie m gen beides und wenn sie nicht eines von beiden aus tiefster inbrunst verg ttern muss frau sich gedanken machen ob er nicht lieber einen mann im bett haben will
651894 vor ein paar wochen hast du zu mir gesagt andie ist ein unsteter geist ich werd mich nie ganz darauf verlassen k n nen was er gerade f hlt oder sagt das kann heute so und morgen wieder ganz anders sein
651895 vielleicht berlegt er es sich ja wieder anders und will eines tages doch eine beziehung
651896 nachdem was ich jetzt ber ihn erfahren hab bin ich mir nicht mehr sicher ob ich ihn berhaupt noch haben will warum soll ich gegen seine homoerotik konkurrieren
651897 aber auch wenn es nicht um unterdr ckte homosexualit t geht sondern um unterdr ckte hetero sexualit t ist andie ein anschauliches beispiel daf r was ein mann anrichten kann wenn er seinen unterleib vollkommen ausschaltet
651898 du meinst er verh lt sich wie ein mann ohne unterleib weil er seine potenz ausschaltet
651899 h tte andie nicht tendenzen zur frigidit t w re ihm die wunder bare nacht mit mir im nachhinein nicht unangenehm gewesen und er h tte nicht so getan als h tte sie nicht stattgefunden
651900 genau andie ist bereits in einem alter in dem die potenz nachl sst da bekommen viele m nner angst vor frauen die meisten laufen wie er davon wenn ihnen eine leib haftige frau wie du begegnet
651901 ich dank dir ich glaub deshalb bin ich heute noch so sp t zu dir gekommen damit hast du mich wie der aufgebaut
651902 um gottes willen es ist schon viertel nach eins ich muss jetzt gehen
651903 vielleicht geh rt er zur mental kastrierten gattung seiner spezies so wie frauen in unseren brei ten nur mental beschnitten sind und nicht wirklich wie so viele frauen in afrika
651904 warum hab ich dauernd das gef hl mein schicksal verwehrt mir mein gl ck
651905 kamilla es ist nicht dein schicksal es ist dein wille dein egoistisches wollen das sich dir in den weg stellt
651906 am beistand und am wohl wollen der g tt lich keit gibt es keinen zweifel aber du musst zuerst damit aufh ren wie ein trotziges m dchen zu schreien was du vom leben willst du musst jetzt herausfinden was das leben von dir will dann wirst du vom leben das bekommen was du willst und was du brauchst und dann werden sich die dinge f gen du wirst schon sehen
651907 du meinst ich will mit andie etwas herbeizwingen was mein schicksal nicht f r mich vor gesehen hat
651908 ja meine liebe so ist es leider jedenfalls empfinde ich es so das muss nicht hei en dass ich recht habe aber daher k nnte dein gef hl kommen dir werden steine in den weg gelegt die ungereimtheiten und die tatsache dass es nicht so geht wie du dir das vor stellst f hren dir deutlich vor augen dass du dich auf einem holzweg befindest
651909 im brigen hat meine vermutung gestimmt hab ich dir das eigentlich schon er z hlt
651910 seltsam wie sich kreise schlie en k nnen hanna hat mir von ihrem freund gregor er z hlt der lange zeit sehr ungl cklich war nachdem ihn sein langj hriger lebens ge f hr te verlassen hat und jetzt ist er total verliebt in einen mann der vormals mit einer frau verheiratet war und einen sohn hat ich frag also nach rein aus neugier und stell dir vor das muss dein ehemaliger andie sein jedenfalls hei t er so und so wie sie ihn mir beschrieben hat hat mich das sehr daran erinnert was du mir ber ihn erz hlt hast
651911 es muss nicht stimmen ich glaub es halt weil es so viele parallelen gibt
651912 bald ich w rde noch gerne mit der klara reden habt ihr noch ein wenig geduld
651913 mama wenn ihr uns unterwegs noch ein eis kauft dann k nnt ihr zwei euch noch ein paar minuten auf die seite stehlen und fertig geheimnissen
651914 melanie sei doch so lieb und geh mit dem simon noch eins kaufen ja
651915 warum muss ich immer f r solche sachen herhalten ich kann doch nichts daf r dass der simon so ungeschickt ist
651916 ja ich versteh mich auch wesentlich besser mit ihr als mit stefan aber sie kommt in die pubert t vor ein paar wochen hab ich das bei leon deutlich gemerkt
651917 sie wollte nicht auf ihn h ren er hat ihr gesagt dass er dabei sein will wenn sie zu den pfer den auf seiner koppel will und als er dann gekommen ist hat sie bereits eines seiner pfer de gesattelt und war dabei aufzusteigen
651918 so jetzt sag schon was du noch erz hlen willst
651919 nein sicher bin ich mir nicht aber wir haben w hrend meiner fruchtbaren tage miteinander geschlafen
651920 ich hab mich an deinen rat gehalten wenns im bett passt dann passts erinnerst du dich
651921 siehst du jetzt verstehst du vielleicht was zwischen dem martin und mir ist
651922 es ist als ob er dich auf h nden tr gt und du schreien k nntest vor gl ck
651923 ja genauso ist es klara es ist wie fliegen wie die stimme von jessyi norman wie das deutsche requiem von brahms als w rdest du direkt in den himmel entschweben
651924 unbewusst hast du bereits eine entscheidung getroffen wenn du tats chlich schwanger bist es tut mir nur leid dass du aufs land ziehen wirst aber dar ber dass du ein kind bekommst freu ich mich sehr
651925 wir fahren frau rainer in die geburtenklinik am berg sie hat eine fehlgeburt
651926 das wars dann wohl ich kann mich nicht entscheiden nun hat mir die fehlgeburt den weg gewiesen ich werde nicht zu leon ziehen

651941 people know about artificial intelligence but the perception is that robots are cold and calculating industrial automatons
651942 but over the last decade there has been a new field where robots have become the opposite of that
651943 they can make and receive calls they have an address book they can send and receive sms and the built in alarm is very popular

651955 we would pick what we could send back paper adjustments and then they would have to make adjustments and send that information back to us the entire process was essentially manual
651956 as far as that system knew every item in our warehouse had one location where it was stored but in reality we would have that item in two or three places things were just getting scattered and we had no real control or visibility into our inventory
651957 we had a lot of big deep locations that would hold twelve pallets we had gone over to a system called bailment where the vendors actually own what is in our warehouse so a lot of them started doing vendor managed inventory where they were keeping track of how much was in our warehouse the process became a little closer to just in time jit where they would have just a couple of weeks supply the issue was that these big deep locations were meant to hold a couple months worth instead of a couple of weeks so we had a lot of space that was assigned to an item that wasnt being utilized
651958 our product line was in the beginning of an expansion period that still continues to this day
651959 we were reaching the point where we were going to start shipping orders incomplete because we were not able to get items to the pick locations in time to meet the shipments
651960 we were spending a lot of time looking for things there was a pretty high cost i had two to three employees that were spending all of their time looking for the stuff and other people were picking up their work so the work level had increased dramatically for everybody but we werent seeing any increased productivity and in fact we were losing opportunity
651961 after looking at the various products on the market robocom was the only vendor that had exactly what we were looking for and they provided us with answers to all of our questions rims was a really good fit for our needs
651962 we completed the implementation in half the time of robocoms previous shortest install it took just 16 weeks from start to acceptance and it was really much shorter than that because there were four weeks at the end where we were up and running and doing some little debugging once we switched over to live testing we never went back user adoption has been very successful within days everyone was using the system and we were immediately seeing efficiency improvements
651963 as soon as an item is received on the floor our legacy system knows and it has been added to that inventory so we have immediate visibility
651964 as we pick it then creates more replenishment not for the orders but to keep minimum stock levels at each of the pick locations a crucial step for maintaining our efficiency levels and meeting customer demand
651965 everything that is done with our distribution center is done with rims
651966 if we move a product from one spot on the floor to another we scan it from one location to another so all of our receipts all of our product movement all of our order fulfillment they are all done with rims
651967 previously we shipped about 1 8 million cases per year and this year we are projecting we will do about 2 8 million we can attribute that dramatic change to the fact that we are running a more efficient business there is no way we could be getting that much out the door if we werent using rims
651968 we are shipping a million more cases a year and at the same time also receiving a million more so that is two million more cases that we are actually managing to only add eight employees over six years while realizing that kind of growth is phenomenal
651969 i can go into a screen in rims and i can call up an item and i can look and see how many cases we have in each location how much movement there is planned whether it is just re warehouse movement or picks to fulfill an order i can look at the receiving floor and see how many pallets are there waiting to be stored i can look at individual orders for today tomorrow if an agent calls with a question about an order i can immediately look it up and give them the information they need the system gives me everything i need at my fingertips there is no more guessing or hunting for inventory we now have total control over our warehouse
651970 we gained a 33 efficiency increase meaning we are able to store 33 more despite losing 25 of our physical storage space
651971 rims is flexible enough that all of our additional physical changes have been very easily accommodated by rims to give us that visibility
651972 we have some deliveries that arent being made until 4 00 or 5 00 in the evening because we only ship out of one door
651973 we have 1100 cases an hour we are able to ship out the door but the more cases we have it just makes for that much longer of a day so we are looking at adding sortation to our conveyer system
651974 robocom has put us in contact with some vendors and they are helping us try to solve this issue and meet our goals that is the benefit of working with robocom they have become a true partner for the long haul i feel very lucky that we found robocom they are such a good fit i am very thankful that things have worked out as nicely as they have
651975 previously we shipped about 1 8 million cases per year and this year we are projecting we will do about 2 8 million we can attribute that dramatic change to the fact that we are running a more efficient business there is no way we could be getting that much out the door if we werent using rims
651976 we are shipping a million more cases a year and at the same time also receiving a million more so that is two million more cases that we are actually managing to only add eight employees over six years while realizing that kind of growth is phenomenal
651977 deshalb gehe ich eher davon aus dass der markt schw chelt und volatil bleibt wir sind noch nicht an dem punkt an dem die bullen aus dem gatter kommen
651978 wir sind skeptisch ob die rally der vergangenen wochen die trendwende bedeutet und rechnen damit dass sich der dax in den kommenden wochen wieder in richtung 6000 punkte bewegt

651984 many of them may have to join the ranks of sex workers for a living
651985 if all u s jobs were moved to china there would still be surplus labor in china
651986 we would not be able to support china if it failed
651987 irreversible and it is only natural that the chinese people are happy and proud about it
651988 we ve all probably been at a party or in a pub where someone has said something nasty about
651989 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
651990 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement
651991 the real contest is always between what youve done and what youre capable of doing you measure yourself against yourself and nobody else
651992 without passion man woman is a mere latent force and possibility like the flint which awaits the shock of the iron before it can give forth its spark

652009 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
652010 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
652011 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
652012 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
652013 it is a new low for the international community to see all these state leaders going to beijing without saying anything about the repressive environment in which the games are being held
652014 thousands of people including petitioners who have gone to beijing seeking justice from the government have been swept up in efforts to clean up the city before the games
652015 they said they were hired by the hospital and surveillance will last for the next four months it is said the olympics are approaching so they worry about us petitioners
652016 the police come to my place waiting outside and i do not know what they want to do with me
652017 because of the olympics approaching people like me nothing more than a rights defenders wife are being specially protected by the government

652021 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
652022 there were also bombing incidents in pakistan subsequently but we have not pointed fingers at anyone as we believe in carrying out investigations before laying responsibility
652023 such baseless accusations serve no purpose other than vitiating the bilateral atmosphere

652037 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
652038 they have to settle all their differences otherwise it will lead to a crisis in all iraqi cities
652039 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
652040 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city
652041 a successful design doesnt tell us how close to failure it might be
652042 typically the longer you go without a failure the more confident we become

652044 that bridge was built deliberately as a slender aesthetically pleasing bridge
652045 and all the lessons from the 19th century that john roebling had laid out in the brooklyn bridge had been forgotten

652047 the most popular slogan about harry truman as president was to err is truman his public opinion polls were in the 20s
652048 now truman is the name of one of our 4 or 5 great presidents

652052 well most of the time its not and thats why you have to be able to accept failure
652053 its a lot of work to do here in the big league is how you accept failure you learn from your failures you come back you apply what you learned your previous at bat to your next at bat and hopefully you get a base hit hopefully you get a home run
652054 a mere seven years after my graduation day i had failed on an epic scale an exceptionally short lived marriage had imploded and i was jobless a lone parent and as poor as it is possible to be in modern britain without being homeless
652055 and so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which i rebuilt my life
652056 it is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all in which case you fail by default
652057 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
652058 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
652059 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
652060 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
652061 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
652062 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
652063 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
652064 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
652065 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
652066 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
652067 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
652068 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
652069 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
652070 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
652071 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
652072 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
652073 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
652074 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
652075 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
652076 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
652077 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
652078 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
652079 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
652080 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
652081 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
652082 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
652083 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
652084 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
652085 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
652086 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
652087 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
652088 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
652089 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
652090 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
652091 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
652092 jack if you sit here and smile for just one more minute mommy will buy you a race car that can travel to the moon
652093 i never teach my pupils i only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn
652094 it is gratifying that we are on track to grow our annual revenues in excess of 30 for the sixth consecutive year
652095 these financial accomplishments reflect the decisions of hundreds of doctors and patients to use remodulin and make it the leading form of prostacyclin therapy in the united states
652096 this will be a big one the iphone 3g has been the fastest selling phone ever in the uk but it is too expensive to be a realistic proposition in the pay as you go market
652097 however a cut down version with the candy bar shape of ipod nano music players would be a huge hit as a christmas gift
652098 touch wheel on the back and display on the front so that numbers would be dialled from behind
652099 a fascinating read for anyone with an interest in the amazing world where science meets crime
652100 the exciting part of this study is that we have discovered a completely new process that regulates the adverse responses to bad memories
652101 these findings can help the development of new drugs to treat conditions in which people are haunted by persistent fears such as posttraumatic stress disorder or other panic disorders
652102 we decided to head for a big city cmon could you say i bet no so standing in front of the notebook inserting the dates names and credit card number we did more than only crossing fingers we really really believed in going to

652105 you watch all games on the weekend and teams lift and drop and the better teams like geelong their intensity is very consistent throughout the game
652106 ours at the moment just wavers and goes up and goes down and with a lot of teams were seeing that happening
652107 it hurts because better players are better players but thats just the reality of where youre at
652108 an audaciously designed 45 000 s f gallery would beautifully serve the university as a gateway park like attraction on the entire block east of belvidere bordered by broad henry and grace streets the sites proximity to the new fine arts building and the burgeoning gallery scene along west broad would draw focus and make a powerful statement for vcu it is my understanding that a portion of that property is on the market

652113 glad to hear from you and thanks for your thoughts on this
652114 you are right to be proud of and interested in your home town it is an amazing city i am not a native and i think it is one of the most remarkable cities around i just love it the site of our new gallery is at the moment dictated by two factors one is that the site has been approved by the board of visitors in the master plan of some years standing and the second is much more pragmatic vcu already owns the site property wed have to dig around and raise quite a bit more money were we to build on broad street and we have more than enough to raise as it is

652116 gee if i felt those feelings with everyone it would be like being in love with everyone

652118 father our name is yours in it we are united with all living things and you who are their one creator what we made and call by many different names is but a shadow we have tried to cast across your own reality and we are glad and thankful we were wrong all our mistakes we give to you that we may be absolved of all effects our errors seemed to have and we accept the truth you give in place of every one of them your name is our salvation and escape from what we made your name unites us in the oneness which is our inheritance and peace amen

652120 where a lot of these houses have turned into rental properties were trying to acquire the empty lots and turn them back into homeownership to stabilize the neighborhood get families back in the neighborhood that way we can hopefully attract more commercial development more products and services for people and try to build it back into the once thriving neighborhood that it was
652121 this level of enrollment will increase the demand for university services including on campus housing well beyond normal levels
652122 no money until you figure out what you need to build to be successful
652123 we believe that once implemented theyll better protect at risk children than we were able to do before
652124 you want to make sure that if youve got an abuse or neglect referral youre sending to another county you want to make sure that they got it that they follow up appropriately on that referral
652125 what we have to do to train workers the best we can to give them the best tools possible to improve their ability to make the appropriate decisions
652126 so that we might prevent some of these things from occurring
652127 we cant say that we can ever prevent them completely
652128 if you are into aggressive polished black metal that is well executed then youre going to love de oppresso liber weve been able to capture some incredible performances and couple them with some very talented engineers we wanted to make a record that we would be genuinely proud of and weve accomplished that

652177 our forces have arrested 265 suspects so far during our operations in diyala
652178 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
652179 we have to stop rallies and marches or anything that leads to mass gatherings
652180 what they say hamas is doing in gaza they are doing here
652181 those members who have increased their production should control it
652182 we have the responsibility to control the market and to be serious about
652183 the fact is that were police forces there we understood that like last week when there was a violent incident when they the hikers came to them the bedouin with weapons we were ready because we knew that this was a place of confrontation they bedouin set up cameras and therefore the police were there
652184 if the police were there and watched the confrontation what was the problem of the police to stand openly and prevent them the hikers from passing and if it was not permitted to stop them the situation as i see it looks like an ambush somebody hides out like thieves in the night
652185 im not the one who decides there are officers above me who decide what is overt and what is concealed
652186 you agree that special police forces were in the area at that time
652187 they wore a police hat and they shouted that they are police and identified themselves as police some were in a hiding place and some waited on alert
652188 all of sudden policemen disguised as civilians but with police hats suddenly came out from behind a small hill and arrested the person who shot in the air and some of the armed escorts
652189 police were surprised that to see how we managed to break through their barriers and we appeared 200 youths under their noses
652190 this incident is the direct result of a police provocation
652191 there is an outpost next to kochav hashachar where tens or hundreds of people intended to pass by openly the police were hiding out in the place in collusion with the bedouin when the bedouin at least thats the version we have began to attack verbally and physically the hikers until they withdrew and defended themselves
652192 the respondents do not have any criminal past but we are talking about a serious incident which could have ended differently
652193 after i have considered all the actions that are attributed to the respondents in the incident i am heeding the words of the petitioners representative that other such incidents can be expected in the near future
652194 as far as we know they havent turned to us
652195 hadmi will not be returning to the laboratories or to the university the hebrew university has agreed to review his thesis to determine if he is eligible to continue on to a phd but he has been specifically barred from the laboratory due to security considerations
652196 according to the law even ex cons must be given the opportunity to educate themselves and so we have agreed to examine his written work without allowing him into the university

652198 the israeli public will be able to continue its support of the process as long as it expresses the interests of the state of israel
652199 even if the situation in southern lebanon has changed the smuggling of weapons from syria to lebanon requires an immediate response syria must understand that it is unacceptable
652200 all international activity in the region must be aimed at preventing the extremists from being recognized as legitimate and this is true for gaza as well the opening of the rafah crossing must be linked to gilad shalit and if it is opened this must be done in coordination with palestinian authority forces in a manner that prevents the strengthening of hamas

652211 could be discussed in schools in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
652212 what is not fine is to say there are these two theories one is called evolution the other is called genesis if you are going to say that then you should talk about the nigerian tribe who believe the world was created from the excrement of ants
652213 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
652214 i was shocked by how some put up barriers to understanding
652215 i showed them the evidence and they just said this is what it says in my holy book and so i asked if your holy book says one thing but the evidence says something else you then go with your holy book and they said yes and i said why and they said its the way weve been brought up
652216 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with
652217 the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multi culturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing
652218 i would like to see evolution taught a lot earlier there should be no problem teaching it to eight year olds
652219 for parents to deprive their children of an educational opportunity because of a traditional bigotry is unfair on the child
652220 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist
652221 its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic

652269 and i knew i wouldnt be going to the olympics with the u s team
652270 i would do my best to help my team win because its basketball and thats what you do
652271 a couple of the games have been strange especially with the officials calling things and the ball being slippery but you live and you learn
652272 a pick and roll is still a pick and roll and a post up is still a post up
652273 besides on this team you can go to dirk hes one of the best players in the world and hes just been unstoppable
652274 it reminds me of playing at central michigan where everybody was like a family and you hung out and stuff
652275 im not worrying about it now because i cant control it
652276 it sounds like we will have different guys i know i just want to win i hope we have guys who want to win thats what basketball should be about
652277 he wants to show some of the other athletes what it is because he is telling them what it has done for him
652278 thats what we believe and we find comfort in that even when we hear the criticism
652279 the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
652280 i had to spend fifteen minutes and a jumbo packet of schitoff cleaning up after your last visit now what do you want
652281 no i just mean that she found a way of passing matter through matter without molesting either
652282 if your theory is correct and its one that i find most attractive rather like yourself despite your tail i wonder if we might find evidence of it in the stinging nettle patch that lies just behind this freezer
652283 but havent the police gone over everywhere with a fine tooth comb already
652284 they went over it with size twelve boots the worthless scum all evidence will have been crushed beneath them
652285 what fabulous fun she must be having teleporting herself all over the place like that
652286 i shall join the fight against the oppression unfairness and general ghastliness that i have discovered in this foul land of prannick the wheel is absolutely rotten i dont like it its exponents are total bastards who deserve to either die horribly or get sent to some putrid place of slime and unpleasantness where their fingernails will crack and their reproductive organs will atrophy into uselessness
652287 i just overheard two passing wood mice talking about a stix meeting being held in some place called kinell if cavies get to vote im raising my paw to the suggestion that we get our bored asses outta here
652288 theyre built on opposite banks of the turgid river did they mention which kinell
652289 now how the hell am i supposed to know that
652290 its more than three hop skip and jumps to the woodland track i could barely make out a word of what they said are they north and south or east and west
652291 those sure are dumb names i guess he musta been talkin bout far kinell yeah the stix meetings in far kinell
652292 i know of a short cut there via 96 and old drainage pipe if we move muy r pido we can arrive before the caf con leche and buttered scones are shared out during the intermission
652293 i havent enjoyed the texture of a buttered scone since nanny used one to placate me that time when she was forced to smear an unpleasant balm upon my chafed privates after id indulged in some tactile experimentation inside a chain mail jerkin but lets not get into that right now if its stix time then im ready to do my bit and let no rodent dare stand in my way
652294 oh how i curse those ancient drainage pipe builders for making them so small and regard my brass helmet everyone its got all scratched by the low ceiling
652295 some will tell you that the wheel brings peace and prosperity to prannick that as a direct result of its rule we have equality for all rodents but is this true
652296 it was a rhetorical question flossy we all know the answer to it its no
652297 since youre so keen to slag off the wheel in public what you had to say about what they say about our chattels its a reasonable enough question though perhaps not particularly pertinent
652298 youre bloody right it aint pertinent ya daft old bastard
652299 were supposed to be rabble rousing not having a reasonable discussion concerning the merits of the autocracy that rules us with an iron paw now shut up or go fluff yourself
652300 a hamster after my own heart i like this fellow though not in a sexual sort of way of course
652301 i say i think ive seen this fellow nosing about in the market place 99 does anyone know who he is
652302 listen to him calling me a twerp thats a sure sign of a law master spy i reckon lets hang him up from the nearest rhubarb tree by his scrotum
652303 what and countenance the actions of the wheel we are stix sir we desire nothing more than justice throughout our realm only logic and honest evidence shall convict you
652304 its the forces of the wheel run run for your lives
652305 bring all the known stix to me the rest take them to far kinell town hall incarcerate them with inconsolable misery make their 102 bindings hurt or take away their chairs that sort of thing i want them all to suffer in some form or other empty the snack bar and douse the fire in the range make it all nasty and smoky for them yes and have the toilets blocked too let them wallow in their own filth
652306 kitchen they have a fake little stove with missing knobs 3 or 4 little pots and pans and one filthy doll theyre fighting over

652334 this sort of thing if it continues would make the iraq war worthwhile to the military industrial complex if you want to turn an enemy into a customer nothing does the trick like conquering the difficult population
652335 john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct
652336 no soy yo y me da mucha jartera que est n diciendo eso con tanto chisme solo terminan haci ndole da o a uno
652337 aside from your chinese studies why are we here what is it that we can do here that we cant do in the us
652338 wait a damn second im supposed to talk to your parents first stop
652339 why the internet is awesome and sucks at the same time
652340 hey maybe if try searching for breasts instead of nude i might find some more jerkoff material
652341 gee youve seemed really down lately and i feel bad for you
652342 johnny what do you think of quintylun raye and rocky white could they do a job for us
652343 i am not sure boss they both have ability but have been running behind a poor line but raye is proven blocker and would be a good asset if you can get him
652344 we need to replace dante even though i know you have a high opinion of roman clem we could do well to have him sharing duties for one more season
652345 i understand that but i think roman is good enough to carry the lead blocking
652346 boss the only guy i think we could offer up is dalman
652347 well i sure aint pitching out a big contract if we dont get walker then we can go for a free agent if we dont get who we want from the draft
652348 we are a team on the up but i am not kidding you about how tough this is going to be this is the hardest division to win and if that is not the sort of challenge you want then say so now
652349 good because your experience will be valuable and you can be a leader on and off the field you won a starbowl ring once at boston you can do it again here
652350 we leaked to many sacks last season and that has to stop that was number one on the to do list
652351 the scheme we used with dante wilkerson blocking was not working at first i thought it was a weakness in his play but analysis showed that we had slow pick ups
652352 that is the key issue here i am not saying mission accomplished but we have a very powerful offensive line taking shape the guys have signed long contracts so this unit will stick together we need you to lead them
652353 if iowa drop 5 places in the first round i think they may go for 2 consecutive 5 th round picks for 2004 and 2005
652354 boss they may want a 3 rd round pick this season for dropping down
652355 if we lose reuben then we can get elvis rutledge in the 2
652356 he could be overlooked because he dont have the 40 yard sprint that gammon has but he can turn
652357 get on the phone to the gamblers and find out what they want for one the picks
652358 we can get randall aplin if we offer up a linebacker
652359 coach out of cris little or darryl oconnell who can afford to let go
652360 boss i dont want to lose either of them but in a pinch i guess darryl gives them a better option
652361 yes but we need to pick a linebacker no later than our 6 th
652362 mike rudy tells me that you are unhappy with our decision not to re sign emil piazza
652363 oh what word do you think best suits your opinion
652364 in fact i think the decision not to transition emil is also bad
652365 i know that you were concerned over that but there was a strong arguement to transition lamar brown
652366 mike the options were discussed and it was agreed that the priority in the opening bids was the line we have conceeded an average of 77 sacks in the past 2 years and dropped to 10th in overall rushing thats unacceptable we all said that had to be fixed so thats what i have done
652367 well it has happened so there is no gain in bemoaning the outcome however
652368 the main thing is coach that we continue to develop our younger talent
652369 you know what the plural of pussy is pusssss eye jimmy taught me that
652370 you can have him that mcnulty son of a bitch is dead to me
652371 do you see what happened to pat burns do you do you see what happens when you fuck the montreal canadiens in the ass motherfucker
652372 hey im the dude that shes been cheating with for the last 9 months
652373 i hear you had a little breakdown a few weeks ago over some chick thats banging another dude and you still think shes going to fuck you
652374 when people are free to do what they please they usually imitate each other
652375 there is a principle which is a bar against all information which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation
652376 odd is one bad problem there is no one thing that will probably fix it make sure you are not prematurely ruling out any of the possible interventions above if you are not careful it can destroy you long before it ruins the kid if nothing is done the outcome can be dismal it is absolutely key to keep working to do everything you can to keep this problem from devastating your life and your childs
652377 if we cant settle this im getting discouraged about if we can settle any claims
652378 on the side of being fair and generous as final and full compensation
652379 ive given up making predictions but i hope to be back at the table in the next couple of weeks

652414 it should be illegal for educators to read friedman before littky meier or sizer
652415 then theres the social cost of free trade for over a decade free trade has hovered over the political system like a biblical commandment striking down anything trade unions the environment indigenous rights even the constitutional standing of our own laws passed by our elected representative that gets in the way of unbridled greed the broader negative consequences of this agenda increasingly well documented by scholars gets virtually no attention in the dominant media instead of reality we get optimistic multicultural scenarios of coordinated global growth and instead of substantive debate we get a stark formulated choice between free trade to help the world and gloomy sounding protectionism that will set everyone back
652416 the degree to which this has become a purely ideological debate devoid of any factual basis that people can weigh the gains and losses is reflected in thomas friedmans astonishing claim stated not long ago in a television interview that he endorsed the central american free trade agreement cafta without even reading it

652450 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
652451 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny
652452 carrying an awkward asymmetric load such as the infant on one side of the body is the most energetically expensive way of transporting the weight
652453 unless infant carrying resulted in significant benefits elsewhere the high cost of carrying an asymmetrical weight suggests that infant carrying was unlikely to have been the evolutionary driving force behind bipedalism
652454 im suggesting that the dogs in the new world in the southwest were used to escort people into the next world and sometimes they were used in certain rituals in place of people

652480 a young rss leader named satheesan was brutally killed in the beginning of the 80s by cpm dyfi goondas
652481 the violence will stop once the cpm recognises our right to hold shakhas and conduct everyday political activity he says

652492 ho deciso di rimanere con la squadra siamo giocatori sappiamo che queste cose possono succedere ora il mio pensiero va a giorgio chiellini non facciamo lerrore di perdere due giocatori invece di uno solo giorgio un ragazzo eccezionale e ora a pezzi ripeto queste sono cose che capitano ora se scender in campo e segner un gol sapr a chi dedicarlo
652493 i tempi di recupero ha spiegato ferretti anche se prematuro fare previsioni sono intorno ai due mesi
652494 ho deciso di rimanere spiega cannavaro perch quando per due anni si lavora ad un progetto ti sembra giusto rimanere con i tuoi compagni cercher di essere utile nei momenti di difficolt ora il mio obiettivo sono i mondiali del 2010 mi dovete sopportare per altri due anni peccato ci tenevo a questo europeo perch avevo giocato gli altri due e uno lavevo perso in finale laltro era andato male in portogallo ora prendo questa disavventura come una nuova sfida
652495 e stato uno scontro con chiellini ma sono cose che capitano ho capito subito che qualcosa si era rotto perch il dolore stato troppo forte pensavo anche a qualcosa di peggio poi per fortuna non c stata nessuna lesione ossea
652496 sono pi tranquillo io del mister questo un gruppo fatto di campioni del mondo e sono sicuro che i miei compagni faranno benissimo sono rimasto apposta ho grande fiducia in questa squadra tutti sono stati felici per questa mia decisione ieri mi sono bastati cinque minuti nel reparto dellospedale quando ho visto entrare bambini che piangevano per capire che una caviglia che si rompe cosa di poco conto
652497 mi hanno telefonato in tanti da calderon a casillas ho sentito thuram sicuramente dimentico qualcuno ringrazio tutti quelli che mi hanno chiamato o massaggiato ora il mio obiettivo tornare a correre ed essere pronto in due mesi

652503 el m s insignificante de los hombres deja una reliquia su pantal n su medalla pero son pocos los que dejan un a obra por ello la reliquias me deprimen y las obras me exaltan el mudo adem s de los personajes marginales de mis cuentos soy yo mismo y eso quiz s porque desde otra perspectiva yo sea tambi n un marginal
652504 toda la gente me considera un escritor muy sombr o muy tr gico es decir pesimista cuando hay yo creo cosas muy divertidas yo me divierto mucho cuando escribo
652505 el hombre es un animal solitario si cree en algo se enga a si procura algo fracasa la vida es un proceso irremediablemente destructivo la historia de la humanidad un melanc lico disparate
652506 la vida no tiene sentido y por tanto no hay que empe arse en buscarlo

652511 to reduce carbon emissions and environmental damage through the investment and licensing of commercially practical environmentally clean technologies
652512 for 11 years you failed to act failing to ratify kyoto failing to act to the national emissions trading scheme failing to set a carbon target failing to do anything about renewable energy i think on all those questions mr howard its a very poor record indeed
652513 what will be your policy to manage the emissions target of 60 by 2050
652514 how could it be that were one of the only two developed countries in the world to refuse to ratify the kyoto protocol i dont understand i just dont get it
652515 what we do nationally is important within australia but what we do internationally in partnership with other countries is doubly important because unless we bring other countries like china india and america into an international system which brings down greenhouse gas emissions then we are not actually solving the problem part of solving the problem therefore is through international co operation and whats the vehicle for doing that ratifying
652516 set up the 500 million clean coal fund to promote clean coal technology

652520 the only thing wrong with peace is that you cant make any money from it
652521 because of the lack of demand the price has therefore collapsed
652522 buyers in new south wales are pretty much sure a national emissions trading scheme will trump the new south wales scheme and as a result have stopped buying in the market
652523 to stop dithering on this important issue and immediately release the details of its plan to transition to a new national emissions trading market
652524 they totally ignored our submissions and recommendations that you should make the target tougher that you should increase the penalty in order to get a much better greenhouse result from this scheme
652525 if easy being green and similar businesses go out of business then there is a lot less activity happening to cut electricity consumption and that means theyll sell more power so add it up for yourself as to what their self interest is and where their behaviour will as a result be driven
652526 any climate change pollution that comes from it is the responsibility of the federal government
652527 its been pretty hard for us the past week everything has been up in there and its tough to get the news that youre now out of a job we dont really think that anyone has handled the situation very well but yeah we hope ebg can keep going somehow in the future it was great what we were doing

652533 nearly 20 percent of the sea ice in the far north has been lost in the last 20 years
652534 only in northern canada and northwestern greenland are polar bears expected to survive through the end of the century
652535 despite any mitigation of greenhouse gases we are going to see the same amount of energy gases in the system the next 20 30 or 40 years
652536 instead of meeting the challenge the bush administration is happy to float along waiting to see if the planet and polar bears will sink or swim
652537 waste exhaust heat from the microturbine is captured and used to heat a rotating desiccant wheel that dries incoming ambient air dry air can then be cooled to provide cooling and humidity control for the library
652538 trigeneration was selected as the best opportunity to achieve deep cuts in buildings co2 emissions performance shows approximately a 20 reduction in co2 emissions
652539 the products fitted into your home reduce greenhouse gas pollution creating carbon credits when you assign those carbon credits to easy being green we then trade them through the scheme this covers the cost of the products and installation which is why we can afford to give you the products free of charge
652540 cfls contain a very small amount of mercury sealed within the glass tubing an average of 5 milligrams roughly equivalent to the tip of a ball point pen
652541 by comparison older home thermometers contain 500 milligrams of mercury and many manual thermostats contain up to 3000 milligrams
652542 if a cfl breaks in your home open nearby windows to disperse any vapor that may escape carefully sweep up the fragments do not use your hands and wipe the area with a disposable paper towel to remove all glass fragments do not use a vacuum place all fragments in a sealed plastic bag and follow disposal instructions

652548 the current debt limit is 8 965 trillion unless congress votes to raise that ceiling the country would be

652555 i spent my times and my skill for them my students 90 percent are workers and farmers most of fighters ports producers
652556 if someone not too hurt the fee paid by ministry is fair
652557 we must encourage young people to be involved with the bokator
652558 the more money they earn from the fight the more fighters participate with bokator

652566 yet those who got to know vince weiguang li well soon recognized that beneath his friendly polite exterior lurked something very troubling
652567 he was kind of a lost soul it was as if he was always looking for something
652568 they say li was clearly battling mental illness but refused repeated offers to see a doctor and get help
652569 i think in their culture the issue of mental illness is kind of frowned upon the woman said she works in the mental health field and said it was obvious li was struggling
652570 he was definitely schizophrenic probably paranoid schizophrenic she said he needed help but he just wouldnt get it

652635 the skin cancer turned out to be ballpoint ink the meningitis hay fever the pancreatitis too many candy bars the blood poisoning ill fitting shoes
652636 we try to keep innovating and raising the bar with new product lines including supermarket takeaway bags and pick and mix
652637 it was not our fault as we had a strong profitable growing business but it made life difficult
652638 i have no formal qualifications i learnt my trade by doing it and by learning from the accountants how to do the wages and payslips warsi says now entirely family owned the company makes 1 25 million ready meals a week employs 600 staff and turns over more than 60m a year
652639 pakistan needs to get everybody lined up in the same direction if they are really going to tackle the terrorist problem
652640 our view is that it is important to have a good intelligence service in pakistan but it is also important for that intelligence service to work single mindedly with other institutions to tackle the terrorist issue that affects so many people in pakistan and its neighbourhood
652641 thanks to the self sacrificing work of our forestry authorities the fire has generally speaking being brought under control although it is still continuing
652642 this fire is the most significant one that we have faced on anatolian lands in recent years
652643 the weather was in our favour last night but the wind flared up again this morning despite this we will have the fire totally under control today
652644 but its simply really difficult to say whats going on in this huge chinese market
652645 chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti doping campaign
652646 i think we have the means to deal with this problem
652647 theres never a guarantee that sports events are clean youll always have athletes who will try to cheat its extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld
652648 every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once
652649 there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others we naturally have to take that into account
652650 both players showed good movement and so did steven gerrard
652651 dirk kuyt and yossi benayoun were coming inside so i felt we had five offensive players very clever and with quality so we were a threat all the time
652652 keane is very clever and he worked hard he is very happy here and hopefully we will see a lot of good movement and also goals from him
652653 gerrard torres and keane playing together was one of the keys to keeping possession
652654 the first half was okay but in the second half they needed to go forward in front of their supporters
652655 we had more space and we scored the second goal on the counter attack
652656 but from the start of the game we wanted to impress and we wanted to win
652657 we worked hard had plenty of possession and wanted to keep a high tempo with the ball
652658 we scored once and had one or two problems near the end of the first half but we controlled it
652659 we do not have any strikers apart from wayne rooney and carlos tevez and frazier plays in that area
652660 he took his goal really well and that wont do him any harm
652661 chelsea want to speak and i am open to talk
652662 things have not changed but i am a blues player
652663 i would like to have scored but unfortunately it wasnt to be
652664 i have had many highs and lows and i cant think him enough for the way he stuck by me
652665 he is the best and if i cannot learn from him i wont learn from anyone
652666 i could probably bring ole on for the last 10 minutes even now and he wouldnt let us down
652667 it was a very emotional day for him and fully deserved
652668 i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
652669 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
652670 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
652671 we had a very young side especially in the first half and played well
652672 we were unlucky to concede the goal and maybe lacked a bit of experience to score as well as some physical match sharpness
652673 there were some heavy legs but it will get better over the next two weeks
652674 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have
652675 if we can find someone the we will do it if not i am happy as well
652676 do not form an impression on his small size because he is not phased by the physical challenges
652677 he really looks mature on the pitch but he is 16 and we have to respect his development
652678 however do not reproach me now about not playing english players
652679 what pleased me was our defence and we did a lot of things well
652680 however we took a lot of time to get into the game
652681 in the first half especially we looked tired and its not like weve played a lot of friendlies
652682 but we began to get more into it in the second half and we succeeded in doing well
652683 winning this competition doesnt interest me apart from the fact that its always nice to win something
652684 it would be nice to win for the fans but they know that were working to prepare ourselves well for a good season
652685 hes fantastic its as if hes always played with us
652686 hes everywhere even when we dont have the ball and his passing is brilliant it really seems as if hes been with us for years
652687 it was a difficult match where only one goal won it
652688 it was a very difficult match for us even though we are aware that we dominated
652689 but its the team of the highest level and we are already trying to work towards the preliminary round of the champions league
652690 tomorrow we have another difficult game and then we have another one against
652691 but these are matches that are at the highest level matches that the team need and matches that we need to win
652692 but i think we have a good team and that we have a great desire to win and that things are good all in all
652693 as soon as we heard of the interest in robbie those of us who know him wanted the deal to happen
652694 we know what he can add to the side and alongside fernando torres we feel weve a strikeforce to rival any in the premier league
652695 the same applies with robbie he probably should have been here five or six years earlier
652696 keane and torres showed good movement and linked well with gerrard yossi benayoun and dirk kuyt
652697 all five offensive players were very clever and showed a lot of quality
652698 they were asking to enter the state of israel after being threatened by hamas gunmen
652699 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
652700 there was a clue in dr williams second main address to all 670 bishops in canterbury he referred repeatedly to a focus on

652706 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
652707 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
652708 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
652709 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
652710 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
652711 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists

652741 in this issue you can read stories of local ordinary people who have been healed as a result of christian prayer
652742 i am a medical doctor with over 35 years experience more than 20 locally i have checked all the stories written here and can vouch that they are true
652743 we certainly didnt mean to mislead anyone dr matthias has been a doctor for 35 years thats who he was
652744 so in hindsight we should have said he was a retired medical doctor
652745 but the first more serious point is that we were irresponsible by suggesting that someone could come to church and benefit from prayer for healing

652747 we hope that catholics around the state will recognize the moral and civic duty they have as catholics and citizens to vote and to do so with a properly formed conscience
652748 if we as catholics want to effect change in our society and culture we must vote and encourage our friends and family to do the same
652749 the catholic church certainly understands and also believes in the separation of church and state
652750 but that doesnt mean we believe in the separation of faith and politics
652751 faith is what drives the thinking of catholics of christians in terms of their relationship with god and also in terms of their relationship with their neighbor
652752 because of that our political relationships which are about our relationship with our neighbor are informed by our faith so serious catholics whether politicians or ordinary voters have an obligation actually to make sure that faith informs their political decisions and their actions
652753 we catholics are not one issue voters but neither do we catholics believe that every issue is of the same moral weight or value
652754 all of the many issues and rights about which we are so rightfully concerned are grounded in that fundamental right which our declaration of independence calls unalienable and that is the right to life

652849 i have not played my very best when trying to get in on the last week or two
652850 i was hitting shots with too many goals in mind instead of just trying to hit it close to the hole or down the fairway or knock it in the hole i was trying to make the team with every shot it sounds absurd but in a way thats the way i was going about it
652851 its a great feeling to know im going to be on the team and not have to worry about it
652852 this time im thinking about it because it was my no 1 goal
652853 its on your mind but your golf will take care of itself if you dont play well you dont deserve to be on the team
652854 the pga championship is one of the four biggest tournaments of the year and the players need to prepare like they would any other week

652856 you try to pretend its not on your mind but its on your mind
652857 the only way to make the ryder cup team is having two good weeks and thats worry about the little stuff sticking to your routine making sure youre prepared its all in my hands
652858 i was trying to win to get all those points
652859 after i hit my first bad shot i didnt say hit it in the middle of the green and make 5 i was trying to win the golf tournament from 240 yards away
652860 ive really taken a lot of pressure off this ryder cup
652861 ive been down that road where you try so hard that it gets in the way im just going to play and if i make it it will be a great accomplishment

652864 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
652865 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
652866 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
652867 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
652868 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
652869 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
652870 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
652871 e non me la posso prendere per cos poco ho troppo altro a cui pensare
652872 its hard to stand out against those thats some pretty good competition but it doesnt make it any less
652873 its a major and its one id love to win
652874 its always gotten a bad rap but i still perceive it as one thats very important being the fourth one maybe guys build up a tolerance of the pressure and everything but again its a major a lot of guys get their first major win there so it provides a lot of hope for a lot of players
652875 ive got a newfound energy for the end of the season
652876 we were looking for something that said this is the seasons final major and your last shot at glory
652877 when you win a tournament on the tour you go into the record books when you win a major you go into the history books
652878 there were people who thought the association was wrong for giving up on match play
652879 but if you look back television was coming on and match play didnt lend itself to tv the other thing about match play is that golf was becoming more popular and with the gallery being so large you got to the semifinals and had 25 000 people trying to watch two matches
652880 you run the risk of not having tiger in the final
652881 and im not sure they got the attendance they hoped for
652882 if it turned out like this year everybody would love match play
652883 but if tiger and phil go out in the first two rounds everybody goes home imagine planning your whole year around watching tiger or phil play in the pga you get a saturday ticket and theyre already gone
652884 if you had to rank it the pga is probably fourth on everyones list
652885 but ask a player if he wants to win it and ill guarantee hell tell you yes when it comes to winning a major it really doesnt matter which one

652918 at times accrington were putting two players on him you can see he has ability but he needs to work on his fitness
652919 hes had a chance in the football league so maybe he can see this as a second chance for him and he can rebuild his career with barrow

652989 i thought our defense was excellent and on offense we seemed a little bit out of synch
652990 what im really pleased with is it didnt come easy offensively for us and it never had a negative impact on our defense and to me thats a really big thing
652991 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them
652992 the ball found me and i was able to make them pay in that kind of situation where the game is kind of see sawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron james it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear

652995 they are really wanting us to win they want us to move forward
652996 they truly want to be involved greg has been a great support hes been to a lot of our training camps over the past three years and mark has most recently got involved because hes back into coaching
652997 both of them have just given us words of wisdom and words of advice and said heres what it is and go do it
652998 i think we have done a better job now of preparing our men than we have in the past years so i think were going to be able to step it up

653011 petition for the determination of nonregulated status for herbicide tolerant 356043 soybean
653012 detailed compositional analyses of 356043 soybean have demonstrated that the composition of natural food and feed constituents of 356043 soybean is comparable and nutritionally equivalent to that of control soybean
653013 fig 15a shows that addition of salt 20 mm kcl to the assay buffer significantly increases the km value for glyphosate
653014 the average kcat km of the parental enzymes was 4 2 min 1 mm 1 and the average of the best round 7 variant was approximately 10 340 min 1 mm 1 figure 23 it was from this round that the gat4601 gene encoding the gat4601 protein was identified
653015 n acetylcysteine is a pharmacological agent used mainly as a mucolytic and in the management of paracetamol acetaminophen overdose
653016 the proteins gat4601 and gm hra expressed in 356043 soybean degrade rapidly under conditions used in the processing of soybean
653017 for many years it was believed that glyphosate is not metabolized by plants
653018 aminomethylphosphonate ampa a glyphosate analog lacking a carboxyl group was acetylated with nearly the same kcat value as glyphosate by the native r7 and r11 enzymes
653019 none of the amino acids antibiotics or nucleotides surveyed exhibited high catalytic efficiency with the native enzyme from which it was concluded that the physiological role of gat in b licheniformis is still unknown
653020 gat proteins are members of the gcn 5 related family of n acetyltransferases also known as the gnat family the gnat superfamily is one of the largest enzyme superfamilies recognized to date with over 10 000 representatives from plants animals and microbes
653021 knowing that yopj functions as an acetyltransferase is not the end of the story
653022 while the role of an acetylase as a virulence factor has been clearly defined it is just the beginning of understanding how widespread such factors are

653036 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
653037 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
653038 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level
653039 and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
653040 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the teams which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success

653059 we now expect overall visits to fall by 2 7 percent in 2008 and by 1 2 percent in 2009 visit spending is anticipated to grow by less than inflation in both years
653060 although strong visitor growth since 2005 does mean london is facing this slowdown from a position of relative strength there are significant risks that this slowdown could be more severe than predicted
653061 although some sectors of the visitor economy such as retail and theatre continue to report robust trade others such as hotels business venues and attractions are witnessing weakening trade soft future booking levels have also been widely reported

653064 in ireland terms theres no stand out number two behind ronan ogara so whoever emerges as ulsters out half will be well placed to challenge
653065 once ulster showed an interest it was an easy decision to make ive settled in well since coming back here
653066 training is very good and the squad looks in great shape
653067 the funny thing is that had i stayed at leicester things would have been different this season
653068 theres a new coach and number 10 andy goode has moved on but ive no regrets
653069 i had a really interesting meeting with him and i have to say i was very impressed
653070 he knew his rugby inside out and he was always trying out new ideas and certainly was never one for standing still
653071 hes a genuine running numb er 10 and has so much to offer a teams attacking philosophy can really only bear fruit if the number 10 is a running threat
653072 it will always be a regret that i qwasnt able to sign him up for lopndon irish
653073 what i especially like about him is that hes a nice blend of kicker and distributor
653074 then you look at some of the tries he has scored and you realise hes a special talent
653075 certainly the heineken draw offers us a real chance of getting out of our pool
653076 as for the magners league weve a number of home matches early in the competition and its important we capitalise
653077 were very organised and all the necessary strucures have been put in place
653078 everyone knows exactly whats required and the omens are looking good for the new season

653081 michael had always said he wanted to play for linfield and he thought a few things over during the week and decided that he would like to sign for the club
653082 were delighted to have him signed and in time for the season kicking off on saturday
653083 i was pleased with the first half we scored two good goals through glenn and william
653084 however we didnt look incisive at all after the break and i certainly reminded the players that we needed more after the match
653085 overall it was another good 90 minute workout for the players and i certainly feel were ready for the first game of the season on saturday
653086 we are fully focused and have our feet firmly on the ground
653087 we will not be getting carried away and will take one game at a time
653088 it was important for us to get the three points and we certainly did that in style
653089 the boys played extremely well and we scored some superb goals
653090 portadown should not be in this mickey mouse league which doesnt even have linesmen
653091 if portadown had not taken their foot off the pedal with 20 minutes left it could have been double figures
653092 however we will put this result behind us quickly and look forward to the clash with loughgall on tuesday night
653093 we want another win tomorrow and thats as far as were looking at this stage
653094 it was too close for comfort we got ourselves in a bit of a hole but i never thought we were in trouble and going into the last over needing less than 10 runs youre always in with a big shout
653095 both teams bowled well although we lost wickets at crucial times
653096 we needed only 30 at a run a ball but our depth in batting is one of our strenghts
653097 andre botha never lets you down hes in great nick with the bat
653098 people talk about mayo losing finals but you have to ask the question who else lost finals in the lastfour or five years the answer is not too many because they werent there
653099 the fact that mayo have been in finals and in thelatter stages of the league and the championship means they are a quality side
653100 we knew this was a difficult task and a step up from anything that we had faced to date this year it was always going to be a stiff challenge and when we wentthree points down midway through the second half the omens didnt look good
653101 however this team is made of better stuff people cast doubts on them and i can understand that because the results of the last three years dont merit any higher standing
653102 however i think they took back a bit of standing forthemselves today but weve only a week to enjoy it because it could all go out the window again next week
653103 were still not playing well and whoever gets us in the draw will be happy but were happy to cling on and hang in there and hopefully we can step it up
653104 coming off the back of the westmeath game it was always going to be a step up coming up to croke park to play mayo
653105 there is still a hunger in their team and it was a tough test only for an improved 15 minute spell we could be out of the all ireland
653106 results are results and were in the last eight and happy enough to be involved next weekend
653107 sometimes in changing rooms if things havent gone well you just want to pick up your bag and get out as quickly as possible
653108 after the kerry defeat last august we sat for 20 minutes nobody spoke or even moved
653109 we all knew our 2007 championship had run its course
653110 we also knew we had made a major effort and still lost
653111 any side can do without one or even two key players on any given day but if three or four go missing you are in big trouble
653112 well thats up to you i have no regrets and ive learnt a lot and im going on

653122 orang orang ketika itu bertanya kepada rasulullah saw tentang kebaikan sedangkan saya hudzaifah bertanya tentang keburukan karena takut keburukan itu akan kutemui maka saya bertanya wahai rasulullah sesungguhnya kami dulu dalam kejahiliyahan dan keburukan kemudian allah menunjukkan kami dengan kebaikan ini apakah setelah kebaikan ini ada keburu kan jawab rasulullah ya saya kembali bertanya dan apakah setelah keburukan ini ada lagi kebaikan rasulullah menjawab ya tetapi terdapat asap di dalamnya saya bertanya apakah kabutnya rasulullah menjawab kaum yang mencari petunjuk dengan selain petunjuk ku engkau mengenal kebaikan mereka dan mengingkari kejelekan mereka saya bertanya lagi apakah setelah kebaikan itu juga masih ada keburukan rasulullah menjawab ya yaitu para penyeru yang mengajak ke neraka jahannam barangsiapa yang memenuhi seruan mereka mereka akan menceburkannya ke neraka jahan nam saya berkata wahai rasullah tunjukkan sifat mereka kepada kami rasulullah bersabda mereka berkulit sama dengan kulit kita dan berbicara dengan bahasa kita saya bertanya apa yang engkau perintahkan padaku jika hal itu kutemui rasulullah menjawab berpeganglah pada jamaah umat islam serta pemimpin mereka saya bertanya lagi bila mereka tidak memiliki jamaah dan pemimpin bagaimana rasu lullah menjawab jauhilah semua kelompok tersebut sekali pun engkau harus menggigit akar pohon sehingga ajal menjem putmu sementara engkau pun tetap dalam keadaan seperti itu
653123 semua kewajiban yang tidak dapat terlaksana kecuali dengannya maka sesuatu tersebut hukumnya menjadi wajib
653124 dan hendaklah ada di antara kalian segolongan umat yang menyeru kepada kebaikan menyeru kepada yang makruf dan mencegah dari yang mungkar merekalah orang orang yang beruntung
653125 saya bertanya wahai rasulullah apakah yang engkau perintahkan padaku bika hal itu aku temukan rasulullah menjawab berpegangteguhlah pada jamaah kaum muslimin dan imam mereka
653126 saya bertanya bagaimana jika kaum muslimin tidak memiliki jamaah dan imam rasulullah menjawab jauhilah semua firqah tersebut sekalipun engkau harus menggigit akar pohon hingga ajal menjemputmu sedangkan dirimu tetap seperti itu

653138 after the pioneers came into the great salt lake valley they subsisted on native bonneville cutthroats which grew up to 40 pounds in utah lake this was during the 1850s when the pioneers were hard pressed for food so both the bonneville cutthroat and the california seagull played an important role in the preservation and subsistence of the mormon pioneers in the settlement of this state

653199 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
653200 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
653201 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
653202 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
653203 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
653204 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
653205 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
653206 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
653207 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
653208 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
653209 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
653210 regulatory expectations with appendix r paragraph iii g 2 operator manual actions
653211 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
653212 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
653213 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
653214 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
653215 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
653216 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
653217 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
653218 who are open to doing something on the production side
653219 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
653220 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
653221 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
653222 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
653223 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
653224 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
653225 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
653226 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
653227 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
653228 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
653229 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
653230 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
653231 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
653232 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
653233 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

653244 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
653245 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

653248 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
653249 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
653250 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
653251 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
653252 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
653253 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
653254 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
653255 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
653256 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
653257 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
653258 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
653259 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
653260 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
653261 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
653262 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
653263 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
653264 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
653265 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
653266 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
653267 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
653268 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
653269 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
653270 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
653271 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
653272 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
653273 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

653276 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
653277 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
653278 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
653279 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
653280 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
653281 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
653282 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
653283 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
653284 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
653285 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
653286 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
653287 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
653288 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
653289 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
653290 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
653291 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
653292 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
653293 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
653294 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
653295 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
653296 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
653297 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
653298 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
653299 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
653300 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
653301 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
653302 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

653324 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
653325 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
653326 while the company vows to carry on this certainly raises some questions about the likelihood of successful privatization of the space industry
653327 i consider demoflight 2 to be enough of a success given that it provides us the data to go operational to put my

653329 scrapbooking is a great way to relive a vacation or trip
653330 by going through the pictures and being creative to put it in a book you really have a chance to go back through that experience
653331 id take photos from trips or of family and instead of leaving them in a box or putting them in a photo album that could get sticky i started putting them in scrapbooks
653332 it ended up being better for the photos and it was just fun
653333 she has her own materials and sometimes shell come to me and say mom can we scrapbook sometimes i spend more time working with her on her projects than i do on mine
653334 its really inexpensive and it creates a way for hannah to make a lot of books
653335 when the last pirates of the caribbean movie came out hannah wanted to make a scrapbook for it
653336 so i stitched together some paper sacks helped her find some pictures of scenes from the movie online and she put it together it was a great project
653337 theyre a great way to remember relatives who may no longer be with us
653338 you dont even have to have a lot of photos just one or two or three could be enough and then use fabric or designs to decorate the pages like you remember a person its a great way to tell a story
653339 its something that will be around for a long time maybe even for great grandchildren to look at
653340 we have a lot of moms come in with their children
653341 its a hobby that is great for the kids to work on ive seen one mom come three times in the past week with her three teenage daughters i know theyre working on their own scrapbooks
653342 during the summer we have people from out of state come by to see what kinds of things we have to go in their vacation scrapbooks for this area
653343 fifteen or 20 years ago no one would have known what you were talking about if you mentioned scrapbooking
653344 but for the last 10 years its been really popular you mention scrapbooking now and everyone is doing it
653345 i started beading recently and its a lot of fun
653346 with weaving and beading there are motions you go through that are just soothing
653347 our guild has had some teenagers coming to recent meetings to knit
653348 its nice to see younger people getting involved in the hobby
653349 during the summer we have a lot of women who bring their daughters or granddaughters to the shop for classes
653350 i think during the summer people are looking for something for their kids to do besides stay at home watching the television or on the computer taking a class in quilting or knitting or sewing gives them the chance to learn something new
653351 that gives the children the opportunity to learn how to do something
653352 especially now when money is tight knowing how to make something with your hands can be a cheaper hobby and the kids enjoy it its fun
653353 scrapbooking can get expensive if you purchase a lot of pre made embellishments to add into the books but if you get creative by using scraps of fabric for designs its not that bad hannahs scrapbooks using the paper bags are really inexpensive
653354 i have had women come in and say my husband is complaining because i spent 50 on scrapbooking
653355 i always tell those women look at what youre doing with your 50 you arent using it to go out and play a game of golf or go deep sea fishing instead the way you spend your money will last for years and years to preserve memories his golf game will be forgotten soon after telling people that they see that the scrapbooks really are worth the cost its saving memories
653356 you have to plan out what youre going to make and not buy extra just to buy also the kinds of beads you buy can be more expensive than others
653357 andy instantly regretted his choice to hand out communion at church again he stood eyes closed tightly praying that it would all be over soon
653358 ew salt amp vinegar you said it was sour cream amp onion not cool man
653359 ich freue mich schon jetzt auf die n chsten skitouren man geht auf 2 000 oder 3 000 meter und begegnet vielleicht nur zwei oder drei menschen
653360 unsere erwartungen wurden sicherlich bertroffen die idee wird sehr gut angenommen
653361 die erwartungen sind von unserer seite her sicherlich bertroffen worden die idee wird von den leuten sehr gut angenommen und es sind auch die r ckmeldungen sehr positiv es hat am anfang sogar wartezeiten auf die karten gegeben wir haben n mlich mit zwei tickets pro gemeinde begonnen und haben dann nach bedarf auf bis zu sechs st ck aufgestockt
653362 i didnt grow up in the kind of environment that my characters grew up in or the kind of environment that i live in now
653363 it was one of the things that i always aspired to
653364 there are always going to be these categories that people will try to use to describe me but i should not be put into a box
653365 i would listen to their vernacular watch what they did
653366 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
653367 infelizmente ainda h machismo por mais que voc fa a um bom trabalho tenha atletas de destaque ainda v o te olhar diferente porque voc mulher diz rosane que est com a sele o de nata o em macau

653374 ill tell you one of the best moments of my police career was getting to personally tell sandra boss that weve recovered her daughter and she absolutely collapsed in my arms i caught her before she hit the ground
653375 her first words were that she was very happy to see very nice people
653376 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being at heart
653377 es bleibt noch ein rest an hoffnung dass sich diejenigen im inneriranischen machtstreit durchsetzen die die chancen erkennen die f r den iran in dem angebot liegen
653378 dass ahmadinedschad daran kein interesse hat war zu erwarten es kommt jetzt darauf an wie sich der geistige f hrer verh lt die chance dass es zu substanziellen verhandlungen kommt sollte der iran nicht leichtfertig verspielen das angebot ist f r den iran au erordentlich attraktiv und es w re fatal wenn die hardliner in teheran weiter die oberhand behielten
653379 after we turn it on you may hear a slight pop followed by some not unpleasant vibrations unless you are in switzerland in which case be sure you are wearing clean underwear
653380 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
653381 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
653382 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
653383 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
653384 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
653385 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
653386 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
653387 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
653388 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
653389 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
653390 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
653391 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
653392 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
653393 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
653394 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
653395 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
653396 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
653397 what could happen is that large amounts of water collect and cellars flood
653398 it happens a few times a year 80 100 mm per day is more extreme
653399 i carried both the living and the dead down from the mountain at one point i was terrified as a pakistani sherpa fell on my back with all his weight i was in a panic that he would drag all of us down with him and screamed for him to use his ice pick but he lost hold of it and flew off a 300 meter precipice
653400 we felt that this wouldnt turn out well and we retreated the accidents could have been prevented
653401 these mountains attract more and more inexperienced and na ve people who completely rely on the resources that are there sherpas oxygen gas and weather reports
653402 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
653403 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
653404 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
653405 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
653406 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
653407 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
653408 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
653409 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
653410 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
653411 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
653412 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
653413 i am fairly satisfied but there are like in any negotiations sticking points that need to be unraveled
653414 two weeks may appear too short but it is not inflexible and i am sure that the facilitation will adjust as progress moves forward
653415 we are not in these negotiations to have an elite pact by allocating this post or that position
653416 the country is on its knees our people have no food they have nothing and therefore in the spirit of trying to resolve the plight of our people we have put faith in the only solution where we dont have guns to fight
653417 that is our position and we are not moving from that position
653418 the will of the people must be respected and this is why we are saying the transitional government must be led by tsvangirai for a period which is not going to exceed two years and create an environment where a free and fair election is going to be held
653419 this situation is unacceptable and is putting thousands of innocent civilian lives including women and children at risk
653420 i therefore call upon the zimbabwean authorities to denounce and abandon violence and to provide unfettered humanitarian access
653421 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
653422 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
653423 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
653424 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
653425 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
653426 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
653427 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
653428 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
653429 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
653430 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
653431 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
653432 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
653433 i had one customer who wanted 14 cords of tree length wood
653434 peak buying is normally in march and april and this year the panic started in june
653435 this is a different dynamic and sellers werent ready they have a sort of rhythm and this year it just got blown out of the water
653436 theres no question this is going to be a hard winter for people because of the demand
653437 its not even a question of how much it costs for wood pellets or firewood so much as if theyre even available
653438 it was more just for the beauty of it and the atmosphere
653439 but this year im going to be much more diligent
653440 i think people who wait until september or october are going to have an unpleasant surprise
653441 if you had a primary source of heat and you were burning one cord of wood a winter it certainly would be advisable for a person like that to spend a little time and up that to two cords
653442 that i think is defensible from an economic standpoint and also an environmental standpoint
653443 the law says the emergency powers may be used if there is an imminent threat of serious violence or substantial damage to property or if a serious narcotics offence could be committed
653444 real hat ein angebot gemacht das der hsv nicht akzeptiert ich bleibe so lange kapit n des hsv bis etwas anderes passiert
653445 er ist momentan mental nicht zu 100 prozent da deshalb kann ich ihn nicht gebrauchen
653446 es w re besser wenn jetzt ruhe in die bude kommt der rummel um van der vaart in den letzten wochen hat uns nicht gutgetan
653447 f r mich ist es ein traum f r real madrid zu spielen im augenblick bin ich weiterhin spieler des hsv ich hoffe aber dass man rasch eine l sung findet und beide clubs sich einigen

653450 the third way works to build inclusive multiethnic societies based on common allegiance to democratic values
653451 embraces tolerant traditionalism honoring traditional moral and family values while resisting attempts to impose them on others
653452 it is kind of amazing that even though i try to only buy stuff when it is really necessary ive still managed to accumulate a lot of stuff
653453 and so i used the card and got the points and when the bill comes next week ill pay it in full
653454 all i have to do is fill up these 21 pages thats so easy
653455 after all some people say they can be a useful tool which can be overpowering if you dont know how to use it
653456 well i dont know if theyre a useful tool so much as a dangerous one i feel like im holding onto a chain saw for dear life and i forgot to read the manual my arms are shaking and i might drop it and cut off a finger any minute
653457 i am now debt free and i reflect on how i got there in this
653458 shows get better in their stride were getting better at californication
653459 according to vietnamese law glitter will be freed on august 19
653460 the decision on his release will be read before him that day it will be signed by the director of the prison
653461 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
653462 a successful design doesnt tell us how close to failure it might be
653463 typically the longer you go without a failure the more confident we become
653464 but theres then a seemingly unavoidable temptation to then start cutting corners
653465 that bridge was built deliberately as a slender aesthetically pleasing bridge
653466 and all the lessons from the 19th century that john roebling had laid out in the brooklyn bridge had been forgotten
653467 it has a lot of big cities but downtown is a lot like
653468 the kids loved having me there and so appreciative seeing them all smile is such an amazing
653469 they actually listen they are so excited at this novelty teacher
653470 its very rewarding i would suggest it to other people
653471 it is defiantly for people who want to go to other countries and challenge themselves without any formal training
653472 what does the theatre guild do lay it on me
653473 rhona how did you get involved in the theatre guild
653474 in 1997 i auditioned for the sound of music as one of the nuns the next play i was involved in was the visist by norm foster it is about a lawyer he is gay but his parents do not know he spends the play trying to tell them it was alot of fun i have been involved on and off the stage for over 10 years and now i am involved in public relations for the guild
653475 how can people from north bay and its surrounding area get involved

653483 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth

653541 every time i see phil oakey and the girls i start singing dont you want me
653542 thats a bit disrespectful to arctic monkeys because theyre really good but its a bit like being a professional cockney
653543 is where we got the idea of us as these technological beings
653544 i remember lying in bed with the windows open and hearing the steel forges going all night that continual industrial soundscape must have bled into our psyche
653545 there were lots of these small grubby industrial units dotted all around the city
653546 you could get rehearsal space for a fiver a week
653547 it was a load of people who didnt have much musical talent getting together and diy ing it all the way through
653548 according to oakey the leagues lack of musical prowess was a blessing
653549 so we constructed our records using synthesizers and computers we were the first programmed group
653550 much more aspirational there was a lot to escape from in the late 1970s and early 1980s it was grim
653551 we were influenced by krautrock giorgio moroders sequenced dance music disco glam anything but rock
653552 we saw it as our mission to get away from that
653553 our thrusting futurism was all about our desperation to get out of sheffield
653554 we were providing an optimistic example for our peers saying you can get out of this mire and that fitted with our anti hippie idea it was part of our mission to destroy rocknroll
653555 it was big choruses big hair big shoulder pads big everything
653556 but thats because our generation lacked self esteem we thought we were invisible thats why it was so peacock and loud but it was all home made it was all from jumble sales
653557 were not about having hits were about not having much money its raining most of the time someones got a studio so lets have a party

653600 and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was on his head his face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire and he had a little book open in his hand and he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he cried out seven thunders uttered their voices now when the seven thunders uttered their voices i was about to write but i heard a voice from heaven saying to me seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered and do not write them
653601 but you daniel shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase
653602 and the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are in it the earth and the things that are in it and the sea and the things that are in it that there should be delay no longer but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel when he is about to sound the mystery of god would be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets
653603 surely the lord god does nothing unless he reveals his secrets to his servants the prophets
653604 then the voice which i heard from heaven spoke to me again saying go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth and i went to the angel and said to him give me the little book and he said to me take it and eat it and it will make your stomach bitter but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth
653605 your words were found and i ate them and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart
653606 son of man eat what you find eat that scroll and so speak to the house of israel so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that scroll and he said to me son of man feed your belly and fill your stomach with this scroll that i give you so i ate it and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness
653607 and i took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth but when i had eaten it my stomach became bitter and he said to me you must prophesy again about many peoples nations tongues and kings

653772 someone who earns 50 to 60 percent of the median income can pretty much live anywhere in the city if voucher holders are concentrated on the southeast side that means theyre constricted in their ability to choose where to live

653791 we deny in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that bahais in iran have engaged in any subversive activity
653792 the bahai community is not involved in political affairs their only crime is the practice of their religion
653793 the seriousness of the allegations makes us fear for the lives of these seven individuals
653794 that is no secret the government knew perfectly well about the existence of this committee long before its members were arrested just as the government knows perfectly well that these people are not involved in any underhanded activity
653795 suggestions of collusion with the state of israel are categorically false and misleading the iranian authorities are playing on the fact that the bahai world administrative center is located in northern israel
653796 the iranian government completely ignores the well known historical fact that the bahai faith was centered in iran until 1853 when the authorities there banished the bahai prophet founder who was forced into exile and eventually imprisoned in acre on the mediterranean coast under the ottoman turkish regime that area happens to be in what is now israel

653813 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
653814 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
653815 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
653816 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
653817 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

653843 i just want you to know that i really appreciate the fact that you have merchandise in your store that represents children of all ethnicities i really appreciate that
653844 there is a stigma of celebrity and money alongside football these days which is different from when i first came into the team
653845 now you see players with nice cars and 18 year olds on good money
653846 but its down to the individual having the right attitude and application its not enough just to have the talent
653847 i have seen players with plenty of ability no shortage of that whatsoever but they didnt make it because they did not have enough hunger to sacrifice things in order to succeed
653848 i leave the real partying to the young lads they can handle it better
653849 i am sure paul will do well because he knows his stuff
653850 he has done things a different way to my other team mates he started right at the bottom and did brilliantly at macclesfield and mk dons
653851 some people would say that is the proper way of doing things he has proven himself now he just has to do it in the premier league
653852 he will get a lot of respect because he has done it all as a player
653853 but that only gets you so far because you have got to know your stuff
653854 if he has the same enthusiasm he had during his playing days i am sure he will do really well
653855 yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me
653856 for god has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
653857 yah sepertinya saya kurang beruntung karena nilai hanya terpaut 2 poin saja untuk third prize
653858 the longer i live the more i realize the impact of attitude on life attitude to me is more important than facts it is more important than the past than education than money than circumstances than failure than success than what other people think say or do it is the more important than appearance giftedness or skill it will make or break a company a church a home the remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day we cannot change our past we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way we cannot change the inevitable the only thing we can do is play on the one string we have and that is our attitude i am convinced that life is 10 what happens to me and 90 of how i react to it and so it is wit you we are in charge of our attitudes

653862 it is to formulate the platform that the democrats will use to go forward after the convention in denver and what they do is they get input on various issues from people across america

653893 the threat of large scale military actions between georgia and south ossetia is becoming more real
653894 the russian foreign ministry urges the sides to exercise maximum caution
653895 the use of force can finally ruin hopes for a settlement of the conflict

653904 it appears that the israeli education system has a lot more work to do
653905 climate change will have a big impact over the next five decades
653906 our woods will change many species will cope with some warming but there is uncertainty about what happens with extreme events such as droughts and storms which we expect to become more frequent
653907 the good news is well have winters like charleston south carolina
653908 the bad news is well have summers like phoenix but with humidity
653909 this issue and the reductions cut across every sector of the state whether its transportation or energy it affects everybody
653910 all of this has to be considered with all the stakeholders involved keeping in mind the national economy and the budgetary issues the state faces
653911 well have to make some decisions on how quickly we can move forward
653912 given what it takes to stabilize greenhouse gases time is of the essence
653913 most tidal wetlands would be lost about 200 square miles of land would be inundated
653914 summertime water temperatures are likely to be similar to those of the north carolina sounds by 2050

653931 we have a real deep rooted attachment to the properties
653932 under article 97 of the state constitution we are protected in our rights to use state resources
653933 i believe that it should be for everyones enjoyment and everyone should be responsible for protecting the beach and in turn we should be able to reap the benefits

653940 sometimes they dont understand that 45 minutes means 45 minutes
653941 some people believe that you can even see the ghost of marco polo wandering these streets
653942 the opportunity to wander a vast glacier frozen in time

653951 there was still a lot of challenging work involved especially with those extremely large boulders they required blasting
653952 fortunately everything went along real quickly the blasting work the final scaling of the rockface wall and they threw a lot of crews and equipment at it and it all fell into place
653953 staff are absolutely confident they would not have gone in to remove that debris if they hadnt been 100 per cent confident of the rock face
653954 that rock face along with other areas along the corridor will continue to be monitored now that a whole lot of that rock has been released it probably makes it a little bit more safer in a perfect world wed do it in a more controlled fashion but there was nothing to suggest that a slide of this magnitude was going to happen
653955 pakistan needs to get everybody lined up in the same direction if they are really going to tackle the terrorist problem
653956 our view is that it is important to have a good intelligence service in pakistan but it is also important for that intelligence service to work single mindedly with other institutions to tackle the terrorist issue that affects so many people in pakistan and its neighbourhood
653957 other account receivables totaling p1 310 868 802 01 as of dec 31 2007 remained uncollected for more than three years thus depriving the government of much needed funds for the bureaucracy
653958 these were prior years recommendations that were not implemented by the comelec providing for the recovery of the payment it made on contracts declared null and void
653959 for reasons not attributable to the contract itself or to the procurement process
653960 i was in business class and on a window my favorite seat on a plane and i noticed as we took off that the planes rate of climb was slow i could see the ground slowly drifting away and the sound of the jet engine was different
653961 since i understand how planes work i was concerned because our ascent was slow the other passengers were in their seats just relaxing reading
653962 we were supposed to leave at 1 30 p m sydney time we waited for 30 minutes we were not informed of what was happening finally there was an announcement that we could already board
653963 i felt that we were just circling i knew that based on the location of the oil tanker below i immediately thought there was a problem and that we were going around to dump fuel in preparation for landing
653964 when we landed i called the qantas official i just met and he was surprised i was aboard the flight
653965 thats the reason why im informing you to review your maintenance program
653966 in an environment where everybody is armed the breakout of violence is a possibility
653967 the mnlf and the milf are brothers we have the same ideologies and aspirations for the bangsamoro people were hoping that the government will find a certain mechanism to avoid conflict in territory
653968 unfortunately bringing peace to mindanao is very complex the important thing is the presidents determination to move the peace process forward
653969 mnlf lost commands and breakaway groups in pursuit of genuine peace in mindanao
653970 some even went with ji jemaah islamiyah and the abu sayyaf just because they were very disappointed
653971 we have been talking with our comrades to be patient and wait until the technical review of the tripartite peace agreement is finished
653972 but many of them especially the younger ones are getting restless we cannot control them anymore
653973 many of them are asking why are we still poor
653974 the government is moving so fast on signing agreements with sister organizations like the milf its not proper the 1996 mnlf grp accord should take precedence before any other agreements
653975 we are willing to support other agreements if it will not result in the ejection of the mnlf in the equation
653976 if that happens the bangsamoro people will be like palestine a nation without a state
653977 as such we should be consulted on the moa the existence of armm should be respected
653978 ich bin im sommer ausgebootet worden was soll ich da gro erwarten

653986 ja met de nadruk op lijkt inderdaad je voelt hier in brussel de paniek om zich heen slaan toch is er weinig meer aan te doen de regels waren op voorhand duidelijk er is geen clausule dat het verdrag toch kan doorgaan als slechts n lidstaat het verwerpt de omtrekkende bewegingen die balkenende maakt zijn dus nergens op gebaseerd het verdrag is verworpen punt
653987 dat zou betekenen dat europa zich volslagen ongeloofwaardig maakt niet alleen ten opzichte van de ierse bevolking stel je eens voor hoe wij ons zouden voelen als een nederlands nee zou worden genegeerd maar ook tegenover europa als geheel het zou zoiets betekenen als tijdens een wedstrijd de spelregels veranderen om je zin door te drijven het heeft er alle schijn van dat europa geen enkele rekening heeft gehouden met een eventuele afwijzing van het verdrag

654072 this is the moment when we must build on the wealth that open markets have created and share its benefits more equitably trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global development but we will not be able to sustain this growth if it favors the few and not the many
654073 americans still believe in an america where anythings possible they just dont think their leaders do
654074 issues are never simple one thing im proud of is that very rarely will you hear me simplify the issues
654075 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment this is our time
654076 a government that robs peter to pay paul can always depend on the support of paul
654077 this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
654078 well its true that most of the students are white but we do have some diversity our school has plenty of orientals
654079 if you dont mind me asking how many asians would you say there are in each grade level
654080 there are about 35 students in each grade level and probably two orientals in each grade some grades might have as many as three
654081 one of the things i love about the school is how they expose the kids to different cultures my son learned about kuonzie im fairly certain that she meant kwanzaa but it came out phonetically as koo on zee and my other son did a special project for chinese new year
654082 great news everyone i just recruited two more orientals for our kids to be around
654083 youre not oriental carpets are oriental you and my girls are asian chinese
654084 sometimes it makes me wonder for every person that has told me that im making too big of deal of race in the classroom and that it shouldnt matter if more than 90 of the student body is white would those same people be willing to send their kids to a school where more than 90 of the student body identifies as non white what about even 50
654085 i have a black a woman two jews and a cripple and we have talent
654086 who knew that my family would have to deal with racism in this day in age thank goodness my child was too young to understand what that ignorant person was saying i cant imagine if she was actually old enough to realize what was being said hopefully shell never have to hear words like that again i just want her to stay innocent forever why do people have to be so mean i never dreamt that wed encounter anything other than positive experiences from being a transracial family i sure do hope and pray that this is our first and last incident with such ignorant people
654087 mom dad i am going to be like martin luther king when i grow up
654088 issues pertaining to race doesnt matter to me or affect me because im white
654089 so its not just me whos noticing this color stuff
654090 we have to be receptive and proactive no matter what color our children are
654091 if a white person claims there is no such thing as white privilege and everyone around him agrees that he speaks the truth does it mean that white privilege does not exist
654092 you know i respect what youre saying and i can see how you would interpret the concept of white privilege in the manner you described but i have to say i completely disagree as a white man in this country today i feel that im the least protected and have access to the least amount of privileges and advantages available especially in the workplace with all of the hype over embracing diversity and being ultra pc i can guarantee you that every white colleague of mine would agree with me on this we know that wed be the first in line to get fired because everyone knows you wouldnt be able to fire a person of color without getting sued people see what they want to see what people dont realize now is that as a white male in this country today i am the least protected by any kind of special privileges or benefits
654093 i dont need to worry discuss be concerned be educated about race because i am white i just concern myself with one race the human race
654094 nothing more than a vast left wing conspiracy theory against the white man
654095 every white man woman child who was killed or maimed by a minority deserved their fate because of years of white oppresion that still goes on
654096 hey twinkie you think youre so much better than the rest of us by sucking him off
654097 what tangible measures can i take right now to make sure my child feels most like him or herself
654098 perhaps its just me but as a parent of a biracial daughter and an asian son its far from my dream as their mother to have either of them enter into their adulthood thinking believing announcing and celebrating that they are white or have our daughter claiming a white only status
654099 what tangible measures can i take right now to make sure my child feels most like him or herself
654100 adoption its not just for infertiles anymore just ask angelina
654101 while i might not always feel comfortable reading your blog i think thats a good thing when i first designed the shirt i hadnt yet thought of how my child might see it one day at that point i hadnt fully processed the necessary tragedy that would occur for me to have a chance at this joy
654102 all 3 of these kids here with me are children who are a part of our family
654103 poor family on the other side of the world lost a child to a wealthier middle class couple
654104 i think as part of homestudies ap should conduct a research project on adoption from the childs perspectives research what is written on transracial adoption
654105 im so sorry that you had to be adopted into our family
654106 mommy why cant my korean mommy be with me too
654107 doesnt my korean mommy love me did i do something to make her leave why couldnt she keep me
654108 dont worry about that sweetie what matters now is that your with your forever family
654109 lets just focus on the fact that youre here with us now right where you should be
654110 dont concern yourself with the past just remember how much we love you and how we were meant to be together
654111 if you cant think of only positive things about your adoption then dont think anything at all
654112 i am sorry we do not know where you mother is in guatemala
654113 its okay paula its perfectly natural to feel that you need to have a sense of control over things your need to exert your own level of control and authority in a situation is understandable your beginnings are rooted in the unknown and that can feel scary it must have been so frightening confusing and alarming to have been separated from your korean parents with seemingly no notice whatsoever and not know why to wonder when they were coming back only to realize that theyre not and never will the same goes for your foster parents and for the escort on the plane its not your fault that you dont trust yourself well enough yet to know that you dont need to create situations where you feel that youll have some modicum of control even if just for the simple reason to know that you exist and that you do matter it will get better i promise just dont be too hard on yourself
654114 well i didnt have control over anything in the first place so why try now
654115 i need everything in my life to be in order and controllable or ill panick
654116 can i have a drink of water can i have another tissue can i have one more hug and a kiss
654117 you read her a story you spent time cuddling her for goodness sakes shes sleeping in your bed with you and dad i mean she has everything so why is she screaming like that
654118 it can never be enough you can never do enough you do everything for her and its never enough
654119 you can never make her stop worrying that youll go no matter what you do shes afraid youll go if she trusted you she wouldnt be screaming shed be happy and feel safe like our friends new baby does you can never give her what her first mom took away
654120 if i close my eyes when i awake everything will be different
654121 are you sure youre able to see anything out of those things
654122 shes a plateau alright and not just in the face
654123 what is she talking about my korean chinese vietnamese child
654124 i am a korean american woman and i am proud of who i am i am proud of what i look like and i am proud of where i came from
654125 i know why you adopted her because she looks like me
654126 it has to be praying on their conscience at this stage after being involved in a hit and run which has resulted in the death of an elderly man
654127 i would appeal to that person he or she to come forward
654128 in ireland terms theres no stand out number two behind ronan ogara so whoever emerges as ulsters out half will be well placed to challenge
654129 once ulster showed an interest it was an easy decision to make ive settled in well since coming back here
654130 training is very good and the squad looks in great shape
654131 the funny thing is that had i stayed at leicester things would have been different this season
654132 theres a new coach and number 10 andy goode has moved on but ive no regrets
654133 i had a really interesting meeting with him and i have to say i was very impressed
654134 he knew his rugby inside out and he was always trying out new ideas and certainly was never one for standing still
654135 hes a genuine running numb er 10 and has so much to offer a teams attacking philosophy can really only bear fruit if the number 10 is a running threat
654136 it will always be a regret that i qwasnt able to sign him up for lopndon irish
654137 what i especially like about him is that hes a nice blend of kicker and distributor
654138 then you look at some of the tries he has scored and you realise hes a special talent
654139 certainly the heineken draw offers us a real chance of getting out of our pool
654140 as for the magners league weve a number of home matches early in the competition and its important we capitalise
654141 were very organised and all the necessary strucures have been put in place
654142 everyone knows exactly whats required and the omens are looking good for the new season
654143 we want another win tomorrow and thats as far as were looking at this stage
654144 it was too close for comfort we got ourselves in a bit of a hole but i never thought we were in trouble and going into the last over needing less than 10 runs youre always in with a big shout
654145 both teams bowled well although we lost wickets at crucial times
654146 we needed only 30 at a run a ball but our depth in batting is one of our strenghts
654147 andre botha never lets you down hes in great nick with the bat
654148 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
654149 not farah fawcet style more like a cassidy style or a shorter valerie bertinelli style
654150 teach us to number our days and recognize how few they are help us spend them as we should

654194 such a defeat would be a huge blow to the aspirations of the progressive and moderate element in our country it goes without saying of course that labour mps would also enjoy the benefit of free vote
654195 therefore if the prime minister agrees to allow nationalist mps to vote according to their individual conscience i would after considering the individual views of all mps who are in favour of the introduction of divorce and seeking the opinion of moderate citizens outside of parliament consider moving a private members bill during this legislature
654196 for the first time the leader of one of the two major parties is not only in favour of divorce but is also stating that he is ready to move legislation on the subject
654197 on the other hand we have a conservative prime minister who back in 1998 went on record as saying that divorce is no solution but is now saying that there should be a debate in cabinet
654198 i believe that this is also the opinion of progressives and moderates in this country inside and outside the labour party
654199 calling a referendum would simply amount to passing the buck it would be an irresponsible failure to postpone the decisions that need to be taken
654200 although divorce does not form part of the pns electoral programme public debate on the issue has re emerged and is setting a pace in this scenario the pn will participate in the debate keeping in context the relevant needs of the family and its children within a changing society according to the values it upholds and beyond emotions and political partisanship with full respect to different ideas and opinions on the matter

654209 non voglio niente grazie oddio ma guarda che razza di vestito assurdo
654210 ma se mi fa le tette ancora pi giganti mi imbarazza
654211 ma io sono calmissima solo che questo sogno mi fa strano io sono troppo lucida e tu
654212 beh anche tu sei troppo lucido e morto tanto per iniziare
654213 come posso essere morto se sono qui con te ora

654230 antes de decidir me gustar a saber la opini n de mam
654231 that the global ocean has lost more than 90 of large predatory fishes
654232 the genetic species habitat and ecosystem diversity of the oceans is believed to exceed that of any other earth system
654233 throughout the worlds oceans food fishes once believed to be immeasurable in number are now recognized as greatly depleted and in some cases almost extinct a million vessels now fish the worlds oceans twice as many as there were twenty five years ago are there twice as many fish as before hardly
654234 freezing cod also changed the relationship of seafood companies to fishing ports frozen fish could be bought anywhere wherever the fish was cheapest and most plentiful with expanding markets local fleets could not keep up with the needs of the companies
654235 to three quarters of a ton and having a length of four meters
654236 the magnitude of the fishing harvest and the examples of major alterations to marine food webs by predator removal suggest that effects of fishing are ecologically substantial at large spatial scales
654237 overfishing and ecological extinction predate and precondition modern ecological investigations and the collapse of marine ecosystems in recent times raising the possibility that many more marine ecosystems may be vulnerable to collapse in the near future
654238 the use of antibiotics in salmon farming has been prevalent right from the beginning and their use in aquaculture globally has grown to such an extent that resistance is now threatening human health as well as other marine species
654239 the coastal and marine support areas needed for resource inputs and waste assimilation is
654240 short of human extinction there is no sense in which capitalism can be relied upon to permanently break down under the weight of its depletion and degradation of natural wealth
654241 time is everything man is nothing he is at the most times carcase
654242 its clear somebody has to win and somebody has to lose
654243 its not pretty at all because people say oh my god look how much money these guys are making while people are losing their homes and are complaining about the cost of eggs and sugar but so what we dont live in a society that is pretty all the time thats why its capitalism

654249 climate change will have a big impact over the next five decades
654250 our woods will change many species will cope with some warming but there is uncertainty about what happens with extreme events such as droughts and storms which we expect to become more frequent
654251 there is a serious and dramatic decline in marine resources
654252 it got that way because theres a lack of understanding of the interconnectedness of those resources and how they depend on each other
654253 the public in general is not aware of the plight of the ocean
654254 we need to present the information and make them aware of it
654255 the good news is well have winters like charleston south carolina
654256 the bad news is well have summers like phoenix but with humidity
654257 this issue and the reductions cut across every sector of the state whether its transportation or energy it affects everybody
654258 all of this has to be considered with all the stakeholders involved keeping in mind the national economy and the budgetary issues the state faces
654259 well have to make some decisions on how quickly we can move forward
654260 given what it takes to stabilize greenhouse gases time is of the essence
654261 most tidal wetlands would be lost about 200 square miles of land would be inundated
654262 summertime water temperatures are likely to be similar to those of the north carolina sounds by 2050

654271 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave and the only reporter in that area who is black
654272 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
654273 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
654274 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
654275 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
654276 use d drugs to help turn brain cells from an adult back into embryo like stem cells
654277 without destroying human embryos this week we also learned that by using this new stem cell reprogramming technique supported by president bush when the congress refused to go along
654278 have established a human cell based system for studying sickle cell anemia by reprogramming somatic body cells to an embryonic stem cell like state
654279 this is precisely the kind of experiment for which we were told that cloning was required
654280 individuals have a right to make up their own minds in personal matters but this party also believes that we ought to significantly reduce the number of abortions in this country
654281 state laws restricting the use of medicaid funds in paying for abortions reduced the abortion rate by 29 66
654282 if the guttmacher institute has said it would im not going to argue with the guttmacher institute but i can tell you as the governor of one of the four states which provides public funding i find that hard to believe because our rate is not higher than the rate of corresponding states nearby
654283 president bush has again refused to direct taxpayer funds to a united nations agency accused of promoting abortion and backing the one child forced abortion policy in china bush revoked funding for the un population fund unfpa for the seventh consecutive year the white house is withholding almost 40 million in funding from the un agency because the state department has determined that it has violated the kemp kasten amendment of 1985
654284 pro life law that ensures no public funds can go to groups that promote forced abortions overseas
654285 this program will go down in history as one of the greatest abuses of human rights in the 20th century
654286 none of the funds made available in this act nor any unobligated balances from prior appropriations may be made available to any organization or program which as determined by the president supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization
654287 is having an unplanned birth worse for teens than abortion
654288 previous studies have found that younger abortion patients may be more likely to experience difficulties coping after abortion compared to older women
654289 when women feel forced into abortion by others or by life circumstances negative post abortion outcomes become more common
654290 adolescents are generally much less prepared to assume the responsibility of parenthood and are therefore the recipients of pressure to abort
654291 the risks of terminating seem to be even more pronounced

654297 with the stroke of a pen struck away the hopes and dreams
654298 its a shame bush is kow towing to a very small group instead of doing whats best for the american people suffering from chronic ailments
654299 we are deeply saddened that once again the hope for so many americans who suffer with incurable conditions has been shattered

654344 husains laundry was in a dryer and her car keys were nearby on a washing machine
654345 this did not appear to be a robbery because we found all of the personal effects that we expected to find with her body since this happened 16 years ago it seems unlikely this could have been a hate crime against a muslim person
654346 i believe this to be a crime of opportunity this case still bothers everyone who worked on it even now to this day i still have a photo of norasaadah on my computer
654347 she was a 30 year old doctoral student from malaysia pursuing a degree in food science
654348 she was very personable spoke english well and was not what i would consider a shy person
654349 her area of study was tea i remember how she and another student traveled with my family to charleston to visit a tea plantation it was a relaxed and interesting trip for everyone i was shocked to hear that she had been murdered
654350 we depend on citizen input with a case like this one
654351 someone knows something that will help solve this murder someone may have seen something at the time that will be the missing puzzle piece that we need because we never close a case like this one until it is solved
654352 were kind of short of young people so would you and your children mind joining us for the trivia game you can be on team volturi
654353 now save this kiddies because at midnight were gonna have a drawing for a free copy of the new book
654354 i would have played for my country if my country needed me
654355 it was sort of a joke at first then dirk talked to me about my family being from germany a german federation guy got involved and it turned into this im going to the olympics
654356 i look at this as a great opportunity to live a dream
654357 i play basketball and im getting this chance to be part of the olympics its about the basketball for me not politics not anything else i was going to play basketball this summer and this seems like a great way to do it
654358 people calling me traitor on the radio and stuff i dont understand that its basketball i love my country
654359 its scary that people get so carried away with politics when its supposed to be about the sports
654360 i understand that but i could get hurt in the summer league or just about doing anything
654361 after that last game in greece he sat on the floor just crying he thanked me for helping
654362 i mean i felt great for him he has been trying to do this for 12 years and i had been there for 12 days it means so much to him
654363 i gave my word to dirk to the german officials
654364 and i knew i wouldnt be going to the olympics with the u s team
654365 i would do my best to help my team win because its basketball and thats what you do
654366 a couple of the games have been strange especially with the officials calling things and the ball being slippery but you live and you learn
654367 a pick and roll is still a pick and roll and a post up is still a post up
654368 besides on this team you can go to dirk hes one of the best players in the world and hes just been unstoppable
654369 it reminds me of playing at central michigan where everybody was like a family and you hung out and stuff
654370 im not worrying about it now because i cant control it
654371 it sounds like we will have different guys i know i just want to win i hope we have guys who want to win thats what basketball should be about
654372 he wants to show some of the other athletes what it is because he is telling them what it has done for him
654373 thats what we believe and we find comfort in that even when we hear the criticism
654374 i love building lego mechanisms because the inherent limitations and versatility of the medium offer unique design challenges
654375 additionally since lego bricks are infinitely reusable i can build and test prototypes much faster than i could in other mediums im excited to take my experiments to a new level ive never tried to build a robot that could function under these conditions and function right the very first time 100 000 feet above ground is no place for a mistake
654376 i mentioned this earlier i want to tell you that you know i know its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money thats going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there that has been a top priority for us
654377 the early education plan will be paid for by delaying the nasa constellation program for five years using purchase cards and the negotiating power of the government to reduce costs of standardized procurement auctioning surplus federal property and reducing the erroneous payments identified by the government accountability office and closing the ceo pay deductibility loophole the rest of the plan will be funded using a small portion of the savings associated with fighting the war in iraq

654390 how changes to beliefs about climate change occur when consumers read information supplied by the news media
654391 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth

654400 just like in the film we were treated badly by the government but were supported by people in the community
654401 many catholics have gone beyond offering food and clothing to asylum seekers and become advocates of compassionate and just treatment of those who come to our shores
654402 we continue to be inspired by the courage of asylum seekers and the good people who walk in solidarity with them whether it is in america or in our own land
654403 we strongly encourage parishes and schools to get a copy of the film and to use it as a powerful tool to educate people about the meaning of christian solidarity

654416 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
654417 this is the message we have heard from him and declare to you god is light in him there is no darkness at all if we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness we lie and do not live by the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son purifies us from all sin
654418 total and collegial commitment to the solemn vocation of the global south
654419 global south anglican theological formation and education task force anglican catechism in outline a common home between us
654420 to work with those aspects of the conferences agenda that relate to implementing the recommendations of windsor including the development of a covenant
654421 the pastoral forum should be empowered to act in the anglican communion in a rapid manner to emerging threats to its life especially through the ministry of its chair who should work alongside the archbishop of canterbury in the exercise of his ministry the forum would be responsible for addressing those anomalies of pastoral care arising in the communion against the recommendations of the windsor report it could also offer guidance on what response and any diminished standing within the communion might be appropriate where any of the three moratoria are broken
654422 if you have any encouragement from being united with christ if any comfort from his love if any fellowship with the spirit if any tenderness and compassion then make my joy complete by being like minded having the same love being one in spirit and purpose

654439 en nuestras sociedades pareciera ser que el hombre genera o dispone de m s tiempo para realizar actividades que lo distiendan como por ejemplo las relacionadas con el contacto con la naturaleza o con la reuni n con sus amigos
654440 mientras los hombres generan sus momentos para desconectarse de las obligaciones a lo largo de su vida las mujeres tienen etapas hasta los 25 a os realizan mucha actividad social despu s se casan y hasta que los hijos se independizan prefieren dedicar el tiempo libre al cuidado de los menores
654441 tengo que dividir mis d as entre el estudio y el trabajo por eso el resto del tiempo tengo que destinarlo al cuidado del hogar
654442 las obligaciones de las mujeres cambiaron mucho en los ltimos tiempos no s si son tan compartidas con los hombres como se dice los roles de mujeres y hombres siguen siendo muy diferenciados
654443 las mujeres siguen conservando una fuerte carga dom stica y los hombres tienen menos exigencias tambi n hay un componente muy importante que depende de la inserci n en el mercado laboral ese es un mbito en el que se sigue privilegiando a los varones y como ellos disfrutan de m s tiempo libre pueden diversificar m s los programas del fin de semana

654470 llegar a una ciudad haciendo lobby para obtener excepciones no es de pionero ni de buen ciudadano ni de buen vecino
654471 cu l ser a la l gica de dar m s importancia a una sociedad an nima identificada con un inversor extranjero que a las miles de familias tandilenses con nombre y apellido que sostenemos con trabajo e impuestos esta ciudad e invertimos lo que tenemos todos los d as en tandil
654472 ser a injusto tener un plan de ordenamiento que s lo se les exija a algunos ciudadanos la ley por ser ley implica igualdad la excepci n no s lo es una pr ctica que debi ramos repensar puesto que incentiva el intercambio de favores sino que aumenta la discrecionalidad de las autoridades de turno y lo que autorizan dura en la ciudad por d cadas a veces para siempre quienes autorizan las excepciones o le buscan la vuelta s lo pasan por la gesti n algunos a os al cabo de los cuales ni siquiera recordamos quienes fueron responsables qui nes aprobaron el silo de chapa qui nes aprobaron las torres de falucho qui nes tiraron el molino de fugl qui nes han sostenido la continuidad de las canteras qui nes hicieron las construcciones que coronan las sierras y han logrado estropear el paisaje con su l gica de reyes los gobernantes pasan lo que deciden queda en la ciudad de todos por eso el ordenamiento territorial es una cuesti n de todos no debe expresar la voluntad de los funcionarios sino la vocaci n de la ciudad es el marco general imprescindible para la convivencia que define donde podemos realizar las actividades que queremos hacer
654473 de tal manera agrega tanto quien pida como quien autorice excepciones a ese marco general estar n estableciendo privilegios la construcci n en villa del lago y o la transformaci n de la posada de los p jaros en un emprendimiento con m s construcciones y funciones impropias del rea serrana son una amenaza para las sierras y tambi n para la equidad que se debe a todos los ciudadanos hablar de reas protegidas al mismo tiempo que aceptar excepciones que contradicen los objetivos de esa protecci n es al menos incoherente
654474 en tandil hay muchos lugares apropiados para construir si alguien quiere invertir tiene muchas cosas buenas para hacer respetando a la ciudad por ejemplo un centro de convenciones en un lugar adecuado sin destruir el patrimonio de todos seguramente quienes concurran a esas convenciones disfrutar n de venir a una ciudad que sea capaz de proteger de verdad las sierras m s antiguas de la argentina estableci ndolas como aut nticas reas protegidas
654475 un secretario de comercio no define cambios per s me parece un an lisis un poco reduccionista hay que ver si cada funcionario se desempa a honestamente seg n las rdenes que emanan de la presidencia
654476 m s all de la valoraci n que se ha hecho medi ticamente estamos frente a una cuesti n de l gica econ mica el tema del indec fue manejado pol ticamente o medi ticamente
654477 el tema de los superpoderes es un tema absolutamente superado por la modificaci n de la legislaci n el ltimo a o y porque el parlamento mantiene los controles sobre las modificaciones presupuestarias
654478 no creo que nadie lo haya atacado as que no tengo porqu defenderlo
654479 ustedes se preguntan si volver a a impulsar la resoluci n 125 y yo dir a que s porque por primera vez desde el advenimiento de la democracia las instituciones hemos discutido en serio con la posibilidad de ser sancionada una ley que tocaba la redistribuci n del ingreso en la argentina
654480 la autocr tica que deber a hacerme es cierto grado de ingenuidad frente a la reacci n de sectores muy poderosos econ micamente
654481 los comentarios eran exactamente los mismos pero al rev s
654482 en 2003 kirchner era un pusil nime que iba a ser manejado por esta presidenta kirchner era desconocido ac en buenos aires y yo muy conocida ahora se dio como una inversi n la d bil manejable y pusil nime soy yo y la verdad es que ninguna de esas dos afirmaciones es real
654483 hemos mantenido multiples reuniones el aspecto que falta abordar es el de la tecnolog a si uno analiza la actual ley que fue sancionada por la dictadura ve que en ese momento lo m s moderno que hab a era la tv a color por eso hay que preprarar el marco regulatorio para incorporar las nuevas tecnolog as
654484 todo con un an lisis que tiene que ver con un costado fiscal porque tiene que haber recursos para ser pagada si no se convierte en un discurso demag gico
654485 cada uno es responsable de las decisiones pol ticas que realiza
654486 no me corresponde a m adjetivar ni realizar ning n comentario sobre la actitud del vicepresidente son roles perfectamente delimitados creo que esta es la clave de la buena calidad institucional
654487 si pudiera manejar la moneda argentina no estar a ac en olivos todos conocen la autonom a del banco central que otorga solidez en materia financiera en un mundo de tanta turbulencia es un r gimen administrado por el banco central y no hay un tipo de cambio presidencial
654488 el sistema ferroviario argentino hab a sido devastado estamos haciendo una gran inversi n en materia ferroviaria tambi n es cierto que el precio de la tarifa es poco m s de un peso para tramos largos y esto requiere subsidios muy fuertes por parte del gobierno
654489 que esto quede claro no se saca un solo centavo del presupuesto nacional para estre tren sino que es financiado ntegramente por la empresa que lo construye
654490 la argentina es mirada en el mundo como ejemplo por el respeto a los derechos humanos por el juicio y castigo a quienes participaron de cr menes de lesa humanidad estamos cumpliendo con una deuda es un compromiso que excede las ideolog as
654491 nunca segu con tanto inter s una elecci n presidencial como la actual de los estados unidos ser en noviembre que obama un hombre de color quien me sorprendi por su personalidad su discurso y su enfoque sea candidato revela una apertura ideol gica
654492 la argentina se va a recuperar con el campo nunca sin el campo y menos en contra del campo

654497 niega la realidad por lo que es imposible resolver los problemas
654498 su actitud arrogante no es propia de un cuadro pol tico sino de alguien que no alcanza a percibir las preocupaciones de la gente
654499 est bien que acceda a la conferencia de prensa pero eso no deber a ser una excepci n sino una pr ctica democr tica corriente
654500 no hizo menci n ni a los cambios de funcionarios como guillermo moreno
654501 lamentablemente no se refiri o lo hizo someramente acerca de temas muy importantes como la inflaci n la grave situaci n por la que atraviesa la provincia de c rdoba los discursos del campo en la rural o la realidad de aerol neas argentinas
654502 me llam poderosamente la atenci n que nadie preguntara o que la presidenta omitiera hablar sobre el acto en la rural no se hizo una sola menci n al discurso de luciano miguens que fue contundente y que merec a al menos una menci n o consulta sobre que opinaba la presidenta
654503 creo que la conferencia la arm la presidenta para arrebatarle la tapa de los diarios al campo no fue seria no tuvo definiciones y es grave que haya ratificado que no va a haber cambios en su gabinete y en su pol tica de gobierno
654504 la nica salida es m s congreso libre y mayor justicia independiente tras cuatro meses de una absurda crisis provocada por la tozudez del gobierno y frente las respuestas negadoras de la presidenta
654505 pens bamos que era n stor kirchner pero no son los dos
654506 la soberbia y las decisiones caprichosas solo nos mantendr n como pa s al margen de las posibilidades que el mundo nos ofrece hoy
654507 le resulta imposible plantear los actos de gobierno hacia el futuro
654508 sobre la soluci n de los verdaderos problemas de la gente como inflaci n inseguridad y la energ a no emite palabra
654509 decir que guillermo moreno es honesto y correcto es realmente burlarse del pa s que todos los d as sufre la inflaci n y ve las mentiras y las patotas en el indec

654540 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
654541 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
654542 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
654543 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
654544 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
654545 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
654546 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
654547 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
654548 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
654549 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
654550 to check each one of them would take you several months
654551 i think it really woke people up and galvanized them
654552 there was no way i could have done it by myself absolutely not
654553 ive proven that i can beat the person i just cant beat the system
654554 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
654555 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
654556 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
654557 i do believe that his goals and his priorities and the visibility that hes given the issue has been good for america and the world
654558 it drives the talk radio crowd nuts when mccain does not wage war on pelosi and gore

654575 porque el blog es un recurso que permite el debate y el an lisis y eso es perfecto para esta asignatura
654576 por los que todos los docentes deber an utilizar un blog
654577 yo trato de que mi p gina sea una extensi n de mi asignatura antes la clase se limitaba al aula pero internet permite una comunicaci n constante con los estudiantes
654578 el blog modifica por completo la forma de trabajar de los alumnos que es mucho m s agradable y se convierte en un trabajo continuo y no de ltima hora porque se aprende haciendo
654579 yo el blog lo utilizo tanto en el aula para acceder a recursos como fuera de ella para proponer tareas a los estudiantes y recibir sus aportaciones
654580 por qu los profesores deber an hacer uso de los blogs
654581 por qu no hacerlo cuando las formas de comunicarse de los alumnos a diario son esas
654582 lo sencillo que es escribir y publicar informaci n de inter s para los estudiantes en un blog
654583 si hace unos a os hacer una p gina web era cosa de gur s ahora es algo que puede hacer todo el mundo

654598 ich w re bei meiner letzten rallye gern ins ziel gekommen aber wir sind in finnland und da kann es jeden erwischen
654599 bei dem unfall sind wir in den graben geraten und haben mit der beifahrerseite einen felsen gerammt ich konnte h ren dass jose danach richtiggehend au er atem war aber er gab mir zeichen die pr fung zu ende zu fahren die schmerzen wurden aber schlimmer und es w re f r jose zu viel gewesen wenn wir weitergefahren w ren davor war die rallye gut f r uns wir h tten nicht erwartet so schnelle zeiten fahren zu k nnen und alles schien unter kontrolle zu sein
654600 wir sind in den graben gerutscht und haben uns ganz langsam berschlagen
654601 wir sind in den graben gerutscht und haben uns ganz langsam berschlagen das auto war nicht besonders besch digt aber hat sofort angefangen zu brennen das ist schade da wir gut unterwegs waren wir uns schnell an diese high speed pisten gew hnt hatten und ich seit jahren keinen unfall mehr hatte
654602 wenn ich auf meine karriere zur ckblicke dann ist finnland nach meinem heimlauf in argentinien meine lieblingsrallye argentinien ist wegen der heimischen fans etwas besonderes jose und ich m ssen uns einfach f r die viele unterst tzung in den vergangenen jahren bedanken
654603 ich kann sagen dass ich sie wirklich alle sehr vermissen werde
654604 wo ich mir mit matthew wilson einen hei en fight um platz vier geliefert habe ich konnte richtig pushen und an meine grenzen gehen ohne irgendwelche fehler zu machen das war wirklich mein bestes ergebnis
654605 zun chst m chte ich meinem team ein gro es dankesch n aussprechen sie haben meinen wagen optimal vorbereitet und mir damit diesen zweiten saisonsieg erm glicht in der j ngsten vergangenheit hatten wir keine wirklich guten resultate eingefahren umso gl cklicher macht mich dieser sieg ich habe heute das optimum herausgeholt und keine fehler gemacht bereits am start bin ich sehr gut weggekommen und brachte danach den sieg nachhause
654606 ich bin mit dem heutigen rennen zufrieden leider habe ich einen schlechten start erwischt und hatte daher keine chance gegen damien w hrend des rennens konnte ich sein tempo mitgehen doch da war es bereits zu sp t sein sieg ist jedoch verdient er war das gesamte wochenende sehr stark
654607 heute w re es schwer gewesen ihn zu schlagen aufgrund des meisterschaftsstandes wollte ich kein zu hohes risiko eingehen nun liege ich mit 38 punkten vorsprung an der spitze das gibt sicherheit ab jetzt werde ich daher wieder st rker angreifen und versuchen noch den einen oder anderen laufsiege zu holen
654608 der dritte platz war der erste podiumserfolg f r irwin in der aktuellen saison wir haben wirklich sehr sehr lange darauf hingearbeitet insbesondere david hat in den letzten rennen sehr hart um eine platzierung auf dem treppchen gek mpft er hatte pech und ich hatte heute das gl ck diesen dritten platz zu holen budapest geh rt zu meinen absoluten lieblingsstrecken
654609 schon in den letzten jahren bin ich hier immer sehr gut unterwegs gewesen heute war mir klar dass ich am start sehr gut wegkommen muss um eine chance zu haben das ist mir gelungen und danach konnte ich den dritten platz relativ einfach ins ziel bringen f r den rest des jahres w nsche ich mir noch ein paar podiumserfolge f r unser team vielleicht ist ja jetzt der knoten geplatzt
654610 mein start war alles andere als optimal ich habe gezuckt und bin dann auf die bremse danach war ein guter start nicht mehr m glich im rennen bin ich dann ganz gut unterwegs gewesen hinten hat mir lance viel druck gemacht jedoch konnte ich gut damit umgehen und nach vorne war ich mit dem david saelens besch ftigt es war kein langweiliges rennen sondern vielmehr ein sehr lehrreiches

654627 which u s president has done the most in history to help africa
654628 ill be dead when they finally figure it out bush said in an interview last week
654629 theres no such thing as short term history so i am very confident in telling you that ill be long gone before somebody finally figures out the true merit and meaning of the bush administration
654630 one of the most remarkable features of this struggle is that almost from the start and at almost every turn along the way the bush administration was warned that whatever the short term benefits of its extralegal approach to fighting terrorism it would have tragically destructive long term consequences both for the rule of law and americas interests in the world
654631 the bush administration invoked the fear flowing from the attacks on september 11 to institute a policy of deliberate cruelty that would have been unthinkable on september 10 mayer writes
654632 president bush vice president cheney and a small handful of trusted advisers sought and obtained dubious legal opinions enabling them to circumvent american laws and traditions
654633 when warned that these policies were unlawful and counterproductive they ignored the experts and made decisions outside of ordinary bureaucratic channels and often outside of the publics view

654635 this week an annual report to congress on u s homelessness shows a historic drop in the number of chronically homeless people over a two year period a 30 percent decline between 2005 and 2007 chavez writes in the dallas paper this weekend
654636 the study which is mandated by congress was conducted by researchers from abt associates and the university of pennsylvania center for mental health services and research

654648 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
654649 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
654650 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
654651 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
654652 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
654653 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
654654 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval

654659 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege

654696 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
654697 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level
654698 and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
654699 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the teams which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success

654714 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
654715 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
654716 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
654717 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
654718 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
654719 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
654720 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
654721 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
654722 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
654723 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
654724 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
654725 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
654726 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
654727 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
654728 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
654729 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
654730 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
654731 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
654732 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
654733 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
654734 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
654735 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
654736 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
654737 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
654738 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
654739 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
654740 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
654741 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
654742 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
654743 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
654744 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
654745 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
654746 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
654747 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
654748 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
654749 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
654750 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
654751 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
654752 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
654753 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
654754 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
654755 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
654756 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
654757 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
654758 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
654759 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
654760 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
654761 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
654762 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
654763 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
654764 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
654765 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

654776 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
654777 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
654778 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
654779 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

654793 this is wonderful news for the navajo nation and its president joe shirley who has worked hard for many years to provide the navajo people with the best possible satellite service despite numerous obstacles
654794 we are hopeful that the payment irregularities will soon end and there will be no further threats to turn off this critical service on which so many navajo depend
654795 as chairman martin rightfully pointed out these services should not be confronted with sudden loss of service when dealing with life and death situations we will work closely with the fcc and ses to ensure the most seamless possible transition
654796 this was the most difficult milestone in development of the falcon 9 launch vehicle and it also constitutes a significant achievement in us space vehicle development not since the final flight of the saturn 1b rocket in 1975 has a rocket had the ability to lose any engine or motor and still successfully complete its mission
654797 much like a commercial airliner our multi engine design has the potential to provide significantly higher reliability than single engine competitors

654799 all phases of integration went smoothly and we were elated to see all nine engines working perfectly in concert

654852 the doj is taking an expansive view of executive power and narrow view of judicial power swire told tpmmuckraker in an interview today
654853 under the governments view the judges seem required to uphold an unconstitutional system because the judges are forbidden from getting briefing from anyone other than the executive branch
654854 the 1978 version of fisa targeted one individual at a time or sometime one terrorist organization the new approach sweeps far more broadly and it looks more like an administrative system than a traditional judicial wiretap order
654855 the benefits of open proceedings are greatly outweighed by the potential harm that public access would cause to the national security and integrity of the fisc process
654856 allowing third parties to use this court as a general forum to present facial challenges to the governments surveillance activities could cause a flood of litigation that would distract this court from its important national security functions

654878 the thing that concerns me about ryan he went about everything that he needed to do throughout the spring he was very conscientious
654879 i know running backs coach edgar bennett is in daily contact with him but its time for him to get to camp he is still a young player he doesnt have a high level of experience and its time for him to get here and be a part of what is going on its obviously a contract negotiation but i would really like to see ryan get here

654882 you always want to get more guarantees in a contract like this but from day 1 we recognized that we were in a vulnerable position with three more restricted years two exclusive rights plus one restricted

654887 i think the discussions are moving ahead i would hope well have something resolved by monday
654888 i think we have to force it i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on the behalf of the packers on behalf of brett and on behalf of all the fans
654889 primarly it starts with does brett want to play football and the second question is do the packers want him to play for the packers
654890 those are the two principle points that have to be resolved and only the two parties can make those determinations not me
654891 i dont know i think they are being reasonable there are difficult emotional issues and theyre important to the future of both of them brett has a great legacy and the packers have a great franchise that theyre trying to move forward with i think theyre trying to balance that in a way that is responsible to each party
654892 ill tell you why mccarthy got mad about the mental mistakes and he changed the plays and made us run the ball
654893 we were just lackadaisical during the walkthrough and lackadaisical during practice

654905 the unknown the fear of not knowing what is right or wrong

654923 we all know what the mona lisa looks like and that is of course the one painting we must have safely returned
654924 and he almost slipped through he was wearing a wig a phony mustache and he even sported a deep dark tan he also had the mona lisa it was rolled up with a bunch of architectural drawings get this he still claims hes innocent and that we cant hold him do you belive this guy
654925 you know what im going to need 112 and the clerk charges 75 cents
654926 ya know some things in the bible just dont make sense on the 11th day god said to smite all the cameleons
654927 my blindness was a blessing it allowed me to develop my other talents i listen very well
654928 i disappointed my parents they wanted i guess the best for me they wanted me to use my intelligence and find a way to support myself they hated my interest in thunder they said cut it out they thought that my love of thunder was a distraction from the important things they wanted me to be doing id record it and listen to it and id say listen to this and i remember my mother saying
654929 if you say one more thing about thunder you will be severely punished id have to wait until my mom and dad left the house to get back to my thunder
654930 theyd swat my interest in thunder away like it was a fly
654931 if i saw them they would only say you still havent given up thunder and that would be a great big downer
654932 dear sir please excuse my bad typing but im blind
654933 but ill bet ive talked to him 500 times he seems to always call about two minutes before im going on the air
654934 theyre pulsing up and down hear that rumble its north of here on the hillsborough and pasco borders and that wont help me wait hear it the other one its 4 miles away to the west of us over tampa bay heading for caladesi island its going to miss us
654935 excuse me that one has possibilities its east of us coming this way i must prepare my equipment
654936 i can tell you its challenging enough for a sighted person to make professional recordings there are meters to read tape lengths to consider microphone placement to consider
654937 okay sounds like a good storm it could even have hail it could be big
654938 i have a theory about thunder you can tell how powerful a storm is going to be by its lowest audible frequency i would love to work with someone about this we could warn people about the storm by the sound of the thunder i cant get scientists interested they are like everyone else i have met they are like the people who say to me you are a thunder loving son of a b arent you my dad was like that
654939 god gives you a report card did you go to church check did you read your bible check there are other things too i get angry i curse but i am working on those things i am trying to work on emotional maturity
654940 its just a wonderful gritty environment theres a sense of discovery
654941 they had the large population the industrial living you had three and four families living in a dwelling
654942 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
654943 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
654944 people come down to get fresh ingredients and unique stuff and just to walk around
654945 pittsburgh is a community town and thats why everybody that lives here loves it
654946 pittsburgh isnt the type of town that you go to that has strip malls
654947 i wanted to grow my hair long and stop wearing suits
654948 if we could have bought 24 hours time this may have never happened
654949 is this the culmination of one day or years of depression well never know
654950 most killings are senseless but this one has a domestic overtone followed by suicide which is very unusual
654951 theres narcissistic feeling of if i cant have you no one can suicide is a very selfish act but homicide suicide is the ultimate selfish act because you are denying someone else that decision about whether to live or die
654952 theres kind of a myth out there that teenagers acting depressed angry or anxious are just going through a stage
654953 most teenagers dont act out and are not chronically depressed or chronically anxious they get through their teenage years quite nicely kids especially men who dont want to admit they are depressed may put on a macho mean mask
654954 a lot of times women in an abusive relationship think hell change or i can change him but heres a news flash its not going to happen
654955 the girl thinks thats love and concern when their boyfriend calls them on their cell phone a million times a day but thats emotionally controlling
654956 theres nothing loving about it and isolating behavior is a tremendous alarm bell
654957 i love you so much i have to control you
654958 a glaring difference is that an adult woman depends on this man for their financial security and they end up going back to their abuser
654959 teens have limited life experience and emotional maturity to cope with somebody who is intimidating
654960 the most important thing for parents to do is to check in even if they are young adults
654961 for parents and people around them who are reading about this tragedy overreacting is not a problem if your son or daughter is starting to look or act different then they are going through something and they may be under pressure
654962 its too much irony that this tragedy occurs around the anniversary of wolfs fathers passing
654963 those anniversaries need to be looked at i have also heard from kids that sometimes graduation from high school or college is not a celebratory time because they are unsure of their future
654964 its been proven time and again that children retain more information when theyre stimulated by and actively involved in the learning process interactive teaching has become increasingly popular and new tools and ideas for enhancing lesson plans are appearing every day a great way to get your students interested in learning is to bring the fun back into it by using educational games
654965 its worth the price of admission to see my bulldog put on an outfit and chase the bad guys out of the ring
654966 once they come to our show we have them theyd rather be at one of our events with 500 people than a wwe show
654967 as a pro wrestler hes grappled with all of the sports biggest stars
654968 many of his wrestlers are former wwe competitors and others are on their way to the bigger arenas

654970 it feels like congress gave up on us a long time ago the war is costing billions and people are losing their jobs and their homes i think a lot of people feel like things are hopeless
654971 education should be a presidents top priority its a long term solution to the countrys problems
654972 i wish the presidential candidates would campaign less and start speaking the truth about the issues it seems they only say what you want to hear
654973 i want anyone but obama i was going to vote for hillary but now im voting for mccain hes got more experience and i think hes more of a true blue american
654974 obama is definitely the man for the job the people hell appoint to his cabinet will help him lead this country to a better place with mccain things wont change much at all
654975 the mortgage crisis is a disaster and now the state cant help students with college loans were entering another depression
654976 i dont want to pay 50 to fill my gas tank any more
654977 obama has inspired young people to care about politics and take action
654978 een aantal van onze spelers vindt dat alles tegenwoordig over ronaldo gaat en niet over het huidige team en onze eigen vedettes
654979 to have no more colored children in the home from this time forward
654980 i ran around until they caught me after a while
654981 hundreds of them are boys and girls as young as 10 years who are traveling in bands
654982 with a through freight composed of 100 cars it is impossible for a freight car to keep this swarming army from crowding their train especially the mobs of children they are too agile for a train crew chase them from one empty car and they are half a mile down the train and scrambling into another
654983 i cant imagine why nobody in the black community didnt take him in
654984 but at the time i guess i can nobody had any money
654985 they said no we dont take colored and the nun slammed the door in my mothers face
654986 we went straight to the juvenile home the spokane county juvenile detention center
654987 there was no other place for us to go because we were county charges
654988 we hadnt committed any crime except that of being kids too young to take care of ourselves
654989 black kids were rare enough in this middle class part of spokane not to mention black kids who made their home at the detention center
654990 he said hed take us both in if we wanted to come
654991 i didnt know anything about catholicism but he invited us down and we took him up on it
654992 it was the port in the storm when there didnt seem to be any
654993 there were kids in his class who were in their twenties
654994 but they were all stunted physically and in such bad shape from chewing snoose chewing tobacco and from poor nutrition
654995 barbered by both colored and white shop owners and i assumed the same situation existed here
654996 we felt the best way to prevent recurrence of such a situation was to bring the matter to the attention of the residents of spokane in an orderly fashion
654997 i believe i have the right to accept or reject any person
654998 not to serve colored people because you cannot mix trade in a barbershop and keep your customers
654999 the whole thing was organized as a closely controlled demonstration with one purpose we want to make our point and then we are finished and we do not want to do anything that would reflect badly on the university
655000 i have operated shops in spokane for 45 years and it is my policy not to serve colored persons
655001 this personal service is somewhat different than selling merchandise i have refused to serve many people including both white and negro but there has never been any trouble because of that policy
655002 takes away from majority groups their civil rights under the guise of protecting the civil rights of minority groups
655003 there is not the shadow of suggestion of entrapment in this case
655004 the eyes of the world are on spokane and on a small barber shop
655005 with a tone of controlled outrage maxey pointed out that this sort of behavior had been banned decades ago
655006 we are arguing whether or not a negro has the right to public accommodation
655007 the statute will not permit him to say you are a slave or the son of a slave therefore i will not shave you
655008 dissent is proper in this democracy but when dissent prohibits others from being heard it is not the type of dissent we need this type of dissent which is evident here does nothing but lead to anarchy and frustration
655009 many young people however say they cannot participate in government and in politics
655010 i say to you they can if they just go to work within the framework of the two major political parties the republican party welcomes them if they just quit crying and start working this will accomplish more than just carrying obscene signs down the street
655011 a group of smartly clad young women in white blouses skimmer hats and nixon agnew ribbons
655012 despite voices of dissent from a few this generation has produced the finest group of young people we have ever had in this country
655013 the united states has never been a saber rattling nation
655014 i want to remind you that when the united states had the only nuclear capacity in the world we could have conquered the world and for those who called us imperialists look at our conduct
655015 well its really tragic to think that somewhere somebody in that young mans life has failed him
655016 we do not believe this young man should be arrested or incarcerated because of a simple exercise of free speech
655017 i didnt go there to embarrass or insult the candidate i didnt agree with him and thought it was my place to say something so i did i am concerned about the country and our involvement in vietnam i think it is wrong to be there
655018 somewhere somebody in that young mans life has failed him
655019 the peace and good order of the community has been offended by your words and actions
655020 the way things are going we are in a tough position as to what can be done to keep order we all have the right to speech and dissent but there is an orderly way to do it or we will end up in shambles perhaps the 100 fine is sufficient to deter others from doing the same
655021 an intense recital of his views against what he called an immoral war
655022 he also said he believed that shouting a protest at politically rally
655023 no man may exercise his rights at an unreasonable expense to others
655024 political rally was a noisy and partisan event shouting the word warmonger but once without more to indicate a further purpose or intention of breaking up the meeting or to deprive the speaker of his audience or to interfere with the rights of others to hear or the speaker to speak did not amount to a disturbance of the peace in fact or in law
655025 they told me i could either go to africa as a ii a deferred because of occupation or stay at home as a c o conscientious objector so i figured that teaching school would be a bigger help than dumping bedpans in some hospital
655026 the more we see and read of agnew the more your comment becomes appropriate
655027 isnt it idiotic that you should be arrested for calling a warmonger a warmonger agnew should have been in jail four or five times over

655054 today we come across an individual who behaves like an automaton who does not know or understand himself and the only person that he knows is the person that he is supposed to be whose meaningless chatter has replaced communicative speech whose synthetic smile has replaced genuine laughter and whose sense of dull despair has taken the place of genuine pain two statements may be said concerning this individual one is that he suffers from defects of spontaneity and individuality which may seem to be incurable at the same time it may be said of him he does not differ essentially from the millions of the rest of us who walk upon this earth

655056 former vice president al gore called thursday for a man on the moon effort to switch all of the nations electricity production to wind solar and other carbon free sources within 10 years a goal that he said would solve global warming as well as economic and natural security crises caused by dependence on fossil fuels
655057 surely gore knows that the u s is only a tiny part of the worlds land mass population and energy use
655058 the conclusion from his proposal is that the entire problem is caused only by us and we can fix it all by ourselves maybe he misspoke maybe the reporter got it wrong maybe he forgot about communist china and india and like the other continents
655059 bring it on show me every last quirky concern document it well dont abuse e g w with silly accusations that cant stand scrutiny be generous and full of goodwill but bring on the evidence lets examine context and see how our conclusions compare
655060 the folks who want the diocese of pittsburgh to realign have their own blog now if you want to know what the culture of the realignment will be like spend a few minutes looking at it i remember when the osbournes tv show came out someone said that the program which many thought would glorify the drug culture of rock and roll was actually the greatest anti drug ad ever produced i think we have a parallel here
655061 in particular this is problematic in light of the importance of the distinctive voice of the johannine corpus in the witness of the nt as a whole lately i have been immersed in the gospel and epistles of john first john is not an epistle however but thats another matter and am becoming more and more convinced that these books of some of the most theologically intricate and subversive in the entire canon the depth of johannine sophistication particularly in regard to issues of christology trinitarian doctrine and ecclesiology is consistently underestimated in the broad sweep of christian theological reflection on the nt moreover there is a fundamental and deeply theological and literary unity to the johannine corpus including revelation that is more intricate and intentional than perhaps any other discernible group of books in the nt fortunately scholars like raymond brown david rensberger and j louis martyn have done a great job approaching the johannine corpus from the point of view of sociological analysis biblical theology and exegesis there is much to learn from these and other thinkers who have investigated deeply into johannine theology and the ecclesial roots of these writings in the johannine community which even if reconstructions such as browns are a bit overconfident do make clear a very different and very radical form of christian community and life taking place alongside the pauline and petrine churches during the first and second century of the churchs existence
655062 the helicopters which in reality were from the army picked up the hostages in guaviare and flew them to freedom
655063 it will go down in history for its audaciousness and effectiveness
655064 today a nightmare of more than six years has ended ingrid is in good health
655065 president bush congratulated president uribe telling him he is a strong leader president uribe thanked president bush for his support and confidence in the government of colombia
655066 the colombian government took advantage of the farcs weakness and disarray to carry out the mission it was a big gamble but it worked
655067 uribe is a risk taker and is full of surprises not that he needs it but this remarkable turn of events will further boost his popularity
655068 an important aspect is the cultural change in fathers participation and involvement with children from parental leave to child care
655069 its really the small things but they all add up to something wonderful
655070 i dont want to sound corny but truly its the greatest gift ive ever had
655071 theres more of an acceptance that yes men can do these things and can and should take part in the raising of the child
655072 you can always make money but you can never make time
655073 a cultural shift that embraces fatherhood and mens involvement with their children
655074 if the option is to take a leave at the cost of a big financial hit and lack of support in the workplace then we shouldnt be surprised
655075 to be able to know i can do this is great i do feel that by being involved now i want to be more involved it was a good base to build on
655076 and the earlier you practise that the more competent you feel and the more involved you continue to get
655077 the quebec program is quite a different program than the federal program
655078 certainly because its more generous it has definitely encouraged a higher participation rate among fathers in quebec
655079 its very clear its having a very strong impact on fathers taking paternity leave in quebec
655080 its very important for fathers to be involved and many of them want and choose to be
655081 the extent to which policy can support them to be involved for more than a few days or a week is seen as a progressive form of social policy
655082 the increase in the participation rate for fathers is clearly tied to the changes to the rules of the programs
655083 but i think its also fair to say its tied to an overall cultural shift that promotes fatherhood
655084 being a good dad now involves being an active father just as being a good mom may involve being an earner as well
655085 its going to be really hard to put a roof over your head with cycling
655086 i didnt fail i found 2 000 ways how not to make a light bulb i only need to find one way to make it work
655087 and he wasnt going to let anything stand in his way
655088 i really thank god that he has given josiah that kind of motivation
655089 all of the eyes in the world would be on me for that instant
655090 being somewhat americanized he doesnt really care what people think of him or if people know its him when hes in malaysia
655091 hes just him and he likes doing what he likes
655092 i picked up a copy of the malaysian sun featuring josiah on it and wondered who this hunk was
655093 she didnt know much about sports so she googled me shes pretty handy on the computer after all
655094 i found his web site and decided to drop him a good luck comment on his guestbook
655095 so i linked to her blog and thought what a cute girl
655096 one thing led to another and we found ourselves eventually meeting up the rest is history we never looked back he never hesitated
655097 its like roller derby with bikes its santa anita racetrack with bikes its short track speedskating with bikes its anything can happen
655098 i was hooked it was like a self propelled roller coaster
655099 he knows exactly what hes going to do and why hes going to do it and then he only makes moves he needs to make to gain an advantage there are guys who like to fight for fightings sake but josiah does everything for winnings sake
655100 thats exciting news but to be honest with you that doesnt change anything
655101 the gold is just as attractive with or without the incentive ive already dedicated my life to achieving the highest honors at the olympic games the money would just be icing on the cake
655102 i feel great after pushing my body to its limits for example if im feeling sad or depressed it usually goes away after a good hard and sweaty session
655103 i wake up at 7am and training begins from 8am to 10am my afternoon session normally goes from 3pm until 6pm as a professional athlete my workout regime is the number one priority on my schedule everything else is secondary
655104 i just love it and cant picture myself doing anything else while everyone else is getting up to go to work at a 9 5 desk job i get up to train because i love the feeling of fine tuning my body
655105 are you kidding me i dont limit myself to just one indulgence and i have to admit i have a sweet tooth where chocolate and ice cream is concerned but i have to practise self control when it comes to food like that they arent bad if taken in moderation
655106 my dad is a preventive care doctor and mother is a dietician so i was pretty much born and raised as a health nut
655107 you just go out there and do it you obviously dont have to do six sessions twice a day but take baby steps with 30 minutes a day on most days of the week and build it up you have to start from somewhere dont try to push yourself too hard especially if you havent exercised before or in a long time if you can afford it find a professional fitness trainer and an activity that you like to do as the gym isnt for everyone
655108 what you see on television and magazines are edited making a normal body look super good come on everyone has a bit of flab here and there just do what makes you feel good
655109 non capisco perch mio figlio non si sia ancora sposato alla sua et io avevo gi conosciuto suo padre avevo gi fatto la mia fuitina e pianificavo di sposarmi quanto prima

655117 the government of canada strongly believes that the involvement of aboriginal peoples is vital to the overall success of the 2010 winter games
655118 the leaders of the four host first nations recognized very early on that the vancouver 2010 winter games represented a tremendous opportunity for their communities and for all first nations inuit and m tis peoples
655119 the government of canada is a proud supporter of the 2010 winter games we and all canadians look forward to a memorable opening ceremony that will allow the world to see the best that canada has to offer
655120 if he was running in that riding as a conservative he wouldnt have a chance
655121 the faith of citizens in a system under which we have to govern
655122 an appropriate level of scrutiny on this matter a decision that i believe robs canadians and the people of vancouver kingsway of a deserved explanation
655123 anyone who crosses the floor ultimately should go back to the people for ratification and i stick by it and hopefully in this case that will happen
655124 instead of having someone in opposition they have someone who is a cabinet minister of a new government
655125 in the best interests of not just british columbia but good government
655126 the former liberal industry minister worried that a pre election announcement would damage liberal prospects in key british columbia ridings
655127 ill participate in that debate i may even vote for it and i will certainly abide by it
655128 satisfied that no special inducement was offered by mr harper to convince mr emerson to join his cabinet and his party
655129 canadas bargaining position was strong our conditions were clear and this agreement delivers
655130 its a good deal that resolves this long standing dispute and allows us to move on
655131 mr emerson has a very mature attitude and approach to this very very important file for canada and i dont think it was treated as important as it was in the recent past
655132 i think hell bring a really solid perspective and represent canada in a very positive way and in a way that other countries will respect and appreciate
655133 if he sees something that might help a part of canada in another country i think hell help it without having a whole lot of politics in it
655134 i think mr harper appreciates mr emerson enough to give him the latitude he needs to do the job the way he needs to do it
655135 im sure he wouldnt have taken it unless he could have that
655136 their approach is different their approach is very different im sure theyll have differences of opinion but again i think the fact that mr harper appreciates mr emerson means mr emerson will have the flexibility to do it the way he wants to do it
655137 i have no doubt that there is tension in the conservative caucus over china essentially over how to maintain trade relations while pursuing a tough line on chinas human rights record
655138 i suspect that future canadian policy towards china will steer quietly in the direction of greater attention to fostering trade relations
655139 i dont think emerson was put into foreign affairs to achieve that objective primarily but it will be a file he will be comfortable with
655140 there is no doubt in my mind that he has a clear sense of canadian interests
655141 he doesnt have the values agenda as his motivation only time will tell whether he broadens canadas role in the world to accord more with our interests as distinct from exporting our values
655142 mr emerson through his portfolio as international trade minister is very well aware of the dynamics of the international scene and so he brings that strength to this portfolio
655143 he brings strength and he will continue promoting those goals of our foreign policy
655144 we have been very clear the prime minister everybody where the foreign policy objectives of this government is
655145 everybody is moving in that direction it is run by what was outlined as to where this government will be putting its efforts on the international scene as outlined by prime minister myself mr bernier mr mackay everybody
655146 the decision as to how who and what the canadian foreign policy objectives are is made by the prime minister

655153 i did not adore him but that god who hath honored him with his high priesthood for i saw this very person in a dream in this very habit when i was at dios in macedonia who when i was considering with myself how i might obtain the dominion of asia exhorted me to make no delay but boldly to pass over the sea thither for that he would conduct my army and would give me the dominion over the persians whence it is that having seen no other in that habit and now seeing this person in it and remembering that vision and the exhortation which i had in my dream i believe that i bring this army under the divine conduct and shall therewith conquer darius and destroy the power of the persians and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind
655154 but to go forth to meet him and welcome him we are to strew the city with flowers and adorn it as for a festive celebration the priests are to be dressed in their pontifical robes and go forth and the inhabitants are to follow them in a civic procession in this way we are to go out to meet alexander as he advances and all will be well
655155 when i was in macedon before setting out on this expedition while i was revolving the subject in my mind musing day after day on the means of conquering asia one night i had a remarkable dream in my dream this very priest appeared before me dressed just as he is now he exhorted me to banish every fear to cross the hellespont boldly and to push forward into the heart of asia he said that god would march at the head of my army and give me the victory over all the persians i recognize this priest as the same person that appeared to me then he has the same countenance the same dress the same stature the same air it is through his encouragement and aid that i am here and i am ready to worship and adore the god whose service he administers

655253 if you call your childs father a cheating no good bastard or whatever your child could very well interpret that to mean that part of him her is bad too
655254 yes divorce is a slow process especially when custody issues are involved
655255 as time goes on your hormones and or loneliness may make sex with your ex very tempting especially if you didnt want the split in the first place but if your kids see daddy making coffee in the morning or run into him in the bathroom in the middle of the night theyre going to be very confused theyll assume youve gotten back together when they find out thats not the case theyll be crushed theyll also find it harder to trust you and what you say in the future its not fair to put them on that emotional rollercoaster it wont be easy but you can develop a platonic relationship with your childs father set that boundary stick to it no matter what and eventually youll both move on
655256 they may not know what exactly is going on or be able to verbalize their feelings about it but they can tell when a home is filled with tension resentment anger apathy and or sadness and theyll be adversely affected by it the fact is if youre unhappy your home will be unhappy and ultimately your kids will be unhappy so get over your guilt and stop thinking that sacrificing your own happiness by staying in a bad relationship will be better for the kids this is one of those times in life that you need to put yourself first for the good of all kind of like how airlines instruct you to put on your oxygen mask before your childs its not selfish
655257 thats about it nothing really major ill go in and get some treatment over the next two days and ill be fine
655258 i didnt tear anything or anything like that its hot out here sometimes those things happen you have little tweaks and stuff like that other than that im fine its no big deal i didnt tear anything i slowed down actually when i felt it tighten up on me that was a good thing other than that i dont think it will be a problem
655259 im pleased with my driving but i came here to win and loeb found a few seconds more we played cat and mouse all weekend and when i won a stage he usually won the next for there to be only nine seconds between us after all this crazy driving is amazing i lost the time by not being brave enough in the narrow sections itll be difficult but we must now fight for the win on every round
655260 it was a fantastic rally and an amazing fight and its unfortunate i didnt win in front of my home fans i pushed right to the end but it wasnt enough im pleased to still lead the championship but one point isnt much the speed was crazy sometimes we could have thrown our pace notes away and just gone for it and ive learned that i could have made my notes quicker
655261 i wanted to win here but it was still a fantastic event the championship fight is not over but of course all the rallies coming up are more important now its not over yet
655262 the event on the whole was really good and i was extremely happy with how everything went we were cautious in some places and then had to lift the pace in other areas because thats how you have to be here it is all about balance we had a couple of moments and it could have gone either way for us this is a very competitive event and everyone is fighting for those precious seconds to clock up an 11th place finish especially as i have limited experience in this region is great
655263 germany is a tarmac event and it has been quite a while since i competed on that surface it will be interesting you have to change your driving style considerably as it requires a different set of lines and approaches so we will see how it goes
655264 the rally didnt go as i expected unfortunately and i didnt achieve what i wanted which was a podium i feel quite empty it ended for me on friday morning and that was all due to an error i made on the recce when i didnt mark a rock in my pace notes at least i got my confidence rhythm and speed back and drove the new stages which is good for future efforts it was difficult to be motivated but the best medicine after an accident is to get back behind the wheel i know the speed is there so i hope that next year ill have the chance to fight for a win here
655265 we are extremely proud of the many heroic and brave achievements of our son and brother gerard

655276 the tar should be applied at least 30 minutes prior to sunbathing to allow the tar to penetrate sufficiently the tar should not be applied too thick so as to filter out the ultraviolet rays
655277 anyone using tar on a regular basis should be aware of the signs of skin cancer and see a dermatologist for a skin cancer check up
655278 there is little risk in using tar on the scalp since it is normally in contact with the scalp for only short periods of time however some people do leave tar medica tions on the scalp overnight this could increase cancer risk

655283 improvement should be observed within a couple of weeks of starting the tar therapy though it may take up to two months for the maximum benefit to be obtained
655284 there is inadequate scientific evidence to support any health claims on fish oils

655300 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war with iran
655301 the one plan that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the strait of hormuz start a shoot up

655324 es geht hier um die rechte unserer mehr als 360 000 kollegen die nicht beliebig verhandelbar sind
655325 ich bin weiter an einer einigung interessiert aber aus zuffenhausen wird st ndig l ins feuer gegossen
655326 wir f hren gute und offene gespr che in denen wir auch deutliche kritik u ern k nnen lesen dann aber wieder scharfmachereien und unterstellungen in der presse unter vier augen wird vern nftig geredet dann folgen wieder ffentlichkeitswirksame kraftmeiereien die herrn wiedeking zum titanen ausrufen
655327 es sieht danach aus als w rde jemand im hintergrund alles torpedieren weil er keine einigung will
655328 wenn man j rgen peters dazu braucht soll er dazukommen
655329 ich bin sehr erstaunt ber den plumpen versuch von porsche jetzt auch noch die ig metall f r das eigene versagen verantwortlich zu machen die vw belegschaft die kollegen huber und peters und der konzernbetriebsrat von volkswagen sind geschlossen der meinung dass die bei porsche verhandelte mitbestimmungsvereinbarung erhebliche m ngel aufweist
655330 und wenn es jahre dauert kein gewerkschafter wird die mitbestimmungsrechte seiner kollegen kampflos aufgeben
655331 wenn die belegschaften des vw konzerns diesen vertrag k ndigen wollen dann geht dies nur wenn auch die arbeitnehmervertreter von porsche zustimmen 11 400 porsche besch ftigte haben dann die m glichkeit den willen von 360 000 vw besch ftigten zu unterdr cken eine solche regelung steht dem demokratieprinzip der deutschen mitbestimmung und unserer sozialen marktwirtschaft zutiefst entgegen
655332 es sieht danach aus als w rde jemand im hintergrund alles torpedieren weil er keine einigung will
655333 wenn man j rgen peters dazu braucht soll er dazukommen
655334 ich werde meinen teil dazu beitragen und kompromisse eingehen denn ich m chte mit den kollegen von vw gut und professionell zusammenarbeiten

655347 the march 8 election was a warning to them to act quickly and take steps to tackle issues like rising costs and crime restoring the judiciary and bringing equitable development for all
655348 but the bn has not only lost its sense of priorities it has also lost its direction
655349 i never thought much about it until the first of the month july when i had to put her in the hospital because she was real sick
655350 i went all through the house looking for her and i went to the garage and the car wasnt there
655351 i waited until 5 a m to see if she might have just gone to the store to get something but i didnt think so and i called the police
655352 i was afraid when i saw the car gone that this what was going to happen
655353 i dont go anywhere i dont party i dont do anything
655354 it makes you really bitter you know someone else is really benefiting from this
655355 it is perhaps a sign of the publics anxiety that many new jerseyans support drilling for oil off our coast as well as elsewhere in the country even though they dont have a lot of confidence it will actually bring down prices
655356 new jerseys coastline is the lifeblood of our economy and a fragile environmental treasure that helps shape our way of life and the governor intends to fight any attempt to jeopardize it
655357 the way to bring down gas prices is to stop speculators from driving up the price of gas force opec to stop hoarding oil and end price gouging
655358 new jersey families desperately need relief from out of control gasoline and energy prices
655359 even with all of the precautions you cant account for human error
655360 people are always looking for easy answers to complex problems
655361 anything that will bring down the price of gas is fine by me
655362 in the long run it relates back to very ancient methods of trying to achieve some kind of stability in your life or achieving spirituality and of physically healing oneself
655363 you get people who will modify their bodies for psychological reasons and some of those are healthy
655364 but some of the people were talking about on the show have psychological issues that are played out by their tattoos and theyre trying to shock people influence people tell stories by their tattoos
655365 theyve got real psychological issues that push them to do it
655366 i was wired from the adrenaline i was trying to self evaluate i reviewed so many conversations with other gms i had during the day how could i have handled something differently or said something differently so many elements running through my mind
655367 i mean seriously you dont make amends when you sexually assault someone you pay for it for the remainder of your life just as theyll have to deal with your thoughtless actions
655368 and your whole post is pity pity me what about her kyle you mention her in passing in that massive self serving missive wow you suck women and feminism dont exist for you kyle in fact you are the last thing either of them need
655369 oh but this is soooooo beautiful who cares about investing on cleaner water and in the process lowering the taxes of the citizens of that town by decreasing the level of debt oh hell to the noooooooooez weve got to get rid of them damn sluts and dem queers and all that nasty ungodly sexsexsexsexsex 111111one11 i know lets buy up that damn place and burn that sucka down
655370 in the end thats all we can ever do present our arguments and have enough faith in those arguments that they alone will cause someone to see our side of the story changing someones mind does not come by telling them how wrong they are by what they should change or by demeaning them yelling at them or lecturing them i have seen all of these and i am sickened by it
655371 i hope ive been able to serve as a gateway between us regular folks and people on the forefront of modern sexuality i hope ive helped plant the seeds of a more positive and relaxed approach to sex particularly as our most intimate lives become more entwined with our technologies
655372 so yesterday i got an email actually from kyle payne telling me that he would be putting up a statement on his blog today regarding recent events in his life its funny how for someone who claims he wants to hold himself accountable for his own actions he repeatedly uses that word events i think that if were going to go with euphemisms here and im absolutely no fan of euphemisms my actions would be a much more accurate one than recent events in my life see events happen around you and to you you are the one who sexually assaulted a woman and then pleaded guilty to secretly filming and photographing a womans breasts kyle that didnt happen to you but it did happen to the woman who was assaulted
655373 so now im just a plain old feminist down here in the gutter where the saintly radfems believe all feminists and women who do not agree with them live the wrong side of the tracks its nice here i like it people even if they think your opinions are stupid speak to you with respect as long as you speak to them with respect naturally they dont hold you to some unspoken unwritten rules and you can express yourself freely i will have no truck with the superiority complex disease that goes with too much radical feminism on the internet or the notion that online radfems form some sort of special club it is bollocks and i dont want anything to do with people who will make the sorts of comments listed above
655374 hardest part was getting flies off the ancient windows machine

655403 i havent spoken to the chief executive today saturday so i cant tell you more than that hes the one negotiating with everton
655404 is a kind of dusty holiday decoration that gets pulled out of the attic and displayed on the porch for the fourth of july its a topic for kids essay contests or the old codgers down at the vfw not something you talk much about around the office
655405 how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child
655406 we cannot hide the fact that we need new players everybody knows it i know it the players know it we have to get five or six players in before the season starts
655407 there is not enough competition for the players to realise that if they play poorly they will not be selected we are a long way away from where we think we are going to be but that is due to several different circumstances
655408 we are in a poor poor situation regarding going forward
655409 this is an economy where people are on edge about things like downsizing and getting laid off and heres a guy who has wielded that knife
655410 i believe most americans want their next president to remind them of the guy who they work with not the guy who laid them off
655411 you can spin you can jive youre helping the buyout guys
655412 for all of his the positive tension hes gotten for his turnaround accomplishments there is a dark underbelly that feds into a lot of the anger out there in the work force
655413 the likely scenario is that the unions quarterback that line of attack
655414 i was responsible for a firm that invested other peoples money

655426 seven things barack obama should do to keep from blowing it
655427 this campaign cant only be about me it must be about us it must be about what we can do together this campaign must be the occasion the vehicle of your hopes and your dreams it will take your time your energy and your advice to push us forward when were doing right and to let us know when were not this campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship restoring our sense of common purpose and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change thats why im in this race not just to hold an office but to gather with you to transform a nation
655428 you sir are forgetting all of those who helped you get to where you are today
655429 democracy cannot exist without strong differences and going forward some of you may decide that my fisa position is a deal breaker thats ok but i think it is worth pointing out that our agreement on the vast majority of issues that matter outweighs the differences we may have
655430 sono riuscito a parlare a lungo con un paio di persone che lavorano alla
655431 i was the one who didnt want the reunion i took a hell of a lot of persuading because i was so reluctant to go back into it for all sorts of reasons
655432 part of it was i felt we could never recapture those times and there was a big part of me that just didnt want to be reminded of who i was back then
655433 its amazing to think that as part of the biggest band on the planet i spent most of my time completely miserable because i had a terrible eating disorder
655434 at the height of it all i wasnt eating and i was exercising so much my periods stopped and my bone density was low
655435 the worst thing for me was that i was a role model to millions of young girls
655436 eventually i thought why not the other girls really wanted to do it at first i was frightened of being overwhelmed by all those old feelings but then i started to feel that maybe this was something i had to do
655437 the idea of putting on a great pop show was appealing as was the idea of spending time with the girls
655438 it was an incredibly positive experience were all older and wiser and we put a lot of ghosts to rest on that tour
655439 when it was over i was finally proud to be a spice girl all those frightened negative mixed feelings had disappeared
655440 whatever was said we all got on incredibly well weve had our fights and feuds but were now more like sisters than friends
655441 but theyre a bit behind with their gossip they kept asking me whether i was a lesbian which was funny and quite sweet
655442 i havent been asked that in years i know everyone thought i was gay when i had my hair cut and put on a bit of weight and of course because of my tattoos
655443 slide does not condone violence whatsoever and our superpoke application is meant to foster fun virtual communications between friends we have removed this particular action as it misrepresents the superpoke brand
655444 why the hell would a social networking site for teenagers put something like this forward
655445 if the authorities really want to get tough on knife crime the ceo or directors of facebook should be arrested for inciting violence
655446 use superpoke to do stuff to your friends if you get lucky they might just do it back to you
655447 well i didnt actually shank anyone its a computer thing it just sends them a message
655448 fine im going back to sleep just stay out of my shit gary

655450 hope and aspiration of the tibetan people for freedom justice and the commitment of people around the world to help achieve this goal
655451 for tibetans the olympics offer a rare opportunity to shine a spotlight on the chinese governments abysmal policies in tibet and to show chinese leaders that the time has come to negotiate an end to its occupation of tibet
655452 the work that the world community must do the work that indian government and its people must do for tibet is done by tibetan people alone
655453 not going to let a woman talk that way to me

655459 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
655460 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
655461 i have never felt self congratulatory in any way about my involvement because it did precipitate a conflict which eventually claimed 3 500 lives and that is inescapable
655462 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
655463 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
655464 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
655465 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means
655466 between the pomposity of bew and the extravagance of mccann i might look like the sane one
655467 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing children
655468 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
655469 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
655470 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
655471 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society i also feel that the partys left wing credentials have been damaged by the above and by a continued courtship with the american administration
655472 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters
655473 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
655474 yes its a rap about particle physics yes it mentions antimatter and the bbc report an
655475 criminal and anti social elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities
655476 while the provincial man looks to the opinion of the metropolis the parochial is never in any doubt about the social and artistic validity of his parish
655477 these cases are due to come before the tribunals and will be strenuously defended by ofmdfm in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment further

655482 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
655483 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
655484 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
655485 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
655486 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
655487 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
655488 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
655489 you wouldnt worry so much about what people really thought of you if you knew just how seldom they actually do
655490 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
655491 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
655492 it came to me that this woman loves and worships the same god i do
655493 i had this sharpened awareness that in that moment she was in touch with god just as i was it was a dawning and an awakening and it was liberating because it liberates you from standing on a pedestal and looking down on someone else
655494 beyond 9 11 christians and muslims together a new world vision
655495 is that we can find a way to bridge the chasm between christians muslims jews hindus and buddhists and make atlanta a model city that over the next year or two we can develop an interfaith immersion program
655496 a soft evangelical i ask questions and listen rather than telling people what they ought to do or believe
655497 im the most unlikely candidate for becoming a spokesperson about islam
655498 i wondered who i was now that i wasnt a teacher preacher traveler or speaker
655499 you get beneath the dogma and creeds to the essence of what religion is about its about god in human beings in human consciousness
655500 a voice in my head said and you dont know anything about islam which was true i have five degrees four of them theological and other religions had never been taught seriously to me
655501 everything about my faith is rooted in the stories my two grandmothers told me
655502 no one formally taught me to pray as a child i had the question what is god like my grandmother answered that is like a drop in the ocean trying to understand what the ocean is like this is something i feel with my heart god is present in everything god is all around us
655503 there were a couple of imams muslim clerics and im thinking they know all this stuff and im stumbling around in it
655504 we had a pastor and an imam describe how they came to the faith that gives their lives meaning
655505 and we asked people to talk at their tables about how their faith came to them
655506 i dont think just knowledge about another faith is any good
655507 youve gotta meet someone who is of the faith who is speaking out of conviction and out of experience to really feel what islam is like
655508 puts muslims at ease because hes mastered the broad historical perspective of islam but also some of the nuanced details
655509 people are more open to learning a new perspective from someone they respect ben is not trying to convert anyone but to inform people and build understanding
655510 when i heard him talk about islam i thought we need him
655511 many christians are fearful of islam so they put up barriers they trust ben so they are willing to take the first step and listen for understanding
655512 if you sit in silence you can get deep enough into your faith that it touches another person
655513 the reality is that at the core were all the same
655514 in my 76th year i would be passionate about getting christians jews muslims and hindus together nothing in my history would point me in this direction this is not my dream i think its the spirit of god
655515 human blood is the life line of islam violence its hallmark and hate its foundation in the beginning islam lives on the blood of infidels when that is unavailable or becomes difficult islam must cannibalize itself
655516 like children playing with dynamite western intellectuals journalists and diplomats fantasize that they are achieving results in the middle east with their words promises apologies money and concessions yet how can such innocents cope with polities and societies whose basic ruling ethos is that of the serial killer can anyone really expect a stable society capable of progress in pakistan when a large majority of the population expresses admiration for usama bin ladin and what about the saudi system where as one local writer put it the big usama put into practice what the little usama learned in a saudi school the radical forces in the region are not expecting to retain or gain power by negotiating compromising or being better understood they believe they are going to shoot their way into power or just as good accept the surrender of those they have intimidated that is why so much of the western analysis and strategies for dealing with the region are a bad joke
655517 europe is being targeted for deliberate colonization by muslim states and with coordinated efforts aimed at our islamization and the elimination of our freedoms we are being subject to a foreign invasion and aiding and abetting a foreign invasion in any way constitutes treason if non europeans have the right to resist colonization and desire self determination then europeans have that right too and we intend to exercise it
655518 a muslim apostate once suggested to me a litmus test for westerners
655519 muslims who share the same goals as osama bin laden but are pursuing
655520 after years of attempted dialogue islam and christianity have begun to find consensus on subjects of shared interest
655521 these topics range from the family to pollution poverty and the distribution of natural resources
655522 we have noted that the pontiff holds more advanced views on this subject than most of society and we would like public broadcasters to devote more air time to inter religious dialogue
655523 this would help counter prejudiced notions that islam is a violent religion to be discriminated against
655524 human blood is the life line of islam violence its hallmark and hate its foundation in the beginning islam lives on the blood of infidels when that is unavailable or becomes difficult islam must cannibalize itself
655525 like children playing with dynamite western intellectuals journalists and diplomats fantasize that they are achieving results in the middle east with their words promises apologies money and concessions yet how can such innocents cope with polities and societies whose basic ruling ethos is that of the serial killer can anyone really expect a stable society capable of progress in pakistan when a large majority of the population expresses admiration for usama bin ladin and what about the saudi system where as one local writer put it the big usama put into practice what the little usama learned in a saudi school the radical forces in the region are not expecting to retain or gain power by negotiating compromising or being better understood they believe they are going to shoot their way into power or just as good accept the surrender of those they have intimidated that is why so much of the western analysis and strategies for dealing with the region are a bad joke

655527 a muslim apostate once suggested to me a litmus test for westerners
655528 muslims who share the same goals as osama bin laden but are pursuing
655529 think about who is in thurston county a lot of them are employees of state government i think they will tell you i have asked a lot of them but i have clearly treated them with respect
655530 bad mouths state employees all the time wrong message for the work force you are to lead they are dedicated they are hard working people theyve got families like anybody else and they need to be treated with respect
655531 the leadership style i want to bring to this is really centered on customer service
655532 im going to need the help of state employees once i get there were going to have a clear mission to turn this into an entrepreneurial state
655533 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
655534 the jobs and taxes the internal combustion engine creates would have to be replaced
655535 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
655536 most of us have families that are spread out and we do place a high degree of importance on seeing them long distance travel by ev is not really possible and even if batteries are unproved 10 times it will not compete with internal combustion in range time and cost until gas is a lot more expensive than now
655537 we will have evs they will be far from perfect
655538 the winner is an lng tanker with a drunken captain
655539 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
655540 education education education science science science maths maths maths you can stick your religion and faith up your arse
655541 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
655542 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
655543 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
655544 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
655545 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
655546 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
655547 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
655548 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
655549 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
655550 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
655551 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
655552 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
655553 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
655554 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
655555 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable

655564 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
655565 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
655566 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation

655570 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
655571 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over

655574 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
655575 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
655576 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
655577 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
655578 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
655579 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
655580 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
655581 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
655582 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
655583 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
655584 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
655585 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
655586 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
655587 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
655588 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
655589 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
655590 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
655591 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
655592 beware of those powers which come from god but which can so easily be purloined by the devil
655593 a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural or exceptional powers or qualities
655594 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
655595 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
655596 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
655597 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
655598 does frankf38 know anything at all about cars or energy
655599 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
655600 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
655601 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
655602 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
655603 i am really proud of the way we played in this test match
655604 the first test was one of those games where nothing went right for us but the way we have come back after four days its really amazing
655605 i am really proud of the fact that i have this group of players who have shown so much resilience not just once but time and time again
655606 the way viru sehwag got those runs scoring 201 out of 329 is something that is really amazing
655607 and also taking that forward to the second innings is never easy it was brilliant batting our opening partnerships in both innings were very important for us
655608 for a 19 year old to crank it up like he sharma did was something special
655609 i thought chasing 307 on a fourth day pitch was a good score to chase but its important you get a good start in any run chase
655610 we didnt get that and being 10 for three was obviously not ideal were very disappointed with those last two sessions
655611 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
655612 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
655613 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
655614 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
655615 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
655616 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
655617 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
655618 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
655619 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
655620 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
655621 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
655622 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
655623 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
655624 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
655625 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
655626 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
655627 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
655628 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
655629 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
655630 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
655631 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
655632 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
655633 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
655634 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
655635 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
655636 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
655637 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
655638 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
655639 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
655640 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
655641 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
655642 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
655643 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
655644 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
655645 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
655646 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
655647 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
655648 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
655649 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
655650 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
655651 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
655652 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
655653 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
655654 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
655655 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
655656 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
655657 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
655658 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
655659 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
655660 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
655661 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
655662 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
655663 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
655664 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
655665 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
655666 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
655667 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
655668 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
655669 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
655670 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
655671 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
655672 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
655673 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
655674 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
655675 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
655676 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
655677 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
655678 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
655679 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
655680 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
655681 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
655682 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
655683 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
655684 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
655685 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
655686 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
655687 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
655688 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
655689 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
655690 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
655691 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
655692 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
655693 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
655694 ich kenne den pr sidenten von ata spor ganz gut und er hat den kontakt zu mir gekn pft
655695 wenn er an der seitenlinie steht wird bei uns die h lle los sein
655696 karten f r olympia habe ich auch keine bekommen sagte lorant der im april den posten angenommen hatte
655697 ich w rde sagen wir sind idealisten idealismus ist mit einer gewissen naivit t verbunden
655698 der ioc pr sident hat mit seinem katastrophalen krisenmanagement und widerspr chlicher informationspolitik der olympischen idee und der achtung der menschenrechte in china schweren schaden zugef gt
655699 ich m chte alle sportlerinnen und sportler ermutigen genau hin und nicht wegzusehen
655700 die sportler sollten auch daran denken dass es nicht sinnvoll w re sich die erfolge jahrelanger vorbereitung durch einen regelversto zu zerst ren
655701 you know its not about you its about your country
655702 this weeks recap of songs is posted in collaboration with other worship leaders on the
655703 i would cheat if i felt i was being cheated
655704 the concept of cheating is based on the false assumption that the system is legitimate and there is something wrong with the individual whos doing it
655705 thats too easy an answer weve got to start looking at the system
655706 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
655707 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
655708 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
655709 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
655710 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
655711 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
655712 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
655713 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
655714 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
655715 it was made into a bad movie in the 1970s starring the admirable george c scott
655716 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
655717 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
655718 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described
655719 it used to have a four cylinder flathead chrysler diesel engine but someone replaced it with a v8 general motors gasoline car engine it turned the boat into a virtual bomb it looked like a bucket of rusty bolts so i sent some guys to move it to a good boatyard
655720 it was 12 knots on a boat which was not seaworthy after a nine hour journey we navigated in by torchlight to the new yard
655721 we will then take her to an undisclosed location and protect her like an unborn child
655722 but it means that you will see 27m of the 32m on the screen there are certain things that are meant to be and if youre lucky enough in life to eventually get there then that is a great achievement this is the project that is meant to be for me
655723 i put a lot of myself in to those roles
655724 in the valley of elah was an important film because we were looking at how the iraq war impacts on local communities across america with the loss of family members its a tragedy that carries on
655725 he is so focused tommy never wants to waste time and sometimes we were having a bit too much fun for him
655726 my belief is that we should never waste a day
655727 and when you are working and acting is our work there should be total concentration on what you are trying to achieve anything less than that then you are cheating yourself and short changing others
655728 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
655729 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
655730 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
655731 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
655732 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
655733 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
655734 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different

655738 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
655739 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
655740 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
655741 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
655742 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
655743 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
655744 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
655745 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
655746 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
655747 he just said we need to do all these things
655748 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
655749 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
655750 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
655751 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
655752 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
655753 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
655754 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
655755 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
655756 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
655757 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge

655761 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
655762 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
655763 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
655764 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
655765 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
655766 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
655767 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
655768 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
655769 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
655770 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
655771 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
655772 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
655773 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
655774 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
655775 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
655776 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
655777 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
655778 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
655779 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
655780 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
655781 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
655782 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
655783 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
655784 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
655785 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
655786 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
655787 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
655788 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
655789 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
655790 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
655791 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
655792 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
655793 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
655794 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
655795 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
655796 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
655797 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
655798 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
655799 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
655800 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
655801 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
655802 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
655803 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
655804 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
655805 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
655806 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
655807 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
655808 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
655809 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
655810 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
655811 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
655812 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
655813 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
655814 i do believe that his goals and his priorities and the visibility that hes given the issue has been good for america and the world
655815 it drives the talk radio crowd nuts when mccain does not wage war on pelosi and gore
655816 at some point the mccain campaign has to make congress and the democratic majority an issue in this campaign its something mccain has to wrestle with
655817 the bad performance of the congress the reason why the approval rating is 9 to 14 percent the second is what they want to do when obama comes into office
655818 he has to get rougher and his problem in the election is the gop brand
655819 you have to fight fire with fire he should say if the republican brand aint so hot then what about the democratic brand
655820 first instinct is not to go negative or go to the punch he tends to pull the punch
655821 hes got two challenges ahead of him obama is hovering close to 40 to 50 percent in the polls and has to be dragged down and mccain is in the low 40s and has to be pumped up
655822 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
655823 if the late house speaker tip oneill and president ronald reagan could then certainly john mccain and nancy pelosi can i think shes been very effective
655824 i have said the states should decide and gov schwarzenegger has made his position clear so has speaker pelosi
655825 one of the things i would do is offer them a higher share of the revenues there are certain budgetary problems that exist as we all know
655826 its their coastal waters and i would offer them more of the revenues
655827 gov schwarzenegger has made his position clear the governor of florida has had a different position one of the things i would do is offer coastal states a higher share of the revenues there are certain budgetary problems that exist as we all know its their coastal waters and i would offer them more of the revenues
655828 i would push for federal action to carry out a federal responsibility and a federal responsibility is immigration if you have secure borders and you have a temporary worker program that has to do with tamper proof biometric documents you address the issue of the 12 million people who are here illegally and you dont have to worry about all that
655829 i dont think its doable without nuclear power i do believe we can become energy independent but i think it will involve nuclear power wind solar it requires all those things including offshore drilling
655830 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
655831 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
655832 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
655833 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
655834 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
655835 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
655836 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
655837 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
655838 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
655839 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
655840 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
655841 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
655842 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
655843 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
655844 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
655845 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
655846 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
655847 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
655848 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
655849 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
655850 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
655851 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
655852 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
655853 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
655854 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
655855 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
655856 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
655857 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
655858 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
655859 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
655860 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
655861 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
655862 they have to settle all their differences otherwise it will lead to a crisis in all iraqi cities
655863 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
655864 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city

655867 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do
655868 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
655869 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
655870 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
655871 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
655872 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
655873 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
655874 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
655875 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
655876 i think we should be in a post racial environment
655877 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
655878 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
655879 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
655880 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons amp dragons
655881 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
655882 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
655883 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
655884 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
655885 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
655886 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
655887 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
655888 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
655889 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
655890 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
655891 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
655892 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
655893 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

655896 and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying what seest thou and i said i see a seething pot and the face thereof is toward the north
655897 then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city which say it is not near let us build houses this city is the cauldron and we be the flesh
655898 and utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto them thus saith the lord god set on a pot set it on and also pour water into it gather the pieces thereof into it even every good piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones take the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under it and make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it therein wherefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to the pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it bring it out piece by piece let no lot fall upon it
655899 this city is the cauldron and we be the flesh
655900 we might soon face challenges last seen during the onset of the great depression

655902 also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents i have not found it by secret search but upon all these
655903 obama has deep faith in lord hanuman and that is why we are presenting an idol of hanuman to him
655904 ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you i am the lord
655905 but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken

655910 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
655911 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
655912 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
655913 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
655914 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
655915 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
655916 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
655917 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
655918 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
655919 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
655920 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
655921 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
655922 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
655923 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
655924 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
655925 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
655926 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
655927 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
655928 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
655929 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
655930 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
655931 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
655932 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
655933 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
655934 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
655935 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
655936 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
655937 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
655938 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record

655941 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
655942 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
655943 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
655944 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
655945 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
655946 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
655947 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
655948 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
655949 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
655950 there were lots of girls waiting to go in and i was really nervous some of them were really pretty and i kept thinking to myself how am i going to beat these girls and i kept drinking cup after cup of coffee to try and calm myself down by the time they called me into the interview room i was desperate for a pee and i didnt have time to go to the bathroom anyway i get into the room and it was filled with these four blokes all staring at me they told me to undress so they can have a good look so i start stripping i was so desperate to pee that i must have been rushing as they kept telling me to slow down i really wanted to make a good impression so i just bit my tongue about needing the toilet and kept on going i had just got my tits out for them to have a good look when i just couldnt hold back any i told the man behind the desk that i was really sorry and i really needed the bathroom and explained how much i wanted to get in and begged them not to hold it against me then one of other men told me that if i wanted the bathroom then i should go right there and then in front of them normally i would have told him where to go but i was on the verge of pissing myself anyway and having all these blokes admiring my body with my tits on display just kind of triggered the response within seconds i was squirting my pee into my panties feeling them go all hot and damp as my piss streamed into them i was so embarrassed but then one of the blokes starting clapping as my pee started to run down my legs i couldnt believe it they were actually enjoying seeing me pee myself the guy behind the desk was leaning forwards for a better look and the other three had all moved closer all so they could witness my panties getting wetter and wetter as my pee soaked right through them
655951 ok so im stood half naked in this room with four blokes watching me take a piss in my panties by now my underwear is all soaked yellow and streams of pee are running down my legs there was a large stain on the carpet where my pee had run off my feet and i was still in mid flow i had never needed to pee as badly as i did then and it felt so incredible to simply let go the man behind the desk suddenly told me it was time to take off my panties and i tried to explain that i wasnt done peeing he said that that was why he had asked as he wanted to see my golden spray as it squirted out of my cunt i had no choice to oblige so i quickly slid my sodden panties down my legs and stood up now i was embarrassed again my piss stream was still flowing out of my pussy and going everywhere the stain i had made earlier on the carpet was nothing compared to the mess i was making now i thought i had blown the interview until the boss man behind the desk gave me a massive smile and told me i was in all he wanted to see now was for me to hold my pussy flaps tight to try and control my piss spray he wanted to see how far i could reach with pee stream and wanted to know if i was to piss on film for him
655952 but honey just think of it all you have to do is take a pee you do it several times a day anyway so why not let somebody else have some by watching
655953 but i just dont think i can do it in front of others
655954 how about me honey do you think you could take a leak with me watching
655955 yes i think i could do it in front of you but youre my friend and it wouldnt be the same

656004 i talked to hosts communications and they offered a 50 50 split on any business nelligan offered us a bigger deal this was a no brainer
656005 not true the first contract had a three year term if we hit a benchmark so if we hit a benchmark of success that was significantly higher than where we started we automatically got three more years
656006 the thing that gets lost is nobodys writing us a check from rutgers
656007 were writing rutgers checks for significantly more money than theyve ever had before and were also underwriting the expenses of radio broadcast time the cost of producing coaches radio and television shows and signage production those expenses are paid for out of the corporate sponsorship that weve generated
656008 and now theyve raised that bar at over 4 million
656009 so they outsource this task to a sports marketing entity like ours that has a better chance to get in with a ceo of a major fortune 500 company
656010 i believe that the corporate revenue will continue to increase and continue to help offset expenses and continue to add more value for rutgers
656011 our job is to maximize revenue and exposure for the university and weve done a terrific job of doing that

656172 this has created an opportunity for the chairperson to make decisions on management issues ranging from the employment and re employment of different categories of managers interference and open bias in the matter concerning the suspension and investigation of snuki zikalala head of sabc news
656173 it has become extremely difficult and unbearable for some executives to focus on the operations of the sabc and to implement the strategy of the organisation
656174 but well take it anyway weve been working hard at the tackle breakdown this past week and it paid dividends
656175 they hit us hard at the breakdown and their defence was strong
656176 it was a fine team effort its only halfway through the season theres still a long way to go
656177 it was like little loftus when we ran out it was really fantastic
656178 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
656179 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
656180 if they can capitalise on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
656181 senator obama is an impressive orator and its a lucky thing for me that people arent just choosing a motivational speaker
656182 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
656183 it seems to me the only thing he wants us to do is inflate tires
656184 what john mccain has done in the last week has really shown the american people he doesnt want to talk about the economy or foreign policy or healthcare
656185 i am not going to pretend that shoddy treatment of pikoli means the end of democracy or anything as hyperbolic as that but i do say its very serious
656186 it would be an unforgivable injustice to a good man he is one of our best we are privileged to have public servants of the calibre of mr pikoli he is highly principled sometimes he might be pedantic and therefore rub people up the wrong way but we badly need government officers like him
656187 that is an unexplained event it is unconstitutional and unlawful it is in fact a criminal instruction in terms of the npa act
656188 we simply dont know how this came about because the minister has never explained it to us and only she can
656189 what we do know is that this was the beginning of the end
656190 over the years weve received thousands of letters from fans around the world wishing they could visit hogwarts and the wonderful locations described in each of j k rowlings beloved stories

656208 lol good guess no sweetheart not a chastity belt i said something you wanted

656221 ive never met someone where my feelings fluctuate as much every day as they do with you
656222 our position is firm there will be no cooperation with the so called international criminal court
656223 the correct position for the au therefore should be to investigate ourselves
656224 these colonial superpowers are waging a targeted campaign against our country
656225 as per our information 30 children and 38 women have been killed
656226 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is compete we will investigate the cause
656227 si queremos desarrollar un pa s productivo como lo se ala la constituci n de la rep blica bolivariana de venezuela debemos reconsiderar el papel fundamental que juegan las cooperativas en la construcci n de un nuevo modelo econ mico propio
656228 como pueblo latinoamericano y caribe o tenemos un extraordinario momento pol tico una coyuntura que tiene 19 a os de transici n la cual comenz con los acontecimientos de febrero de 1989 y no ha cerrado a n esa coyuntura pari a la revoluci n bolivariana y al liderazgo del presidente hugo ch vez una revoluci n democr tica popular pero esencialmente antiimperialista con un horizonte socialista
656229 es necesario una revisi n un reordenamiento estrat gico porque en el movimiento cooperativo nacional de acuerdo a la jornada que hemos venido realizando hay una necesidad de empuje hacia el socialismo el cooperativismo tiene posibilidad en el desarrollo de una sociedad socialista que en la estructura econ mica del capitalismo no es posible
656230 today i have decided to stand down as england captain to be honest it is the hardest decision i have ever had to make but also the easiest
656231 i am giving away the job i have loved for five years put my heart and soul into the job but my mind has told me to pack it in
656232 i feel if i kept going as captain my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this decision will prolong my career i am going to carry on playing i believe there are a lot more runs in me i hope this decision will help that
656233 ya tenemos 10 estados donde se logr una alianza perfecta y tengo la absoluta convicci n de que el lunes se va a anunciar luego de la reuni n otro importante n mero de estados donde tambi n habr una alianza perfecta

656235 a common strategy to overcome the challenges posed to the security and stability of both countries by terrorism and extremism
656236 afghanistan has long accused the pakistan spy agency of backing the taliban led insurgency wracking the country it also has complained repeatedly that pakistan based militants are crossing the border to launch terrorist attacks in afghanistan
656237 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is complete we will investigate the cause
656238 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now
656239 as per our information 30 children and 38 women have been killed
656240 lets look at the pros and cons do a quick calculation and make a decision
656241 we are pleased our rates of healthcare acquired infections remain relatively low for both clostridium difficile and mrsa
656242 this along with the fact that recently released healthcare commission figures show that since 2007 our mrsa rates are the lowest they have been for six years indicates we are certainly proving successful in our bid prevent infection in our hospitals
656243 however despite recently having almost a two month period where our hospitals were mrsa free even one case is a case too many and a stark reminder to staff visitors and patients the importance of following our infection control guidance

656350 there was still a lot of challenging work involved especially with those extremely large boulders they required blasting
656351 fortunately everything went along real quickly the blasting work the final scaling of the rockface wall and they threw a lot of crews and equipment at it and it all fell into place
656352 staff are absolutely confident they would not have gone in to remove that debris if they hadnt been 100 per cent confident of the rock face
656353 that rock face along with other areas along the corridor will continue to be monitored now that a whole lot of that rock has been released it probably makes it a little bit more safer in a perfect world wed do it in a more controlled fashion but there was nothing to suggest that a slide of this magnitude was going to happen

656390 what i did is nag 50 50 ako at hindi ako nag overboard tulad ng palagi kong ginagawa pero siyempre ano rin hindi ako magdi disappoint ng mga taong nag aabang naghihintay ng gimmick sa tingin ko hindi ko naman sila nabigo dahil wala naman po akong naririnig na masama
656391 ako po personally hindi po ako nakikipagkumpitensiya kasi ako po bago po ako makipagkumpitensiya gusto ko munang maayos ang trabaho ko bago ko makipag compete sa kanila gusto ko na maayos ko muna ang trabaho ko at yun naman ang tinitingnan ko palagi ang trabaho ko
656392 siyempre meron may healthy competition pero more than anything else ako kasi ayoko ng nakikipagkumpitensiya dahil nakakaragdag lang ng pressure siyempre kapag nagko compete ka masyado kang nagmamadali at the end of the day madarapa ka rin sa kakamadali mo mas mainam na yung iniisip mo lang kung ano ang kailangan mong gawin
656393 basta ako masayang masaya na ako sa naging reaction ng tao sa akin at masaya ako dahil nandoon ang nanay ko tatay ko first time nila kong nakita sa ganoong klase ng environment at pag uwi ko naman proud naman sila sa akin
656394 at maging ang mga tao sa abs they called me they said it was a good show at least daw hindi ako sumobra masaya everyone was happy
656395 may nabasa nga ako sa isang diyaryo na laos na daw kami nina sam milby nina diether ocampo ang sa akin lang hindi ako mag e elaborate kung tinilian ako or hindi
656396 naiintindihan ko naman na hinahanap nila ang ginawa ko dati pero naging test din naman po sa akin ito na at the end of the day parang siyempre nandoon yung question sa utak ko na baka tinitilian lang nila ako dahil naghubad ako
656397 kung meron man nagsasabi na kinarma ako sa bench fashion show nagpapasalamat ako dahil napakaganda ng karma ko nung gabing yun dahil lahat ng gusto kong mangyari ay nangyari nung gabing yun
656398 well all i could say is im happy with what happened with bench i gave my best and i gave my 100 at na appreciate ko po ang suporta ng gabing yun sa araneta
656399 do not rush take cover quietly the others will do the same
656400 we do not have any strikers apart from wayne rooney and carlos tevez and frazier plays in that area he is a progressive young player he is quick and determined and he can do very well in the game
656401 what is interesting is that newcastle are still following skjelbred and are preparing to lodge a 4 5m bid for him if their bigger transfer targets slip out of their hands
656402 which is also why skjelbred is putting off signing a new deal with rosenborg
656403 he does not want to make things messy if newcastle or another club he might find interesting comes in for him before the end of the transfer window
656404 all the clubs from the big leagues have been watching him
656405 so far what i can say is that nobody from newcastle has come to me
656406 he is very ambitious and if newcastle came to us with an offer then we would have to seriously consider it

656426 as far as were concerned nick is a lifer with this organization hes not going anywhere at all
656427 weve simply taken the position of founding director and split it in two so we will now have a chief curator and an executive director as the two most senior management positions nick is going to be the chief curator because its important that he be able to spend 100 percent of his attention in this area there is no one more qualified for this job than nick
656428 thanks to nicks tireless and dedicated leadership weve been successfully founded and now were ready to move on to the next phase its a function of our growth and our success that wherever possible we need to move away from people having to do multiple functions that cant be reasonably and effectively accomplished by one person which is so common in a start up operation to allow people to focus on their strengths and areas of expertise
656429 as we quietly grew to 25 full time employees the administration was getting sufficiently complex and time consuming i was also beginning to spend a lot of time on the road so the opportunity to focus on curatorial and programming affairs was a welcome relief and allows me to sail into my dotage doing what i truly love
656430 nick is still functioning as hes always functioned there is no vacancy so were going to hire the new person as soon as we can find the perfect candidate for the job

656462 it was the last thing on my mind which is usually the case when you hit a home run

656481 finally i was at a loss to explain how this box improves upon the time warner dvr he already has except for tivotogo and a number of minor features that allow him to pull video off of the tivo for later use which is really all he wanted to do all i could recommend was getting the humax dvd burning tivo not a rousing advertisement for the dt sure it has an ethernet port and sure the little wireless adapter they sent us to play with is cool looking but i cant recommend this as an upgrade for current tivo users nor can i recommend this to a first time tivo user the analog rf cable tuner is just not useful enough to consider this an upgrade tivo users are a long suffering and patient lot they accept buggy annoying installs and land line dial up setups they play with tv inputs so they can record one show and watch another at the same time they change cable channels so they can watch hd content and record it at the same time they work around tivos many limitations and still stand by the product like a battered hillbilly yelling at the police on cops to leave her man be he wouldnt hurt nobody give us series 3 or give us death for many far too many in fact the cable companys hd ready dvr is getting more and more tempting and that is a sad sad fact

656491 jake is telling everyone they are getting married at christmas

656494 john believed in the jessica simpson thats within he cherished our love he helped make me the woman i am today john is going to be an amazing man for someone but i know that i was supposed to be with someone else
656495 its kind of like being date raped which i liked
656496 if he wants to retract that it would be nice for the 9 000 people who have been drug raped in the past 12 years

656499 i am in love with ronnie i should hope hes in love with me we didnt mean to fall in love you cant choose who you fall in love with people fall in love despite an age gap i fancy him because of the person he is i dont think about his age or the fact hes a rolling stone
656500 it was natural it just happened ive never felt more connected to someone
656501 no one would understand our relationship its really intense yeah we are boyfriend and girlfriend
656502 it was a bit simpler and more direct when i was starting to grow up i think what was prevalent at least what my brother was listening to was what was laughingly called progressive rock and thats when i decided that my tastes were rather more retrogressive
656503 as writers there are people like sam cooke who certainly had a concept
656504 in a literary sense sam cooke was one of the few that really was a writer of course when i was growing up i got different stuff to say from what he has i have to write from a more general perspective i could never have written a change is gonna come because that really is a black mans song it would sound a bit phony for me to try to write something with that exact point of view
656505 i guess if push comes to shove i would describe myself as coming out of the blues r amp b side of the spectrum
656506 but i mean if you play the saxophone you certainly cant escape the influence of jazz also i have a great respect for the idiom of jazz and i dont feel that my vocabulary is as strong as some of the other players who operate in the idiom
656507 and it has the low string of the viola which i really love but its small enough that i can handle it easily
656508 cindy and i love to play swedish and norwegian traditional fiddle tunes in which the fiddlers play in harmony with each other
656509 its a beautiful sound and you can get four part harmonies going with just two people
656510 i was playing around with the number 52 and thinking what can i do with that
656511 and then realized i can divide it by four and you get 13 so i decided to write a song that had 13 beats per measure and four measures in each section and then youd have 52 beats in each section of the piece
656512 he was also too cheap to buy me a present
656513 we also put a few jokers in added a few measures with 14 beats we really advise people not to try to count it can kind of spoil a day
656514 the roots of traditional music go way back sometimes many generations
656515 but its a continuous lineage that has never stopped its an unbroken living tradition that is going through a golden age right now where people are learning the older tunes and then creating new tunes that enter back into the tradition its totally relevant to us and reaching out and understanding people in other cultures
656516 producer rick rubin called me to ask how id feel if johnny cash covered hurt i said id be very flattered but was given no indication it would actually be recorded
656517 two weeks went by then i got a cd in the post i listened to it and it was very strange it was this other person inhabiting my most personal song hearing it was like someone kissing your girlfriend it felt invasive
656518 having johnny cash one of the greatest singer songwriters of all time wants to cover your song thats something that matters to me its not so much what other people think but the honour that this guy felt it was worthy of interpreting
656519 he said afterwards it was a song that sounds like one he would have written in the 60s and thats wonderful
656520 im sad this incident happened because it interrupted a beautiful and loving party im happy none of my people or friends got hurt and the party continues
656521 tori asked the producers to find a spot for him maybe a guest starring role that could turn into something permanent
656522 tori would love to work with dean on 90210 they could carpool to the set and bring their kids
656523 theyre just going to keep trying so we need to raise awareness of the bill and the problems with it and educate congress about how extremely controversial it is
656524 melanie stokes would be extremely dishonored by this bill because if it hadnt been for all of the drugs and electroshock she was given she wouldnt be dead today her child would have a mother
656525 it is pretty obvious to me that this bill is to get more women to take drugs
656526 the groups that are pushing this also frequently talk about how the drugs are safe for mothers who are pregnant or breastfeeding they just totally downplay it
656527 they want to screen every woman that they can find
656528 its really frightening they even mention case management and transportation services in the bill it sounds like they will send out social workers to your house to ask you questions its really frightening to think that they could use their subjective tests and determine that you are an unfit parent

656530 weve had a wonderful mission and a very eventful one in terms of the scientific discoveries weve made and yet an uneventful one when it comes to the spacecraft behaving so well

656532 i am honored and humbled to be able to work with such a scientifically rich mission and with the outstanding scientists and engineers who are the backbone of cassini
656533 i too wanna be a star like my big sister
656534 is a family oriented country and a woman cannot realistically live by herself so instead of separating the best thing is to give the man counseling

656539 almost everyday i have a patient come in or e mail me telling me how great they feel i always knew that this type of treatment would be successful on the physical side i never imagined the impact it would have on my patients overall sense of well being i have happy and healthy patients living really vibrant lives
656540 i want to see my male patients 2 3 times a year in my office and my female patients 4 5 times a year no matter how well they are doing
656541 since we see our patients across multiple visits and over a longer period of time we were able to substantially reduce our rates and fees to accommodate the expansiveness of the program protocol in other offices this one of a kind treatment could cost a fortune
656542 but at doctors age management centers our main goal is to make dr stocks program accessible and affordable to almost anyone
656543 after the sale cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash
656544 the true surprise is that america has not simply turned its back on de palmas war film it has turned its back on all iraq war films
656545 its also noteworthy that the fog last night was insane even for a san francisco local
656546 then i started this shot which was about 2 minutes long followed by 2 minutes of noise reduction again so by the time i had my shot it was too late for a do over so this is it i only got to take one photo and this is what i got so i hope it worked out
656547 capturing a shot like this is tricky because the lens itself actually rotates which looks great but is tough for long exposures but for the first 5 minutes they leave it static to indulge all of the photographers who turn out and want this shot this highly unique and one of a kind shot of course when they switched to this light my camera still had about a minute of noise reduction to do on my final test shot to get the exposure right so i missed the first minute then i started this shot which was about 2 minutes long followed by 2 minutes of noise reduction again so by the time i had my shot it was too late for a do over so this is it i only got to take one photo and this is what i got so i hope it worked out

656561 appare sempre pi grande quasi sovrumano il merito di paolo vi nel presiedere il concilio
656562 vita amicizia e amore sono regalo di dio non si comprano
656563 il sole e la sua luce laria che respiriamo lacqua la bellezza della terra lamore lamicizia la vita stessa ha detto il papa sono beni centrali
656564 non possiamo comprarli ma ci sono donati ci sono cose ha aggiunto che nessuno ci pu portare via che nessuna dittatura nessuna forza distruttrice ci pu rubare
656565 quale supremo pastore della chiesa paolo vi ha detto il papa guid il popolo di dio alla contemplazione del volto di cristo redentore delluomo e signore della storia
656566 e proprio lamorevole orientamento della mente e del cuore verso cristo fu uno dei cardini del concilio vaticano ii un atteggiamento fondamentale che il venerato mio predecessore giovanni paolo ii eredit e rilanci nel grande giubileo del 2000 al centro di tutto sempre e solo cristo al centro delle sacre scritture e della tradizione nel cuore della chiesa del mondo e dellintero universo
656567 come non ringraziare il signore per la sua feconda e coraggiosa azione pastorale man mano che il nostro sguardo sul passato si fa pi largo e consapevole appare sempre pi grande quasi sovrumano il merito di paolo vi nel presiedere lassise conciliare nel condurla felicemente a termine e nel governare la movimentata fase del post concilio
656568 ha valorizzato le sue spiccate doti di intelligenza e il suo amore appassionato alla chiesa e alluomo

656588 unfortunately im in an industry where diversity is not celebrated the way it should be when some people see and hear something different it feels foreign to them and they dont like that everyone has a choice of what they like and thats a beautiful thing but record labels managers publicist journalist media etc have a tendency to see something work and try to reciprocate that with another artist thinking thats what makes success to me what makes success is letting people be truly who they are when i heard kanyes everything i am i instantly fell in love i felt my story somewhere in his i felt his frustration yet acceptance of who he was so i decided to put my own little twist on it

656603 there are 12 000 independent pubs in the uk and they should all be selling mutton they are lucky in that they can bypass the big supply chains and deal with the farmers directly

656630 we took the mash that would normally go to an ethanol plant and ran it through our system low and behold we got more fermentable sugars out of it
656631 what weve found with miscanthus is that the amount of biomass generated each year would allow us to produce about 2 1 2 times the amount of ethanol we can produce per acre of corn
656632 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
656633 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass

656692 as to whether this shooting this morning is gang related it is much too early to say
656693 had major operations against the avenues gang and the cypress park gang

656720 die chinesen scheinen einzusehen dass freiheit und menschenrechte die beste basis f r eine gute zukunft sind

656734 i have examined all the known superstitions of the word and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the world the clergy converted the simple teachings of jesus into an engine for enslaving mankind to filch wealth and power to themselves they in fact constitute the real anti christ

656738 every year is a different year we want to see our players that did well the year before do even better it all comes down to making sure were putting them in the best position to make plays thats what we try to do
656739 this game is ever evolving you go back and you look at what you did last year and you want to build on it
656740 then you look back on what you didnt do well and then you start doing some research youre always trying to stay ahead or catch up to what the defense is going
656741 were looking forward to having all those guys for the offense
656742 it always goes down to the same thing how the defense is going to perceive those players how theyre going to try to defend those players
656743 if theyre the ones theyre trying to defend the other players have to get open so everything really complements itself the good thing is that we have a quarterback that can find the open target
656744 i think we did really well especially on the d line
656745 we made some plays and got after the quarterback weve got some wrinkles to iron out but it was a pretty good day
656746 it feels good to make any plays out here youre in the nfl now not in college anymore whenever you get a chance to make a play to help your team it always feels good i think i personally had two sacks i dont think they gave me one but it was obviously a sack in my opinion

656751 jon and i get along fine playing the same position we talk things over how you see something if you can help each other on a certain key you see and work that back and forth its only going to make you a better player
656752 i knew he wasnt going to go you know its the 10th or 11th day out here more like a game situation its still not like a game you get a little simulation but its good to come out and try to make plays and execute what youve been learning
656753 i cut to the middle of the field and whenever i see a crease i take it
656754 i saw the open field and i saw the green grass and i took it
656755 i think i went out and did everything i could do to show the coaches ive improved since ive been with the new orleans saints and im ready to play some football i can be a guy they can depend on to make some plays i made the plays when they were there to be made the return meant a lot to me it showed the coaches im going to be a return guy but i think i also showed them i can play wide receiver

656821 it was what you did in them days different world now
656822 he wasnt a bad catch your dad steady job not bad looking and hed asked me you didnt pass up your chances so easily back then they might not come again
656823 he used to get me four bars of chocolate every friday
656824 i remember him fetching you home that bloody rocking horse flicka you called it awful old thing with rusty springs somebody had knocked hell out of it before you ever saw it and you carried on
656825 i did and you were a bossy little thing too standing there next to me in your frilly apron making grey jam tarts you used to eat most of the pastry before it ever got near an oven will you fetch me my chair love and an ice cream

656828 no its bloody not all right ive been working my backside off for years so she could get somewhere seven grand a year that school cost and now shes going to give up selfish little madam have you any idea how many people she beat to get a place she could have done anything she wanted and now
656829 i know you were love right from when she was little ive never seen anybody make so much fuss over a kiddy acting a mince pie in a school nativity
656830 its not worth crying over love its her choice let her get on with it
656831 no wonder she sent me a text she knew what shed get if she spoke to me directly
656832 so long as shes happy thats all that matters you cant live your kids lives for them much as youd like to
656833 now then im not having you talking like that theres some revels in that bag go and have a look
656834 youre not the only one who likes them have a look
656835 most things look better with a sweet in your mouth
656836 why cant she ring her bloody father ive no idea whats the matter with her let him try to sort her out if he can
656837 i dont think geoffery will be sending me any potatoes mother
656838 roast potatoes are my favourites mind have to get them eaten straight away out of the oven onto your plate and into your mouth arthur used to say
656839 the foods all right its the miserable old sods you have to eat it with that are the problem
656840 some of them are a lot worse off than you
656841 its life and you have to make the best of it not sit there sniping we can all do that im upright and im breathing theres plenty in the grave would swap places with me
656842 i told one woman to shut her face the other day
656843 what are you going to do about our sarah then
656844 not much i can do about it if she wants to mess up her life thats her privilege
656845 course you can do something about it when did you last see her
656846 a month or so ago its been manic at work and shes been busy
656847 far as i know she wasnt going to tell me if there was something wrong
656848 rubbish of course she hasnt had enough she just thinks she has they all go through it
656849 i didnt show you my book did i you want to have a read of it when you get fed up of your bits of paper
656850 its called bride of the rat god devious little buggers them rats
656851 they have all sorts over there beggars cant be choosers whats she going to do if she packs it in then
656852 when we were first married we used to go to the lakes every spring and autumn to see the leaves sometimes thered be a bus trip up onto the moors or somewhere with a bit of scenery i didnt mind it but i like my own bed at night
656853 i said she had to do what she liked do what made her happy
656854 i told her to stick it out that she were just as good as any of them and it would all sort itself out
656855 you dont listen and on top of that she was terrified of letting you down
656856 i cant not until the weekend ive a presentation to do tomorrow and the rest of next week is booked solid with meetings
656857 well i think its a poor do if you cant put your daughter first when she needs you
656858 i do put my daughter first who do you think pays her fees i am not being made to take the blame for this
656859 no you gave her what you wanted thats not quite the same thing when your gran first got the idea that arthur wanted to marry me she did her level best to get me to turn him down said he wasnt good enough she went on at me for weeks till i eventually flew at her and answered back i said he was good enough for me and thats all that mattered
656860 maybe not finishing the course and doing something different is good enough for our sarah you cant go on living your life for your kids sooner or later they have to live it for themselves as best they can
656861 we have it on in the mornings you could do worse than watch a bit of it
656862 i had to find my own way you took no interest at all
656863 i knew nowt about colleges or university what was i supposed to say
656864 go and see her blow your presentations and your meetings tell them youre poorly tell her you dont give a damn if she passes or fails then she just might do it and if you can get a square meal down her while youre there all the better
656865 sarah doesnt realise how lucky she is she had a damn sight better start in life than those kids down there are getting
656866 they look like theyre doing all right to me theyve been happy as larry all afternoon rolling around with their mum and dad like little puppy dogs getting spoilt

656871 climatic models generally fail to reproduce the long term changes on temperature and precipitation
656872 1 the models are poor 2 the data are poor 3 the modelled and observed time series are not comparable to each other 4 our calculations and comparisons are wrong
656873 at the annual and the climatic 30 year scales gcm global climate models interpolated series are irrelevant to reality gcms do not reproduce natural over year fluctuations and generally underestimate the variance and the hurst coefficient of the observed series the huge negative values of coefficients of efficiency show that model predictions are much poorer than an elementary prediction based on the time average this makes future climate projections at the examined locations not credible

656891 kamaruddin was arrested and has since been put on a train en route to karimganj in souther assam from where he would be pushed back to bangladesh through a border point
656892 the petitioner kamaruddin after successfully entering into assam from pakistan through bangladesh not only roamed around on indian soil but also contested the 1996 election from jamunamukh
656893 the petitioner was in possession of a passport issued by the pakistan government on the strength of which he travelled to dhaka from where he sneaked to assam and even contested the election this can happen only in assam
656894 we had pushed back kamaruddin twice once in 1998 and in 2000 but he managed to return and stayed with his wife and children at morajhar

656901 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
656902 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
656903 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
656904 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
656905 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
656906 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
656907 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
656908 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
656909 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
656910 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
656911 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
656912 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
656913 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
656914 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
656915 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
656916 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
656917 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
656918 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
656919 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
656920 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
656921 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
656922 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
656923 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
656924 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
656925 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
656926 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
656927 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
656928 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
656929 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
656930 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
656931 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
656932 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

656938 were contributing to a program we didnt want to see cut
656939 it isnt on mondays agenda but im going to ask the council to suspend the rules so we can talk about this
656940 this is a vital program that has been funded for many years and a lot of people depend on it
656941 we have quite a few people here that are wanting this dog pound back
656942 theres a lot of things that i think can be combined
656943 but i dont think a dog pound is one of them
656944 based on the information provided it appears that the neccog staff responded promptly and effectively in dealing with the complaint on july 4
656945 they kind of counteracted what we said like we werent telling the truth

656955 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
656956 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
656957 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
656958 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
656959 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
656960 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
656961 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
656962 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
656963 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
656964 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
656965 force big oil companies to take a reasonable share fo their record breaking windfall profits

656990 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
656991 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
656992 though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
656993 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

656996 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
656997 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
656998 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding by travers and milgram
656999 were trying to understand what is the chemistry of wet soil on mars whats dissolved in it how acidic or alkaline it is with the results we received from phoenix yesterday we could begin to tell what aspects of the soil might support life
657000 this is the first wet chemical analysis ever done on mars or any planet other than earth
657001 this soil appears to be a close analog to surface soils found in the upper dry valleys in antarctica
657002 the alkalinity of the soil at this location is definitely striking at this specific location one inch into the surface layer the soil is very basic with a ph of between eight and nine we also found a variety of components of salts that we havent had time to analyze and identify yet but that include magnesium sodium potassium and chloride
657003 this is more evidence for water because salts are there we also found a reasonable number of nutrients or chemicals needed by life as we know it
657004 over time ive come to the conclusion that the amazing thing about mars is not that its an alien world but that in many aspects like mineralogy its very much like earth
657005 the scientific data coming out of the instrument have been just spectacular
657006 at this point we can say that the soil has clearly interacted with water in the past we dont know whether that interaction occurred in this particular area in the northern polar region or whether it might have happened elsewhere and blown up to this area as dust
657007 we believe this is the best place for creating a profile of the surface from the top down to the anticipated icy layer
657008 this is the plan we wanted to do when we proposed the mission many years ago we wanted a place just like this where we could sample the soil down to the possible ice layer

657102 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
657103 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
657104 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
657105 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
657106 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow monday
657107 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
657108 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
657109 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
657110 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
657111 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
657112 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success

657116 we knew what gordons strengths were when people like me nominated him and supported him and it was his profound understanding of what this country needs
657117 anything that gets in the way of all of us as a team putting that message across effectively is a distraction from what needs to be done and is in danger of letting david cameron win by default
657118 we desperately need to find a way out of this mess and to end the personal dog fighting and to help restore some dignity to the standing of the labour party and our government
657119 during the next six months our military command in iraq should work to solidify the dramatic improvements in security achieved by united states soldiers over the past year transfer more responsibility to the iraqi army and encourage the maliki government to pursue further political reconciliation and economic revitalization continuing progress in each of these areas will allow additional troops to return home this year above and beyond the 26 300 that have been withdrawn since november of 2007
657120 the most meaningful significant progress in iraq is going to have to come from the iraqis themselves our men and women in uniform have performed exceptionally and have done all that has been asked of them but the next steps toward progress in iraq are largely internal with help from iraqs immediate neighbors a permanent american troop presence in iraq as the republicans advocate will only deepen iraqi dependence and continue diverting american attention from our primary threat from al qaida in the afghanistan pakistan border region
657121 peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none get the u s forces out of iraq
657122 as a united states senator i would never make a commitment to support the use of military force without fully assessing the conditions and actions that led to such a recommendation in the immediate future the united states should work aggressively with our european allies to implement strong and effective sanctions against both iran and those who support activities related to or benefiting their nuclear program
657123 rather than simply saber rattling i believe that we are stronger when we negotiate with our enemies from a position of strength and when we engage the international community we should begin direct hard nosed diplomatic talks with iran in concert with our european allies and as the fragile iranian economy continues to struggle economic leverage both carrots and sticks should continue to be one of the most powerful tools available to us
657124 if iran attacks the united states that requires a full retaliatory response
657125 all of our nato allies must recognize the critical strategic importance of denying terrorists a safe haven in afghanistan i believe that agreements to strengthen the isaf forces can and will be implemented without imposing sanctions or other restrictions on bilateral relations further progress can be made in our effort to isolate and defeat taliban and al qaida elements by making better use of the counterinsurgency tactics employed successfully in iraq
657126 we need to focus our efforts where the threat to our security is greatest and to do that we need to redeploy our troops out of iraq so that we have the resources to put troops into afghanistan the bush administrations attempts to bully others into supporting our agenda has not proven an effective foreign policy tool we should use a range of tools available to us including economic leverage and smarter more aggressive diplomacy to build consensus for putting additional allied troops into afghanistan
657127 the u s should fight the creeps behind the 9 11 attacks but i am not convinced they are in afghanistan
657128 a long term commitment of u s troops in an iraqi civil war is not in the interest of the u s iraq or the wider middle east
657129 we are there and we must finish what we started
657130 the military diplomatic and political progress would be squandered if we were to withdraw before iraq was ready to secure its own borders and protect its own cities
657131 congress needs to listen to our generals they have shown they have the expertise to assess well the military and political situation on the ground in iraq
657132 we should always remember that iraq is only one front of the global war on terror
657133 an iranian attack against israel would be a threat to peace in all regions of the world war is a last resort but if necessary i would support military action against iran they must know america is serious about protecting our allies and we cannot take anything off the table
657134 before i could support any military action i would need to be convinced not only that such action were in the national interest and in response to a clear threat but that there was a clear and achievable mission i have not yet seen such a mission described in iran
657135 if a diplomatic solution is not soon achieved the next congress and president may very well face a world crisis over an attack by israel to forestall nuclear weapons development in iran
657136 i will always act to protect the united states and american citizens we also have a responsibility to protect our allies especially our ally israel which has so often borne the brunt of irans violence and sponsorship of terrorism
657137 the united states must continue to work with our allies in diplomatic efforts with iran but also pursue tougher sanctions against the country and allow all options to remain on the table
657138 the war in iraq was a war of choice not a war of necessity our attention should have stayed in afghanistan
657139 the rise in violence and casualties in afghanistan have made it very apparent that additional troops are needed in the country
657140 the united states needs to encourage the nations in the region to have an open dialogue with each other the united states must act proactively by coordinating diplomatic political and economic solutions
657141 more troops from our nato allies would be very useful but it is even more important that to have a stable pakistan assisting our efforts in the region we cannot allow that government to fall to islamic radicals
657142 the resurgence of the taliban forces in afghanistan where they enjoy sanctuary status in the lawless portions of western pakistan must be broken in order for stability in that region to enjoy the same level of success as is being experienced in iraq
657143 we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life
657144 we need to speak life to each other and that means change
657145 we crawled to the border that was our solution and i think we stayed at the border for two or three hours until the army let the injured enter
657146 in my opinion hamas will quickly discover it committed a very big act of stupidity that will be difficult to resolve
657147 because its got no calories and yeah you try to watch your weight
657148 what we saw was that the more diet sodas a person drinks the more weight they were likely to gain
657149 when we would switch them on to diet soda off regular soda we werent seeing weight loss necessarily and that was confusing to us
657150 if im having one of those pig out days then yeah i figure maybe itll balance it out a little bit
657151 im drinking the diet soda and you know let me have that hamburger and fries instead of just the hamburger alone
657152 when i put anything to my stomach thats not water then my stomach responds by increasing the gastric acid secretion
657153 does that increase my sense of hunger and does that drive me to eat more
657154 you know much the same as when we went through the fat free craze people overate not because there was anything wrong with the products but they overate
657155 so were wondering are we seeing a similar phenomenon with the diet soda

657167 its very important for the citizens of texas to remember that jose medellin brutally and viciously gang raped stomped kicked slashed strangled and murdered two teenage girls in houston
657168 the world court has no jurisdiction here in texas were concerned about following texas law and thats what were doing
657169 if the world sees us ignoring the rights of foreign nationals arrested here there is very little reason for them to recognize the rights of u s citizens

657236 i e mailed or spoke with people who owned a thousand or more domains
657237 like most people in the business my wife thought i was crazy wasting time and money on domains
657238 however she now understands how good its been that i stuck with domains
657239 in the first six months of 2008 total reported sales in the domain aftermarket rose 11 6 percent over the first half of 2007 when the overall economy was in dramatically better condition than it is now
657240 because so many traditional businesses are moving online to take advantage of the cost savings and global reach
657241 you can definitely do it part time and in fact i think thats the best way to start
657242 this business is open to people from all financial backgrounds a domain costs less than 10 most places so you can start with very little those who already have a lot of money can afford to buy more attractive assets right away but others can certainly build up to the major player level over the years ive seen many people become millionaires
657243 yes you can earn a lot of money with the right investments
657244 but first you have to put the hours in you should do a lot of research follow popular domaining forums and domain news blogs and in general feel your way in
657245 saw an opportunity to invest in quality domains at the right time
657246 the thing you have to remember though is that due to the nature of the domain industry the road from the bottom to the top can be quick
657247 holds a significant portfolio of great one word and city domains
657248 i like americas country code us as a long term growth play with most good com domains long gone i can see small businesses in the u s utilizing their country code doing what their counterparts in europe asia and other parts of the world have already done
657249 the future will bring new domain name extensions and new investment opportunities
657250 personally i think it will have little impact at all
657251 especially on com which has been permanently branded into consumers minds through billions of dollars worth of corporate ad spending over the years
657252 when i was in the fight i prayed and i said to god to please let me do my dream

657259 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if they are found to be guilty will be brought to justice those who are proved innocent will be released

657261 the arab league calls for an end to the use of arms between brothers in the occupied palestinian territories

657335 the good of the public must be served ahead of nhs boards narrowly defined organisational interests placing them as servants of the community need and not its masters
657336 there is significant confusion and muddle in the dh and the nhs about the nature of governance it is not uncommon to hear senior figures talking about boards managing or leading their organisations this implies a fundamental lack of clarity about the explicit separation that should exist between the task of a board which is primarily legislative making policy setting strategic goals and holding the executive and through them the organisation to account and the task of the executive albeit some executives are also corporate directors within the legislative board which is to lead and manage the organisation so that policies are implemented strategic goals are achieved and the local community is served
657337 influenced by the work of whose model of policy governance is admirably clear and by good practice though by no means common practice in the private sector

657349 based on our experience the overwhelming reason for the ccp to block a website is not because it may have harmful content such as pornography or excessive violence

657580 becky was excited that she had been able to secure this job it was just what she wanted now she could begin to fulfil the potential she knew she had in her a movement caught her eye and she gazed out of the window still in a state of happy euphoria as her eyes focussed she sat bolt upright with shock the man getting into his car it couldnt be could it but yes it was it was graham her graham

657595 berry and davis will be involved in the overall strategic direction of the campaign and its community outreach efforts janet berry is a familiar and dedicated parent of children in davis schools and judy davis is the just retired principal of north davis elementary school
657596 it has been my great honor to be associated with davis schools for many years it is the involvement of parents volunteers and the extraordinary commitment of our entire community that has made davis public schools what they are today however it is really important for people to understand that state funding for schools is dropping and that there is a genuine gap between the cost of educating our students and funds from the state it is up to us to bridge the gap at stake is the range of diverse educational programs that are offered today preserving quality will be determined by a vote yes or no on measure w it is really that simple
657597 the immediate future for education funding in this state is at best unclear additional cuts are likely but no one knows with certainty at this time what we do know from our collective experience this past spring is that people in davis care about children they are committed to public education and they are willing to support important programs and teachers in all our schools what we learned during this period is that there is a structural budget problem in the district and we heard over and over that people expected a structural solution like a parcel tax thats what measure w is about and why im personally involved in the campaign voting yes for measure w will provide the long term protection for the classroom programs we saved this spring
657598 janet and judy have both demonstrated extraordinary leadership in their commitment to davis schools and protecting educational opportunities in our community we are really fortunate to have them involved in our community effort

657604 i could not count the dead i just glanced at once and i ran away for my life
657605 the somali government is a slave of the ethiopians and the so called president is an old puppet
657606 the aim of the resignations of the ministers is to create political instability in the country and disrupt the implementation of the djibouti agreement between the somali transitional government and the opposition in djibouti
657607 it is the right of any minister to render their resignation they can rest assured that their posts will be filled
657608 i have no plans to resign but if the parliament dissolves the government then i would accept i will also resign if that would help the peace process
657609 it had been there for many years and probably would be there for many more
657610 now i guess there might be more people making a pilgrimage to these glaciers before they go
657611 we could see similar scenes to the 1992 93 famine in which hundreds of thousands of people perished
657612 it suddenly turned the area into a carnage scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area
657613 there were pools of blood everywhere i have never seen such mass killing
657614 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president or mr universe
657615 um especialista nos deixou mas gra as a deus ele p de formar durante anos outros especialistas que infligir o duras perdas aos inimigos de deus e o vingar o ele e seus irm os
657616 we see the most fantastic growth opportunities of all time in the enterprise desktop value mail and collaboration business intelligence business applications the server market despite virtualization is still exploding enterprise search the move of enterprises to host their infrastructure in the cloud that we call microsoft online conferencing and ip telephony management virtualization software the database and database application platform i think palpably we are about this close microsoft able to claim that were the number one enterprise software company in the world which nobody would have been able to say 20 years ago and yet we see nothing but opportunity
657617 on 27 october 1992 allen schindler jr an american radioman petty officer third class in the united states navy was brutally murdered in a public bathroom in sasebo japan his family was only able to identify the body from the tattoos on his arms utilizing transcripts from the consequent trial of the defendants kenny mellman presents a chamber musical about homophobia murder the dont ask dont tell policy and the on again off again relationship between gay history and the public bathroom
657618 i saw little things that the coaches always try to point out
657619 we dont have huge guys out there but theyre all quick and athletic
657620 theyre playmakers those guys will always at least keep us in the game we feel like thats a good nucleus
657621 our defense is key but our success comes from how those two end up
657622 it has helped that they push one another they both realize that the other one has the talent to be a starter
657623 having one more year id say means having another opportunity
657624 and even if it is pressure thats ok were good with pressure
657625 everybody wants to crown the right champion were in the business to do things for kids
657626 philosophically though this is not where we want high school athletics to go do we do it for all games and what makes one contest more important than another that was part of the discussion and why it got complicated and why it failed
657627 most high schools do not have the adequate set up to really handle it
657628 everybody said you could do it at the georgia dome for football but we believe that any mechanism like this that you have for one game has to be used for all games we really dont believe the championship game is any more special in that regard than any game that gets you to the championship game
657629 the philosophical reason is it is a human sport that is played by humans coached by humans refereed by humans and just because a camera angle shows it one way isnt always proof that is the way it was
657630 what counts is how it looks to the official instant replay isnt what it is all that it is cracked up to be
657631 if the national federation said you must use instant replay we would do it
657632 estamos comprometidos com o di logo e queremos que seja colocado em pr tica em acordo com as leis e acabe em resultados pr ticos
657633 minha visita n o por causa do assunto nuclear mas o assunto nuclear sempre faz parte de qualquer conversa com as autoridades iranianas
657634 normal que perguntemos s autoridades iranianas sobre os detalhes de sua postura para responder a quest es sobre o assunto nuclear
657635 dad you should try and get even bigger muscles than you have so that when you make a muscle it will make a picture

657641 id like to make utmost efforts to make yamaguchi the no 1 prefecture in japan to live in
657642 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
657643 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
657644 as per our information 30 children and 38 women have been killed
657645 i saw an old women who lost two legs and a hand she was bleeding and later died before our eyes but we could do nothing as we ourselves needed help
657646 we do not have enough doctors and enough operational theaters it takes some time before all patients get access to emergency treatment
657647 they are lying in the corridors and some bled to death
657648 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is complete we will investigate the cause
657649 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now
657650 to prepare the ground for a framework for close and consultative engagement between the two countries to build confidence and develop a comprehensive strategy at the political military and intelligence levels
657651 a lot of steam has been let off the pressure cooker
657652 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
657653 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
657654 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
657655 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city
657656 i heard several days later from dr nishinas secretary that a domei reporter who was a friend of dr nishina delivered the truman document on the instructions of domei president inosuke furuno on the morning of aug 7 1945
657657 sixteen hours ago an american airplane dropped one bomb and destroyed its hiroshimas usefulness as a key military base to the enemy
657658 its always been a mystery how dr yoshio nishina knew that hiroshima had been hit with an a bomb before even going there it is possible that a domei reporter gave the copy of trumans statement to nishina the fact that the document was stored in nishinas office serves as irrefutable evidence
657659 this is the first time ive heard about this and its a major discovery
657660 i felt the war was over the moment i heard from dr nishina that he believed the bomb dropped on hiroshima was an a bomb
657661 in contrast to often dismal diplomacy in other areas bushs handling of china after a rough start has had some sense of nuance and statecraft
657662 it is essential that you unambiguously speak out for human rights and meet with the families of jailed prisoners of conscience while you are in beijing
657663 send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them
657664 the new estimates confirm that a vast majority of new infections in the u s occur in gay and bisexual men and that blacks are significantly more heavily impacted than other racial ethnic categories however the data fail to clearly link the two perpetuating a longstanding damaging polarization
657665 we need cdc to clearly show the hiv incidence numbers in gay men and other msm of color
657666 a substantial number of black people infected every year are gay or bisexual and a substantial proportion of gay and bisexual men infected are black in fact the heaviest impact is at the nexus of the two being both black and a man who has sex with men yet this population is significantly marginalized even stigmatized within both larger populations of which it is an integral part a national aids strategy must tackle this fundamental challenge
657667 the rising incidence in our communities is a direct result of years of policies and programs that demonize and ignore the sexual health needs of gay men especially african american and latino gay men who bear the brunt of the epidemic in the united states gay men of all colors face significant health disparities that directly impact the incidence and prevalence of hiv in their lives
657668 we must prioritize a holistic asset based gay mens health agenda that goes well beyond a navel to knee focus we must also address their physical mental emotional and spiritual health needs that when neglected foster conditions in which hiv thrives
657669 if this socially conservative country with far fewer resources than its wealthy neighbor to the north can ambitiously confront homophobia with government sponsorship and funding why cant the united states
657670 cdc talks of the need to develop more and better prevention messages including more prevention interventions for black gay men and gay men of all races but such strategies will never be sufficiently effective or taken up by those most at risk until and unless homophobia is directly confronted
657671 instead politicians of both parties and the department of health and human services have caved into pressure from right wing politicians squelching not only sexuality research but anti homophobia and pro sexual diversity messages in hiv prevention and general health promotion alike will our next administration buck this trend or will it be more of the business as usual thats decimating my community
657672 the heads of states or government while recalling u n security council resolution 1373 2001 emphasized the importance of criminalizing any act for the provision collection and acquisition of funds for the purpose of committing terrorist acts
657673 i firmly believe that the future of our association is bright
657674 we crawled to the border that was our solution and i think we stayed at the border for two or three hours until the army let the injured enter
657675 in my opinion hamas will quickly discover it committed a very big act of stupidity that will be difficult to resolve
657676 my wife was upset at what i had done i was so haunted by this weird experience
657677 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
657678 you can be mr lovely at home and then terrorize people on the way to work
657679 i tend not to honk at a large cadillac escalade with tinted windows that seems to have six people in it but if its a little old lady in a honda
657680 theres fewer vehicle miles traveled were seeing some speed reduction
657681 you wrote a blog on someone who had a quesion sic in the usa weekly and you profiled her and i cant imagine you could just
657682 just something so ordinary about it so no nonsense and no pretense about it
657683 instead of turning my lights off i littered and beat kittens same thing right
657684 depends on what you beat them with was it recyclable
657685 theres nothing new on meszaros i guess everyone has a feeling on the money they want
657686 at this point were not close to getting anything done
657687 braydon coburn had a ruptured artery which has been repaired

657710 declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work
657711 the cantarell oilfield in the shallow waters of the campeche bay is regarded in the mexican oil industry as the countrys crown jewel it is the worlds second largest oil field by production pumping about 2 2 million barrels of oil as much as every oil field in kuwait put together for that reason the news from petroleos mexicanos the state oil company that the fields production would begin to decline this year was met with dismay declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work

657722 economic models that have correctly predicted the winner of almost all post war u s presidential elections say recession fears will secure a victory for barack obama in november
657723 three separate studies showed the democratic presidential hopeful winning between 52 and 55 percent of the popular vote on november 4 based on current gloomy economic estimates

657732 the current system of classification comes from a time when video games were in their infancy
657733 the widespread recognition of the bbfcs classification categories in the uk and their statutory backing offer significant advantages which the pegi system lacks
657734 the pegi ratings system is the only one that truly protects children understands the interactive nature of rating games and is the only system endorsed by the games industry
657735 it offers a strict classification system based on international standards and detailed criteria which is scalable and robust enough to cope with rating the explosion of gaming content

657780 what we found 122 photos of obama have been published in the paper during that time to 78 for mccain counting tiny to big most of those photos ran inside the paper most on the politics page the page 1 photos are closer obama had nine to mccains seven five of obamas were above the fold mccain had four obama also got more color photos 72 to 49 and more large photos mostly those that spanned three or more columns 30 to 10
657781 part of obamas visual success in the post is due to three factors like them or not obama as phenomenon that hes photogenic and good photo opportunities but none of that gets the post off the hook for the mccain photo gap there is no post policy that the paper must run pictures of equal size and color and quality but there is the rule that everyone knows be fair
657782 but these kinds of discrepancies feed distrust on the part of readers especially conservative ones who already complain that the post is all for obama next week i will examine the stories

657856 industry officials and analysts have long claimed there is a lag of between seven and 10 days for changes in global oil prices to be reflected at the pump
657857 our price is pegged to the singapore price and when the prices go up the changes on the retail market are almost instantaneous in some cases but when the prices are coming down there is a significant time lag which cannot be explained they are basically gouging today taking profit at the expense of the motorists
657858 as of yesterday the price of the benchmark singapore tapas oil had fallen 16 per cent since its june highs during the same period the wholesale price of petrol offered by oil companies such as caltex and shell had only fallen 8 per cent while average retail prices had declined just 3 2 per cent a caltex spokeswoman claimed the company was following the same process on the upside as well as the downside

657867 great disappointment that the north carolina senate did not do the right thing to make sure that justice is carried out in north carolina when lives are at stake the senate had a chance to pass legislation that would begin to look at fairness when it comes to race in the death penalty and they deliberately chose to do nothing while we will work to win this bill again next year there is no guarantee that the senate leadership will allow this bill to be heard in the new year voters need to know that they are being heard by seeing how those who represent them truly stand on critical issues
657868 this bill was important in north carolina this year in light of the release of three innocent men from north carolinas death row in the past few months all three men were black it is important that we have a criminal justice system that is completely fair and this bill is the social remedy needed to begin to address this problem

657880 if there was security in the south why would we come here
657881 we will stay here even for 10 years until the bombardment ends
657882 there were armored vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
657883 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
657884 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
657885 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
657886 there was fighting in the village a hundred times roadside bombs bombardment firing and shooting
657887 the taliban are coming during the night with heavy weapons riding on vehicles and we cannot even dare ask them to leave because if they see someone at night outside they will slaughter them and accuse them of being spies
657888 it was really important for us to do our own version of the show
657889 naturally and i understand the confusion when it first started everyone was asking the kids who are you playing its not that world
657890 they were going to retire his jersey on opening night against minnesota and here he is wanting to play for the vikings against the packers that very night

657892 his knees were shot but he just couldnt quite retire
657893 for probably 25 years favres life has been centered around football

657895 in the case of a vacancy for leader each nomination must be supported by 12 5 per cent of the commons members of the plp
657896 where there is no vacancy any nomination must be supported by 20 per cent of the same body
657897 when the plp is in government and the leader is prime minister an election shall proceed only if requested by a majority of party conference on a card vote
657898 it was the failure of the conservative mps to add up properly that was the primary cause of the removal of margaret thatcher in 1990
657899 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
657900 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
657901 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
657902 i really do believe these could be the best years of my playing career and i can go on and score plenty of runs
657903 it is a difficult job but a fantastic job but not many people get to do it which is a real privilege ive loved every minute of it
657904 its a big disappointment not getting through until next year but theres no point carrying on when you know its time to go
657905 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
657906 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
657907 i am very disappointed for michael vaughan and for england because i thought he was an excellent captain and leader
657908 i said on my radio show last week that i thought he should stay on as england captain
657909 he is a terrific player and like collingwood is probably only one innings away from resurrecting his form
657910 the timing is never right when to resign but it tends to be when you have lost a series i think that pressure from outside has built up sufficient for him to say enough is enough
657911 we have made some terrible mistakes in iraq and it is only by talking about them that we will learn from them
657912 last autumn we made a mistake which was understandable but not excusable a shia prisoner ahmed al fartusi said he could put a stop to the killings we released 120 of their prisoners and withdrew out of town but when we moved out lawlessness took over as 90 per cent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army known to british troops as the jam had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
657913 as if the problems were more about a few criminal tribes and families than religious groups baghdad thought basra was easy to solve and didnt fully understand the extent of the problem plus the americans with their obligations in mosul and elsewhere believed basra could look after itself it was compounded by having little guidance from above as to whether we were right to accept the deal
657914 there was a sense that no one was making policy in london

657918 consent post mortem examinations are so infrequent it is almost irrelevant to talk about them
657919 it has huge implications and is a trend we would like to reverse the system is creaking and tension is building we could end up with an insufficient number of pathologists with the necessary skills to undertake post mortems
657920 pathology provides the best way to monitor and audit clinical practice but we no longer have the critical mass of autopsies for quality control and as a result we may not pick up something when it goes wrong autopsies should be seen as part of the whole care package it would keep clinicians on their toes pick up unknown complications and interactions as well as problems that were missed before death so that we can modify clinical practice and do better next time
657921 they play an important role in public health whos to say we didnt miss a trick with the obesity epidemic
657922 the reason to request a post mortem is to essentially find out if you got it right or not so it may be easier for some doctors not to find out

657929 breath of fresh air after the stale self indulgent solipsism from warwick
657930 he probably felt he needed to set himself up as the heir apparent
657931 and whatever has happened this week it has worked now everyone is talking about david miliband as the heir apparent
657932 he would mark a return to the old blair policies that is not going to be helpful in a general election campaign we need to find a unity candidate
657933 hes a brilliant guy but he is not achieving everything he should have done
657934 are they serious about carrying all of this stuff on or is there a bottom line we are in a game of brinkmanship they cannot get rid of him brown so the worst case scenario is they plunge us even deeper into civil war
657935 but if we want fathers to play a full role in their childrens lives then we need to bring men into the play groups and nurseries and the schools and here of course we hit the immediate difficulty of whether we can trust men with children
657936 feminism encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians
657937 it cannot be assumed that men are bound to be an asset to family life or that the presence of fathers in families is necessarily a means to social harmony and cohesion

657942 despite nature having had nearly 100 years to reclaim the site many of the important industrial features such as the old drum house and the foundation tiers of the processing works can still be seen
657943 lots of unexpected garden features remain now overgrown but still visible as you walk around including old pergolas gardeners huts and some unusual tree species
657944 this hidden jewel is a well kept secret presently known only to local dog walkers
657945 this is an enchanting woodland whose crooked oaks adorn part of the estuary of the river fowey it is well worth a visit to see heron little egret shelduck and curlew along with other wading birds on the estuary turn your attention to the wood itself and you may be lucky enough to spot roe deer or badger or birds such as the greater spotted woodpecker bullfinch and goldcrest
657946 lots of subtle woodland archaeology woodbanks sunken lanes iron ore extraction pits and saw pits

657949 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
657950 chinese human rights activists are being detained harassed or forced to leave beijing while their supporters abroad are being prevented from going to china it is against this backdrop that the chinese government and the international olympic committee ioc plan to launch the 2008 summer olympics
657951 must have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games
657952 im not going to make an apology for something the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet

658002 before submitting a video resume job candidates should check with the hiring manager to ensure the company does not have a policy against their use in evaluating candidates

658056 when one is trusting in the innate goodness of the universe its easy to give up our old ways of doing things our reliance upon everything from poor leadership to destructive energy sources melts away in the light of new more pleasing alternatives there are those of course who will cry out that the transition will be too rough that if they were to let go of their present way of life there wouldnt be enough food on the table or there wouldnt be a roof over their heads in short theyre unable to envision a way to step into the new paradigm that doesnt threaten their current security and survival belief systems to these people our response is always the same seek self empowerment you can have complete control over your life others cannot dictate your reality to you unless you let them by your thoughts you create your world and you can choose to change it all

658070 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

658140 with regret and unfortunately i have to say that i am the main book seller in afghanistan there will be a crisis of books if something happens to us or if we collapse so it is very important that we have others involved in this too
658141 that way a student would have saved money and time by not traveling all the way from kunduz or takhar to kabul to buy a book
658142 there was a big rush and enthusiasm but i had to drop the project for i did not receive support from the government and the ngos of course business was and is part of my agenda but people would have benefited more from it

658155 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
658156 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
658157 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
658158 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
658159 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
658160 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
658161 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
658162 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
658163 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
658164 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war

658172 sudah tiba saatnya untuk melakukan kritik terhadap teks seba gai mana telah dilakukan terhadap kitab suci yahudi yang berbahasa ibrani arami dan kitab suci kristen yang berbahasa yunani
658173 untuk menghindarkan perpecahan umat dalam penafsiran al qur an maka dibutuhkan alternatif baru sebenarnya sudah kuno yaitu herme neutika
658174 i wonder if thats what thier sister brother looks like
658175 tinggalkan paling tidak kritisi tafsir lama jangan percaya begitu saja pada penafsirnya bahwa mereka adalah tulus dan tidak punya maksud apa apa mereka juga manusia mereka punya kepentingan punya wawasan yang terpengaruh oleh faktor sosial budaya ketika itu
658176 metode penaf siran al quran selama ini senantiasa hanya memper hatikan hubungan penafsir dan teks al quran tanpa pernah meng eksplisit kan kepenti ngan audiens terhadap teks hal ini mungkin dapat dimaklumi sebab para mufasir klasik lebih menganggap tafsir al quran sebagai hasil kerja kerja kesalehan yang dengan demikian harus bersih dari kepentingan mufasirnya atau barangkali juga karena trauma mereka pada penafsiran penafsiran teologis yang pernah melahirkan pertaru ngan politik yang maha dahsyat pada masa masa awal islam terlepas dari alasan alasan tersebut tafsir tafsir klasik al quran tidak lagi memberi makna dan fungsi yang jelas dalam kehidupan umat islam
658177 apalagi sebagian besar tafsir dan ilmu penafsiran yang diwarisi umat islam selama ini sadar atau tidak telah turut melanggengkan status quo dan kemerosotan umat islam secara moral politik dan budaya
658178 lihat ilham b saenong hermeneutika pembe basan 2002 hal xxv xxvi 10
658179 maka maknanya tentu bisa berubah secara mendasar jika allah meng haramkan babi lalu dianalisis secara sosial budaya ketika itu maka akan bisa disimpul kan secara hermeneutis bahwa babi haram karena dagingnya enak dan tidak ada di arab
658180 sesungguhnya orang orang yang beriman orang yahudi orang nashroni dan orang orang shobiin siapa saja yang beriman kepada allah dan rasulnya dan melakukan kebaikan menurut islam mereka mendapat pahala disisi nya dan tidak takut atas mereka dan tidak merasa sedih
658181 barang siapa yang melakukan suatu amal perbuatan yang tidak ada atasnya perintahku maka amal perbuatan itu ditolak
658182 saya tidak mengatakan bahwa tidak relevan yang saya katakan adalah bahwa pemikiran yang dipakai oleh para teolog dan fuqaha untuk menafsirkan tidak relevan sebab sekarang ilmu baru seperti antropologi tidak mereka kuasai kita juga memiliki linguistik baru metode sejarah biologi semuanya tidak mereka kuasai dengan epistema yang sama yakni berdasarkan karakter teksnya yang berbahasa arab dianggap mempunyai persamaan dengan teks teks sastra atau kitab suci lainnya
658183 kalau tidak dari bantuan asing darimana mereka mencetak buku buku karyanya
658184 politik ekonomi dan lainnya penting tapi ilmu lebih penting sebab ilmu adalah landasan tegaknya iman jika ilmu rusak akan lahir ulama rusak yang lebih bahaya daripada orang kafir yang rusak
658185 para pendukung pemikiran nyeleneh ini bisa saja dari perorangan lembaga bahkan negara
658186 saya menolaknya karena mencium ada kepentingan tidak baik dalam kontrak tersebut
658187 saya harus tegaskan dulu bahwa saya bukan aktivis jil tapi kalau saya diminta mengisi oleh jil sesuai latar belakang saya akan mengisi
658188 ini yang tidak benar tradisi kritik ini sulit berkembang jika budaya ilmu tidak berkembang
658189 jangan menyangka bahwa dengan terbitnya buku ibu ini nanti mereka berhenti nanti mereka terbit dengan versi lain lagi
658190 wahai tuhan berikanlah petunjuk pada kaumku karena mereka belum mengetahui
658191 lipocrisa di chi vive con la ragione e mai con il torto
658192 benar benar tidak identik dengan hermeneutika yunani juga tidak identik dengan hermeneutika kristen dan tidak juga sama dengan ilmu interpretasi kitab suci dari kultur dan agama lain

658195 memperluas menjelaskan atau menginterpretasikan cerita yang ada dalam dan memaklumkan pengertian kata kata atau ekspresi yang janggal serta menjelaskan keadaan ketika ayat ayat itu diwahyukan
658196 dalam tafsir tidak ada ruang bagi terkaan atau dugaan yang gegabah
658197 tafsir dan tawil yang permanen sebagai metode pendekatan yang valid terhadap ilmu pengetahuan dan metodologi ilmiah dalam rangka pengkajian kita tentang alam semesta ini
658198 barangsiapa membunuh seseorang dengan secara tidak sah bi ghayri nafsin atau dengan tanpa suatu kerusakan peperangan di muka bumi maka ia sama dengan membunuh seluruh ummat manusia

658580 there have been rumors that maybe this divorce was a ploy to protect your assets
658581 if this is a ploy her being intimate with a 19 year old kid is pretty good acting

658598 you go in and take a hot shower and retire to bed and you start what i call zoning down coming back to real life
658599 then you start talking to yourself you did it this was your dream when you were at mcclymonds
658600 its the best feeling in the world when youre the fastest man in the world its like walking around on clouds
658601 my ex wife doesnt know this nobody knows it but i stood there for 10 or 15 minutes crying i had to let it out
658602 they told my wife dont sleep in the bed with your husband they gave instructions to a married woman on how not to sleep with her husband
658603 i slept in the bed and we did what husbands and wives do
658604 i felt fine the next morning because i got such a good rest the other guys were tossing and turning i was in a comfortable place that i was accustomed to very relaxed and i just went out there and ran
658605 i dont even think i did the big picture until 10 years later
658606 im ready for bed im laying down but i was back in that first pitch
658607 it was the first time i sort of enjoyed it at all i remember the feeling and everything clicked
658608 everything you worked for the last 20 years sort of came out in that first pitch i dont know if they clocked that but i know it was freaking fast and it was going to go right down the middle
658609 its just weird its a team sport but when youre in that pitchers circle sometimes you feel really alone
658610 cmon you and me now they televise everything its a good thing they didnt do it then because you would have seen me talking the whole time
658611 i understand why he did it she said of u
658612 but even after the game i was still thinking about how that next pitch would have been better than the last one i threw
658613 i suppose that doesnt let you enjoy it as a whole but the older i get i look back on it more fondly than i did right after the game
658614 i was one of the few to make it through the boycott you have to answer so many questions am i going to win my times made me a favorite but until you step on the blocks you just dont know
658615 the 200 butterfly was a tough race to have hanging over my head because it was so much of a chore for me it was back to business
658616 when youre in the middle of it you almost cant know how special it is
658617 twenty four years later i can definitely step back its different now you definitely realize how special it is and how lucky you are
658618 we were in l a and we had a big party at the hotel afterward
658619 you can imagine as a college junior there were not really any boundaries
658620 sean was 2 months old and we put the gold medal around his neck and took pictures of him
658621 but they were both dreams to be able to share with family and friends there was satisfaction and relief too you feel some pressure representing more than yourself youre playing for the united states
658622 i probably could have gotten home from barcelona without the plane
658623 i remember reminiscing on the flight with assistant coach p j carlesimo how we were going to go down in history
658624 one thing that was for sure you can only do something for the first time once
658625 that medal is a symbol of a lot of things
658626 ill always remember 1996 as the olympics that women took over we showed the world that women are strong competitive and beautiful that was the beginning we went down in history that group was amazing
658627 i just remember thinking what this is crazy at one point i looked up and thought i could see stars twinkling in the sky but it was the lights from all of the cameras
658628 there was this sense of freedom release and joy we were so elated
658629 there was a greater purpose to show the world a level of womens basketball theyd never seen the olympics was a launchpad for womens basketball in the united states we showed people what we already knew for years
658630 whenever you can do something that has a lasting impact
658631 to me an athlete who has an individual sport and theyre on the stand by themselves i can see its a lot more emotional than it is for a team
658632 its very exciting but with an individual you see the tears coming down their face i dont remember anything special we did it doesnt stand out like other things like winning the ncaa title at cal
658633 it was kind of a blur at some point all the guys got to me
658634 the focus was really on me because of what had happened to me they obviously wanted it for themselves but they wanted it for me that was a good feeling i wanted them to know in every way that i appreciated that because i really did i was very happy that they felt that way about me
658635 obviously that wasnt my prime objective not having that 100 detracted a bit but only in the sense that i didnt get to run it

658641 t can backfire but i dont think its going to neck her career
658642 shes a great talent and if she wins a gold medal theyll be lining up 10 deep
658643 progress has been made and that they want to continue their efforts to start an intergovernmental dialogue that should lead to a profound state reform
658644 we cant solve a political crisis that has been going on for one year in just ten days were mediators not magicians
658645 why did it take the lab 9 days to examine the mussel sample
658646 taken in high numbers dsp may cause stomach and intestine complaints yet weve sold all our mussels and none of our customers has come been reported ill
658647 as mr versluys sent the samples off to the lab himself which then had to contact the food agency some extra time may have passed
658648 under the given circumstances the belgica mussels shouldnt have been introduced on the market in the first place

658651 hes not ready to step in and immediately make an impact on a team
658652 however in my seven years of pre draft training i havent seen many better projects we had ricky sanchez down here who was drafted directly out of high school as well as weve had numerous kids who weve prepared for the draft including monta ellis louis williams and jackie butler all guys that were drafted and turned into pretty good players and john is a much better prospect than any of those guys were
658653 if he gets in with the proper strength and conditioning program hes going to have a chance to be one of the better shot blockers and really impact the game from a standpoint of maybe getting to the level of a poor mans patrick ewing
658654 he had a knee injury while he was at winchendon and it wasnt rehabbed correctly
658655 he lost about 50 percent of the leg strength in his right leg which caused a very abnormal limp so we spent a lot of time with the physical therapists and the strength coaches trying to regain not only the strength in the leg but properly train the gait patterns
658656 he articulated 75 80 percent of the stuff that he wanted to in english
658657 i think he really came a long way articulating himself in the english language obviously in that short a bit of time its going to be difficult to pass an sat test
658658 i think fatah has contacted several big east programs to see if they would be interested in recruiting john
658659 i dont think uconn would be interested because of thabeet
658660 with his knees his lack of offensive skill there was an understanding that college was the best option for john if he cant pass the sat test
658661 there is nothing to tell about kashima antlers nobody asked me about ronaldo nobody from the board called me or even intermediaries his priority now is to recover from his knee operation undertaken in february
658662 he has been doing three sessions a day for the last three weeks besides in the last couple of days he is playing tennis the other day he played a two and a half hour match and didnt feel anything that proves he is all right
658663 the european championship is the biggest disappointment of my career for the national team we have always experienced success
658664 the world cup and the qualification were positive we were not used to it losing after the elimination we experienced some ugly and difficult days but i am able to turn the page and retrieve the optimism to go forward
658665 during the holidays i found lots of people even in italy that didnt give me all the blame the criticism has been exaggerated in the newspapers and on t v
658666 he lippi has returned because he is convinced of realising another dream and he wants to live through something as historical as the world cup lippi can deal with the pressure that comes with the national team
658667 however donandoni had to suffer a paradoxical situation now it seems the change of coach was a mistake personally i am very sorry i had a good rapport with donadoni it turned bad on penalties and nothing else the federation made their decision based solely on results

658688 newspapers have to make as much profit as possible for their owners as the first consideration
658689 that first book review and others like it stimulated interest in what i had to say

658912 we have not reached that point but clearly irans pursuit of a nuclear weapons program is a destabilizing force in the region
658913 we should begin direct hard nosed diplomatic talks with iran in concert with our european allies
658914 i would never take the military option off the table but we need to move away from the reckless foreign policy that uses the threat of force as the first option instead of the last
658915 if iran attacks the united states that requires a full retaliatory response
658916 a long term commitment of u s troops in an iraqi civil war is not in the interest of the u s iraq or the wider middle east
658917 we are there and we must finish what we started
658918 premature withdrawal would also open the door to mass ethnic cleansing and possible genocide
658919 the military diplomatic and political progress would be squandered if we were to withdraw before iraq was ready to secure its own borders and protect its own cities
658920 needs to listen to our generals they have shown they have the expertise to assess well the military and political situation on the ground in iraq
658921 is only one front of the global war on terrorism
658922 the way we win is by setting the tone globally that terrorism will not be ignored
658923 an iranian attack against israel would be a threat to peace in all regions of the world
658924 before i could support any military action i would need to be convinced not only that such action were in the national interest and in response to a clear threat but that there was a clear and achievable mission i have not yet seen such a mission described in iran
658925 if a diplomatic solution is not soon achieved the next congress and president may very well face a world crisis over an attack by israel to forestall nuclear weapons development in iran
658926 irans missile tests also reinforce the need to expand our missile defense system into europe
658927 the war in iraq was a war of choice not a war of necessity
658928 the rise in violence and casualties in afghanistan have made it very apparent that additional troops are needed in the country
658929 we cannot allow that government to fall to islamic radicals
658930 they have a vested interest in securing peace in the middle east
658931 the united states needs to encourage the nations in the region to have an open dialogue with each other the united states must act proactively by coordinating diplomatic political and economic solutions
658932 it will be up to nato as a whole to police itself and its member countries regarding the commitment being made to the organization as a whole
658933 congress should use its diplomatic leverage to assist american efforts to increase allied assistance in afghanistan but withholding aid to our nato allies would be counterproductive

658966 i have decided to stand down as england captain to be honest it is the hardest decision i have ever had to make but also the easiest
658967 i am giving away the job i have loved for five years put my heart and soul into the job but my mind has told me to pack it in
658968 i feel if i kept going as captain my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this decision will prolong my career i am going to carry on playing i believe there are a lot more runs in me i hope this decision will help that
658969 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok
658970 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
658971 its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
658972 its just as grave and just as brutal like cheating with doping
658973 the international gymnastics federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship world cup and olympics
658974 a passport does nothing passports at this point in china is nothing they can do anything

658983 he was with us last week at our national championships seeing us off and giving us words of wisdom
658984 mark lenzi the 1992 springboard gold medalist and 1996 bronze medalist has also been visiting our training centre and that type of thing
658985 they are really wanting us to win they want us to move forward
658986 they truly want to be involved greg has been a great support hes been to a lot of our training camps over the past three years and mark has most recently got involved because hes back into coaching
658987 both of them have just given us words of wisdom and words of advice and said heres what it is and go do it
658988 i think we have done a better job now of preparing our men than we have in the past years so i think were going to be able to step it up
658989 the chinese certainly are favored they are on their home soil and theyve dominated the sport for the last couple of decades
658990 baseball is cubas national sport and cuba is the reigning olympic champion so we must do it again this time
658991 but these olympic games are going to be the most difficult ones from a historic standpoint with so many strong teams in competition

658998 there is a little haze in the air but that reminds me of los angeles in 1984 but its nothing like ive been reading about
658999 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
659000 a safe olympics is also a key indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
659001 protest by athletes doesnt really mar the games because that is something even the ioc would be opposed to
659002 but i think major protests that the chinese put down in front of television cameras particularly if they are foreign protesters that could look very bad
659003 personally i think we will start formal monitoring of ozone and pm 2 5 from next year
659004 we cannot keep up some of the temporary measures up after the olympic games but they will provide experience for future measures
659005 its completely understandable if youve got a mob surrounding you trying to get to you
659006 the bicyclists were using both sides of the roadway effectively blocking traffic

659010 if mother nature cooperates i expect there would be an impact but it all depends on the wind directions
659011 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
659012 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
659013 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities

659102 this track definitely didnt suit my heavier airplane but watching the other guys fall off worked out well for me i had to run hard against nicolas in the final because the weather was smoothing out and with less wind thats better for him in the final the conditions were a lot better than earlier were just gonna keep trying to go out there and win races paul is gonna be tough to beat but its a definite help where he finished he can do that again as far as im concerned
659103 the conditions were pretty tough and i was just trying to surive i wanted to put down a good run and watch the others fall away and surprisingly enough thats what happened were just a couple of points behind paul now were going to continue doing what weve been doing just gonna go out there and try to win and see what happens
659104 i had a little problem with the neck in rotterdam pulling gs as i hit some turbulence and tore up my neck it hurts now and it hurts more pulling gs but i just cowboyed up and did my job its too bad for the brits because nobody wants to fall out in their home country

659174 es dif cil porque ellos en febrero y marzo est n jugando la champions pero han acogido bien la propuesta
659175 estoy muy contento porque pude volver bien que es lo que m s quer a la verdad es que quiero agradecer a todos por el apoyo que me dieron siempre compa eros cuerpo t cnico y al club principalmente

659188 imagine over 350 000 engineers pass out every year hoping to get jobs and according to industry bodies only over 20 are employable thats a real challenge now imagine this we create a startup that is built on a principle of open innovation every year we throw up a 1000 ideas that we can see are gaps from internet to telecommunications and finance to healthcare for global markets including that in india we then throw open this opportunity on an annual basis to 400 000 students including professionals who work across industries in india to collaborate on these ideas and they can do the opposite or their own we then connect them to mentors and investors of time and capital and they have just 3 months to plan and prototype their ideas or technologies or businesses the ones who make it through are ready and then we have a portfolio of over 200 companies assume 80 die annually to take to the next step so now people dont have to have only one option to just look for jobs they can become wealth creators and this way we can kick start global innovation out of india we can connect these ideas and startups to other clusters of innovation ideas investors and markets and other opportunities to collaborate and we have a pretty powerful opportunity here even if these 400 000 students invest 100 each we then raise over 40m a year vc fund from their own fraternity and those who dont start continue to participate as investors in people whose ideas have survived the darwinism this also means on an average every one of these startups get to over 200 000 seed fund from their fellow alumni and social networks here is an opportunity to create wealth for all if we do this annually we create wealth jobs opportunities and more importantly help make india very competitive as a nation for the next 100 years and in the process leapfrog and leverage all the good work that the services companies inindia have done over the last 20 years this also means that instead of doing engineering or masters projects just for academic sake and a must do now people have the opportunity to go to the next level whats the worst case there isnt one people learn so much they become good enough anyway to get a job and employable from day one whats the best case we create billion dollar global companies year on year and then there is no stopping the great talent that india and the world has the idea democratize innovation and investing bottom up and may a thousand talpiots stanfords and iits bloom

659232 it would be nice to win a wgc it really would
659233 i havent really thought about it too much i think maybe 20 years from now or 30 years from now theyll have prestige much like i think the guys who first won the masters had no idea what this tournament was going to become
659234 i have no idea where the wgcs will be 30 years from now they started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about like a major
659235 but they are always the best fields in the game theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests of golf so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those yeah

659239 id go open masters us open us pga the others have a character that the us pga doesnt have it is just another event in fact id put the players championship ahead of the us pga thats a fantastic tournament with a great field i know the us pga has a great field too but the players should be the major

659252 there are a few grey areas which we need to address we have to ensure that if put in those conditions we can come out on a better note
659253 its still on trial and i think it needs good look in both the captains would sit with the umpires match referee and officials at the end of the tour to discuss those issues
659254 it was a really good comeback by india it was a crucial match for them and they did well

659570 we have consistently reported that our arrears remain very healthy and that we are not seeing any deterioration
659571 i think the current uncertain conditions will last for 18 months to two years as the fall out from the financial trauma takes time to play out
659572 in september we commence the next stage in our darwin asia strategy with the commencement of services to vietnam
659573 we are looking at a range of destinations within a four to five hour flying range of darwin
659574 the cost of operating to darwin is the highest of any airport on the entire tiger airways network
659575 this is an important point to stress combined airport and fuel costs in darwin cost more than any of the 27 airports that the airline serves across australia and asia
659576 anz is considering all options which includes legal recourse against the auditors
659577 the bank is also in discussion with other creditors to determine what legal avenues are available
659578 reviewed the six monthly accounts to 31 december 2007 and concluded they were not aware of any matters that would lead to the accounts not providing a true and fair view of the groups financial position
659579 i want to make it clear that there is still quite a lot of investigating to do before we form a view regarding the previous auditors of the company
659580 that said we are in discussions with creditors on a daily basis and there are a number of actions we are looking at
659581 we have another meeting with ppb on tuesday and we will consider whether to keep funding the administrators after that
659582 as the banker we have a charge so the focus right now for the anz is the potential for recovery of funds any talk of legal action against the previous auditors is at this stage embryonic
659583 journal entries that were processed on the last day of the month and then reversed in the first few days of the subsequent month which have the potential to misstate the reported financial of the group at any given point of time
659584 the thai free trade agreement was an early precedent but these agreements need to be done differently in future
659585 there hasnt been a full level of reciprocity coming out of that agreement
659586 from the industrys standpoint we would not agree to and would not support another fta which came with those features or those arrangements
659587 there needs to be something in it for the local manufacturers
659588 the ftas in place have led to trade distortions and components substitution away from australia thereby discouraging production in australia
659589 for example as there is no duty on imported components from thailand it is cheaper for car makers to import fully built components and modules than it is to import components and assemble modules here
659590 the thai free trade agreement was presented here as a fantastic opportunity for the local industry
659591 the vast majority of people who are file sharing on the internet do not know its illegal or dont know its hurting anyone
659592 if nine of out 10 people who are illegally file sharing now are going to respond to a notice and stop then theres no need for enforcement its educational and its effective
659593 theres no one thing that you can do that is going to fix the problem but when people think about this area they often look to isps to provide the silver bullet
659594 one thing that isps dont want to be is judge jury hangman sheriff posse the whole nine yards we want to play our part but in order to have a democratic society you need laws on one hand and law enforcement on the other hand
659595 if their customer goes on to continue to infringe then there are sanctions available to them and its up to the isp to decide which of those they would use
659596 if the customer continues to flagrantly steal copyright of film and television programs then the ultimate sanction might be disconnection
659597 isps arent the ones who should decide whats legal or illegal and neither should afact
659598 if they think someone is breaking the law then they should do the same as everyone else in this country does and report it to the police
659599 they afact can keep on skirting around this and keep on trying all other things but ultimately if youve got a class of people out there who are consistently breaking the law you dont sit around and bitch and moan about it you go out and charge them
659600 we reported this oversight to the regulators and we have fully co operated with them in all aspects of this investigation

659613 tenders for the 3 1 billion desalination plant closed this week amid unconfirmed reports that the victorian and federal governments have an understanding with french multinational veolia and private equity group babcock amp brown to build it
659614 but the controversy over the desal plant intensified with reports of a tasmanian government proposal for a pipeline under bass strait that would deliver a massive 350 gigalitres of fresh water a year to melbourne or south australia
659615 large scale desalination plants have become necessary essential infrastructure for australian cities as we confront the challenge of climate change

659634 it was natural it just happened ive never felt more connected to someone it wasnt like kissing a 61 year old it was electric there was a spark his age wasnt important i didnt think about his age as we were kissing it didnt occur to me

659675 three south koreans two nepali one dutch one serb one norwegian and one pakistani have been killed
659676 it is the worst tragedy on k2 since 1986 when 12 climbers were killed due to exposure
659677 the time has come for me to open a new chapter in my life
659678 i think i did the best of the worst if you like in the end
659679 i had no idea about the puncture and the team did a great job to help me back into that race and last year i think i lost the championship because of punctures
659680 but congratulations to heikki who drove a great race and he deserves his win we have taken points from our rivals today and made the best of things it could have been a whole lot worse
659681 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
659682 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
659683 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
659684 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
659685 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
659686 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
659687 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
659688 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
659689 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
659690 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go
659691 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
659692 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
659693 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
659694 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
659695 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
659696 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
659697 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow monday
659698 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
659699 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
659700 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
659701 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
659702 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
659703 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success
659704 the goal of olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity
659705 i havent seen the letter i havent got any comment
659706 i am still committed to the raiders however i am appealing the process of these events in the hope that i can be back on the field in the lime green as soon as possible if the club allows it
659707 beating st george isnt necessarily going to assure us of a semi final and losing wont mean we wont but at the end of the day if we lose it just puts us under the pump
659708 porns creepy sensibility has insinuated itself into every aspect of popular culture
659709 simply a trade fair for art rather than a significant or relevant cultural event
659710 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
659711 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later
659712 there are two understandings of this thing we call anglicanism
659713 yesterday evening abu mazen abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
659714 shortly afterwards barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
659715 we need to ensure that we have a competitive professional salary to attract teachers in the numbers required
659716 beyond that we need a framework that would further recognise and reward demonstrated quality teaching skills knowledge and practice
659717 clearly theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
659718 well be looking to have it wrapped up later this month but of course it depends on what we find as to where we go next
659719 we want to double check we want to triple check we want to be able to say to the travelling public everything is ok
659720 the 767 has three hydraulic systems one failed the other two back it up so there was never any safety issue here
659721 we are totally confident these checks will confirm the integrity of our engineering and maintenance operations and our commitment to safety
659722 is likely to be insufficiently connected with the deaths that are the subject of the inquest
659723 they wont move because they think she might still come home looking for them
659724 its worse now as i am getting older and i have got my children i feel more pain for my parents i just want to give them some piece of mind
659725 there has been no trace no sign of anything horrible happening to her
659726 so it just looks like she wanted to go but i cant understand why
659727 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
659728 is defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
659729 ok badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
659730 when communication goes missing so does our youth dont close the door to communication
659731 young people have periods in their life where they may want to rebel against things and make a statement and i think sometimes that does happen
659732 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
659733 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goal posts toward me and its an amazing thing
659734 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
659735 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
659736 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
659737 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
659738 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
659739 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
659740 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient
659741 but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
659742 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
659743 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
659744 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
659745 a combination of these two forces leads to what we observe now and we should not ignore either force
659746 there have been numerous models run that have looked at the two forces and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
659747 later explorers who did successfully navigate the northwest passage actually lived with the inuit and learned from them and copied much of their civilisation and survival techniques
659748 one of my goals when i joined the tour was to win an event and i wasnt sure if it was going to happen since ill be stepping away after this season
659749 this is only the second time ive ever made a final on tour and i wasnt about to let it go
659750 these three men are walking outside when my son is lying dead
659751 these three men didnt get to mykonos to help my son these three men were there to hurt my son
659752 id just like to appeal to all the mothers and fathers all over the world to understand how we feel for the fact that these three men are now walking outside
659753 it is incomprehensible that such things should happen on mykonos the worlds best known tourist destination
659754 the police do their job well but they cant be everywhere in each bar at every moment however the system of bouncers cannot be allowed to govern the islands nightlife we must find a solution
659755 the northwest passage is actually passages theres more than one
659756 for the shipping routes whats at stake is potentially an incredible shortcut between the north atlantic and the north pacific that is many thousands of miles shorter than going through either the suez or panama canals
659757 the extensive arctic continental shelves may constitute geographically the largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum mining remaining on earth
659758 it raised the profile of the program theres no doubt about it
659759 the five nations have now declared that they will follow the rules we have hopefully quelled all myths about a race for the north pole once and for all
659760 i think you could say almost all of this is about the various arctic states trying to carve up the arctic pie to get the largest slice for themselves
659761 i think some of that diplomatic rhetoric is really to try and keep others out to keep nato out to keep the eu out
659762 i want to make clear that this listing will not stop global climate change or prevent any sea ice form melting any real solution requires action form all major economies for it to be effective
659763 theres so many threats which can accumulate in that kind of ocean environment and to add it on top of climate change is just a deeply misguided policy
659764 nothing has actually happened since the inquiry because higher education providers of education and those who provide ongoing professional development of teachers with a few exceptions are still puddling around in postmodernist claptrap about how children learn to read
659765 as part of the national inquiry we surveyed the 34 providers of higher education and held focus groups with them and we myself and members of the board were appalled at the ideological pathology that is endemic in these universities the whole language constructivist inquiry based approach to learning to read
659766 there is not much you could have done against those four guys
659767 who knows where these guys would have stopped at thank you for that man because god knows what would have happened if you hadnt been there
659768 we anticipated about 20 or 30 people to come down here and remember him but we got overwhelmed
659769 how happy we are that doujon was remembered by all of you
659770 im so sorry that im not there to remember him with you all
659771 that if he ever died he just wanted everybody to be happy
659772 i know you are looking down on us and loving the attention
659773 you are always and will be my best friend and i just want you to know that i love you and am proud of what youve achieved in your life
659774 let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings

659777 the second quarter was another strong quarter for our business we are particularly pleased to report record production results this quarter as the second quarter is traditionally one of our slower quarters during the fiscal year we added 27 new wells in the second quarter which brings our total well count to 192 our new wells added during the quarter were supported by the cash flow generated from our existing wells and we utilized very little cash from the 15 million financing we closed in march 2008 we continue to make good progress in our business and look forward to a strong second half of the fiscal year
659778 over 50 of our population is under 18 years of age and every year thousands of young people enter a developing employment market providing limited opportunities
659779 we want to play our part but in order to have a democratic society you need laws on one hand and law enforcement on the other hand
659780 our advice would be to all our authors including peter costello that before publication they minimise media appearances
659781 thats why we need a strong partnership between indigenous leadership our major companies as well as the government itself supporting this plan on the way through
659782 every employer in australia can look at this if you employ one person already please make the second one an aboriginal person
659783 so my direct appeal is for every employer in australia we ask you to step out to your major role your major part in breaking at last the aboriginal social and monetary poverty cycle and employ those aboriginals
659784 what ive found myself pushing against is an open door
659785 trying to do a whole lot of different things i was running just a little bit late to the point that i had to give the speech at this particular conference resort and so i thought being very clever that i would take the short cut and it was pitch black
659786 striding purposefully in the direction of the conference venue mobile phone in one hand and the briefcase in the other carrying speech in suit and then walking at great pace and purpose to the conference venue when i walked directly into the deep end of a swimming pool boof gone
659787 it is very difficult to maintain your dignity and composure when youve just gone underwater in a suit and a briefcase and a mobile phone but you learn from these things im not quite sure what the moral of the story is
659788 underpins the concept of having a key for a new lifestyle
659789 myki makes reference to my key but when read it becomes character like mikey mikey in turn becomes a friend who empowers a new lifestyle with easy access
659790 there are no second chances with such a project of such public interest and political sensitivity
659791 i support same sex marriage i have for many many years i believe that a civilised society is a society that is inclusive and is a society that affords the same human rights the same access to justice the same equality under the law for every single one of its citizens
659792 i have already paid for the flights and accommodation and i have managed to get a few tickets to a few events but obviously the tickets that i bought through this website are gone
659793 i must say up until now i was hoping that the tickets would just turn up but i have been complaining to various authorities about this because i sensed it was a scam a few months ago
659794 ill pursue this when i get back i am going to track these guys
659795 ladies and gentlemen dont try this at home i am after all a professional

659823 there is not anybody in the town who is not outraged at how this came down
659824 i believe there is absolutely no credible reason why notification to my police department should not have been made
659825 they were not notified before then due to the integrity of the ongoing investigation and for officer safety purposes
659826 from my perspective the key part is figuring out where the drugs came from and who should be held accountable for that
659827 no one can make me do anything you cant tell me what to do

659880 i really enjoy medicine i really love the work so i dont really have second thoughts about it in that sense
659881 in medicine we have to pay endless attention to detail
659882 if youre seeing a patient you have to impose this external rigorousness on taking the history and the physical

659906 you may also see an improvement in some types of asthma
659907 another cochrane review summarised the available trials of chiropractic treatment for asthma
659908 all chiropractors must ensure that all the information they provide or authorise others to provide on their behalf is factual and verifiable is not misleading or inaccurate in any way does not abuse the trust of members of the public in any way nor exploit their lack of experience or knowledge about either health or chiropractic matters
659909 does not put pressure on people to use chiropractic for example by arousing ill founded fear for their future health or suggesting that chiropractic can cure serious disease
659910 warning this treatment carries the risk of stroke or death if spinal manipulation is applied to the neck elsewhere on the spine chiropractic therapy is relatively safe it has shown some evidence of benefit in the treatment of back pain but conventional treatments are usually equally effective and much cheaper in the treatment of all other conditions chiropractic therapy is ineffective except that it might act as a placebo
659911 as children grow chiropractic can help not only with the strains caused by the rough and tumble of life but also with some of the problems that children can suffer in their first years colic sleeping and feeding problems frequent ear infections asthma prolonged crying
659912 there is not enough evidence to draw a conclusion about the effects of manual therapy by physiotherapists and chiropractors for adults or children with asthma
659913 the two trial of chiropractic suggest that there is no place for this modality of treatment in the management of asthma

659919 chiropractic is perhaps the most common and egregious example of the bait and switch in medicine someone may go to see a chiropractor and think they will be seeing a medical professional who will treat their musculoskeletal symptoms but in reality they will see the practitioner of a cult philosophy of energy healing the bait claims that chiropractors are medical practitioners with expertise in the musculoskeletal system the switch practitioners of discredited pseudosciences that have nothing to do with the musculoskeletal system a more subtle form of the bait and switch among chiropractors is the treatment of musculoskeletal symptoms with standard physical therapy or sports medicine practices under the name of chiropractic manipulation ironically the more honest and scientific practitioners among chiropractors are most likely to commit this subtle deception the problem comes not from the treatment itself but the claim that such treatments are chiropractic but by doing so and calling it chiropractic it legitimizes the pseudoscientific practices that are very common within the profession like treating non existent subluxations in order to free up the flow of innate intelligence
659920 code of practice chiropractors must meet high standards of conduct and practice the code of practice lays down the standard of personal and professional conduct that is required of all chiropractors it also provides advice in relation to the practice of chiropractic standard of proficiency chiropractic is an independent primary healthcare profession the law does not define the scope of practice for any healthcare profession nor is it the purpose of the standard of proficiency to define the scope of chiropractic the standard of proficiency sets out standards for the competent and safe practice of chiropractic
659921 as i warned in bonesetting chiropractic and cultism if chiropractic fails to specialize in an appropriate manner there may be no justification for the existence of chiropractic when there are an adequate number of physical therapists providing manipulative therapy
659922 physical therapy by 2020 will be provided by physical therapists who are doctors of physical therapy and who may be board certified specialists
659923 there is no compelling credible scientific evidence to suggest that any cam therapy benefits any medical condition or reduces any medical symptom pain or otherwise better than a placebo
