1130217 will not spend money on expansion projects where federal monies are not provided
1130218 the mbta is not financially capable of funding these expansion projects
1130219 i wouldnt say its probable that the federal government will contribute 50 percent of the money but we were looking into that possibility before if 400 million can be obtained from the feds it will help the state tremendously
1130220 it will make the process of getting this project done even longer though asking for federal money triggers federal environmental reviews which are no more stringent than the states but its about a five year process
1130221 the governor doesnt want to push back other projects that are further along to give priority to towns based on their not having a commuter rail
1130222 there are significant issues that need to be addressed with the new bedford fall river project before we can talk in terms of funding you cant build without the groundwork

1130224 but that shouldnt matter we dont need to drill for anymore yucky oil not anywhere we have a greater chance of finding it at home that is when all those wonder fuels
1130225 its this health care thing thats hanging over my head
1130226 i took a look at the same health insurance plan that i priced three years ago and the price has gone up and the benefit has gone down
1130227 now the cheapest plan available to me costs 470 a month thats more than a 10 fold increase in more than 28 years
1130228 if we think of the prices of all goods and services going up three times since 1980 the price of medical care services going up five times and the price of insurance premiums up 10 times i think now we have some really good comparisons
1130229 in the 70s health insurance premiums werent a big factor and now they have added a lot more cost and a lot more economic insecurity
1130230 i think that could help explain why the consumer confidence index and a number of other indexes looking at consumer optimism or pessimism are at historically low levels even though the economy still hasnt officially gone into a recession
1130231 in the late 70s i was 30 years younger and really healthy so the fact that i didnt have health care insurance didnt scare me
1130232 though im still really healthy i know how fragile i am as a human being and i see the potential of my health failing as i get older so health insurance is a much bigger priority for me so i do feel scared about it

1130237 its quadrupled in the last four weeks to two to three a week compared to one big one a month during the summer
1130238 if i had to give you an explanation for the increase in motorcycle accidents id say its primarily due to inexperienced riders not going through the proper training courses that are available

1130274 multi agency communication is essential for mission critical operations apx offers true interoperability and delivers advanced technologies and superior audio quality in one device allowing organizations to streamline the expense of installing maintaining and operating multiple radios

1130278 the absence of common criteria certification is a showstopper for federal customers and other high security vertical markets such as finance
1130279 one of the most significant benefits of common criteria evaluations is that the documentation requirements force vendors to implement strict change management and release controls which can minimize but not eliminate the serious and valid concern of vulnerabilities being introduced post evaluation given this rigor evaluated products should have fewer vulnerabilities over time than their non evaluated peers however do not assume that good cryptography is included in a common criteria evaluation fips 140 2 is a widely accepted and successful standard for evaluating cryptographic modules and ensures the correctness of cryptography
1130280 our indoor and outdoor adaptive wireless lans have drawn considerable interest from prospective domestic and international users with high security requirements for whom fips 140 2 validation by itself is insufficient
1130281 these users require a combination of common criteria certification fips 140 2 validation and directive 8100 2 compliance with these in hand we can bring the same mobility and efficiency benefits to high security users as we do to general enterprise customers it was not a simple task to meet these requirements and we are very pleased to be the first wireless lan vendor to have done so
1130282 the industry leading performance of our 802 11n ip and its full compatibility with the 11n interoperability specification selected by the wi fi alliance is exactly what our customers have asked us to deliver

1130368 my visit to auburn was great i mean i saw a lot of stuff i really loved i think i could be a part of the team
1130369 this year i am going to play tailback just a little bit and i am going to play quarterback like darren mcfadden did
1130370 they liked his coverage skills david could play anywhere from cornerback to safety to outside linebacker he has those kind of skills he will even play some tailback for us this year that should give you some kind of idea on his ability
1130371 i am just trying to get better at being a team leader for south panola and learn to cover the correct way
1130372 we are going to be pretty good again we will have five or six starters back on defense we have a couple of young guys who are pretty good too
1130373 being a team leader i am going to let them know if we make a mistake keep their heads up we are a team and we are going to figure everything out
1130374 i am a team leader i never stop i always keep us going when i am tired i try to make the best out of myself i keep pulling to play hard last year i was one of the leaders as a junior i try to help the guys keep going when they are falling in their reps or stuff like that i am always trying to keep the team going
1130375 the first thing that comes to mind when you think about david is his speed
1130376 the kid can flat out fly he played cornerback for us until last year and then we moved him over to the rover spot where you play olb but you line up at the rush end a lot of times david is a heck of a blitzer he is also a great cover person we put him on their best wr to cover him up he blocked 4 punts for us last year he just has a knack of making plays we are going to use him some at tailback next year for us he brings that tig barksdale explosiveness to that position i found out last year that a player his size like alonzo larwence can go both ways and not wear down at the end of the year i might be biased but i have not see a better football player in the state than david conner
1130377 the town is not that big it is really calm and collected over there i am a small town boy so that is what i am looking for i have always dreamed of being up there i am a tiger here and have always dreamed of being a tiger for life my favorite two players are carnell williams and ronnie brown they were also one of my favorite teams growing up
1130378 when i went over there for jr day they treated my like i was at home it is also close to home and i have some kins who play over there i also love coach nutt i like how he is running things over there their players are listening closely because like i said i have some relatives who play over there right now so they are giving me the low down i actually loved coach nutt when he was at arkansas i would love to be coached by him that is why ole miss is a big factor with me right now it wouldnt hurt my feelings if they would use me in that wild hawg set like they used darren mcfadden too that is how i am going to be used at south panola next year they are going to line me up at qb and rb like arkansas did mcfadden i am having a blast with it i hope i can get that chance at ole miss
1130379 i like how coach croom is running that team he cares more about the team than just being a player he cares about you making your grades getting your degree and staying spiritual with your life he takes the whole team to churches on sundays i just like how he is running things down there
1130380 their colors stand out to me i love their colors i also think their campus is beautiful i want to major in physical therapy my goal is to be a therapist after my football days are over and coach tony hughes has been really staying on me about my grades he really stresses staying on your books he has been an inspiring person for me to look up to
1130381 they started sending me a whole lot of stuff recently and they wanted me to come to their sr camp in july but i have a family reunion on the same day so i can not make it but i really do want to check them out i do not know too much about oklahoma other than they send a lot of players to the league i was taking a virtual tour of their campus on the internet the other day and i like how they have everything set up it is a pretty campus i also love adrien petterson he is my favorite pro player and he came from oklahoma
1130382 like i said earlier i liked what coach nutt did up there i have been watching them for a while my favorite college player was darren mcfadden i loved how they used him at arkansas i am trying to pattern my game after his
1130383 they are just a great team they play their hearts out each and every day they also stress academics over there i have some people who stay over there so i could stay with them if i went to school down there they could show me around and i would not be all by myself if i went to school at lsu
1130384 when i was four i was shot in the eye by a pellet gun i survived that my mom still has the x rays from that i almost lost my eye but god blessed me and i have no lasting effects from it a lot of people do not know that i sing in the choir for our church
1130385 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range

1130387 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1130388 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect

1130485 he stein makes all the usual mistakes nonscientists make whenever they try to take down evolution asking for example how something as complex as a living cell could have possibly arisen whole from the earths primordial soup the answer is it couldnt and it didnt organic chemicals needed eons of stirring and slow cooking before they could produce compounds that could begin to lead to a living thing
1130486 some people may become sensitized to ppd from just one exposure meaning that the immune system becomes prepared to remember the chemical to which it has been exposed or a chemical with a similar structure when this happens a person can develop a lifelong sensitivity to ppd and an allergy can cause a cross reaction to other compounds including certain medications for example use of some heart hypertension and diabetes medications and even some anesthetics used in topical hemorrhoid preparations or oral gels can lead to allergic reactions in people previously sensitized to ppd

1130512 ta tegutses kogu elu oma unistuse t itumise nimel et venemaast saaks taas v rikas riik kuid seda ei ole juhtunud
1130513 teadsin et ta seal viibis kuid temast ei r gitud sain aru et targem on selle episoodiliselt talus viibiva habemiku kohta t psemalt mitte uurida
1130514 sol enits n ei tahtnud maailmast k rvale j da kuid samas soovis olla m rkamatu
1130515 minu jaoks oli see veel uus ja tundmatu nimi kuid neid juba oli kes tema loomingut ja imposantset kuju tundsid
1130516 nii oma suhtumises s jasse kui ka inimsusvastaste kuritegude lahtiseletamisega
1130517 ta p dis omal moel konstruktiivseid ideid juurutada kuid eba nnestus

1130528 it feels good for 5 6 days and its really unavoidable for a briton playing at wimbledon to stay away from it but life hasnt been that different for me since then i still have the same car for starters
1130529 this wimbledon was like nothing i had ever imagined i was happy to be in the main draw but to win a round at my home slam was amazing the atmosphere on court one for my second round match was so unbelievably noisy i had a great time it helped my ranking so i can get entry into better tournaments than i previously used to play also i figure the level of my game goes up if im playing against the top guys i feel more confident now
1130530 i was crazy about cricket the choice was between being a batsman or a tennis player but i figured if i play cricket once i get dismissed ill just have to sit and watch the others bat boring
1130531 it wont affect her olympic campaign as such actually she had gone to reassess the developments on her wrist it will take about six months to be completely normal
1130532 nadal the other day said that for a tennis player a grand slam win is the ultimate i go with him
1130533 it will be a great honour just to be a part of the olympic contingent and since this time it has been included in the wta circuit all the top players are coming
1130534 honestly we are not expecting too much its a very strong field and she has just returned from a four month lay off had there been mixed doubles she probably would have had a chance either with leander or mahesh so ive told her to be honest with herself and give it her best shot
1130535 being the first indian woman to play in olympic singles and having played in all the grand slams she has been representing her country every time she steps on court it will be the same in beijing which being a quadrennial showpiece event one never knows whether you will get a second chance to play in it again
1130536 actually my younger daughter anam is more excited than sania who by nature is very quiet sania who was very studious still rues the fact that she couldnt continue after class xii in fact when she was first selected for an invitational tournament she wasnt very keen to participate in it as it meant skipping an exam but her headmistress at nasr school tiger pataudis sister persuaded her and only then did she oblige

1130581 comparing chris paul two years ago and now is apples and oranges
1130582 hes one of our great penetrators and hes done a great job in these games of getting into the gaps and finding guys
1130583 hes always been talented his game has gotten better but i think the maturity factor has kicked in even more this year
1130584 i dont mind that it gives these guys more time to get international experience and also be in different situations so thats good
1130585 because hes the ultimate player and he shares his knowledge well and i think every guy on the team appreciates it none more than chris and deron
1130586 tarence is a talented young perimeter player that has good length and athleticism
1130587 he has shown an ability to be an effective player on both ends of the court
1130588 be the biggest loss of my career to right now
1130589 it is a different burden for me i can tell you i have two careers most players dont have that experience you play here for the professional league the nba the best league in the world if you win titles in this league that would be wonderful
1130590 being in the olympics is a national honor its a dream i have when i am young it is obligation and an expectation that i have from my homeland the whole country is focused on these games in beijing basketball is a big game in china
1130591 i would say i am about 60 to 70 percent and that is frustrating i am sure now that i will play in the olympics
1130592 but i wont be in my best shape i know that and that is disappointing
1130593 this is about different cultures different backgrounds and bringing all people different ways of thinking about things
1130594 i cant say that any side is wrong americans say the rockets pay my salary no problem i like the rockets whatever uniform i wear i play 100 percent
1130595 for china they have to understand that my loyalty to my country will never change but now i have another group of people in america that i need to take care of these people the chinese fans and american fans are not connected they do not understand how each other think i am the one who is connected i am in the middle that is the important goal of the olympics to bring different people together
1130596 obviously a medal is always a dream when youre playing in the olympics
1130597 youre standing there and you have a medal it doesnt matter what color you have but to be honest we are not at that level yet especially with the injuries to me and to yi jianlian i am not sure of our fitness we can make some history if we get into the 7th or 6th spot but i think 8th is about where we are
1130598 if we win that first game i would quit right away i would say im getting out of here im not playing basketball anymore if we beat usa in game 1 that would be the top i can do no more
1130599 i was a very young player and got my first taste of the olympics in 2000 at sydney i played in athens in 2004 and now this is my home country and the highest special honor in 2008 enough i think why would i need to play in london in 2012
1130600 my parents do not talk about this but it is a story i have heard from people who are friends of my parents
1130601 when my mom lost her chance to play in the olympics instead she had me that year if she had played in the olympics i would probably be two years younger now or maybe not born at all
1130602 the first time i really watched the olympics and understood was 1996 in atlanta at that time i was practicing with the shanghai sharks junior team i remember waking up at 3 a m to watch china play argentina on tv we won that game and my parents told me it was a big big event wang zhi zhi played in that game and played well at that time i thought one day i could play in the olympics
1130603 when you have the flag in your hand you feel like you have a whole country of people in your grasp and of course you feel the expectation it is the pressure that i have continued to feel every day since i came to the nba and now going back home for the olympics it is such extreme focus
1130604 a lot of the people who were living there and all across china were so excited earlier this year about the olympics now 2008 has brought this to us first as the year passes it is difficult to forget we cannot forget we cannot just celebrate games and the olympics when we still have this suffering from the earthquake
1130605 in the last several years ive worked with the china youth development foundation
1130606 they are focused on building schools for kids in poor areas giving out scholarships last summer we had a successful
1130607 at that time besides the money we raised i began thinking that it would be a very good idea to have my own foundation the original plan was to wait until after the olympics to announce it and get it started i would have more time then but the earthquake hit i watched the news i felt so sad i felt helpless in a way and i knew i had to do something right away i can do something to help
1130608 there are a lot of different ways to think about things there are republicans and democrats in america there are different parties everywhere many different ideas
1130609 but if you are not going then you lost a chance to tell people what you think and we have lost a chance to communicate with you
1130610 i think back to when they started the modern olympics in athens in 1896 it was a beautiful idea to put people together again to make friendship and share the honor and share everything
1130611 they stopped wars for the olympics they laid down their arms for the games right now war looks like a part of our life in this world but hopefully no wars no bombs no gunshots in those three weeks of the olympics maybe it is a dream it is my wish

1130659 after i looked again at the programmes of real madrid and oranje i came to the conclusion that i had to make a choice because of the necessary physical effort to achieve the maximum at this level

1130661 i had a very fine tournament with oranje and i look back at that with a good feeling
1130662 i have spoken in length with ruud and i cannot do anything else than respect his decision

1130803 our recommendations recognize the large number of scientific studies that demonstrate greater accuracy in identifying women at risk of having or developing cervical cancer when a pap is combined with the hpv test rather than relying on a pap smear alone
1130804 by using both tests for women 30 and over when cervical cancer is most common we hope to greatly reduce the number of women suffering and dying from this disease
1130805 unlike other cancers cervical cancer is virtually 100 percent preventable if women and their healthcare providers have access to the hpv test and other new advances in preventive care
1130806 the new guidelines from the german association of gynecology and obstetrics will play a valuable role in helping physicians and through them their patients understand the most effective methods for making this disease a tragedy of the past qiagen welcomes the new guidelines published by the dggg in germany a country with a population of more than 80 million and in which the company has a strong presence
1130807 we are pleased at the continued improvements from our base lateral flow business as we approach realizing new revenue streams from our dpp products we expect to continue this momentum despite a difficult economic environment as our products serve a global market on a personal note i am deeply saddened by the passing of alan carus who was an outstanding and valued member of our board of directors and chairman of our audit committee since 2005 al worked tirelessly was a tremendous asset to chembio and he will be sorely missed
1130808 this first producing acquisition is a great step forward for the company we are extremely enthusiastic about kicking off our growth strategy with the eddy county properties located in the prolific permian basin which is a major target for us in seeking future acquisitions
1130809 with financing from a strong partner like macquarie we believe we can make the most of the reserves in our current purchase and also have room to grow through future acquisitions
1130810 we believe the improvement plan could increase production from the existing wells by up to 30 an increase in near term production will strengthen the companys revenue base during the initial stages of implementing our program of new drilling
1130811 one of the most attractive aspects of this acquisition is that the shallow rights provide us the opportunity to drill and complete wells with lower costs and fewer operational risks than deeper wells the result is a risk reward profile that we believe can create great value for our shareholders as we extract the maximum upside from our purchase of the eddy county properties
1130812 we are pleased to report strong operating results for the second quarter 2008 continuing our track record of profitable growth
1130813 in 2008 we have grown significantly and our business profile has diversified
1130814 this underlying growth is also reflected in the broader geographic spread of our trade routes
1130815 our owned fleet has expanded in 2008 to 13 ships in total following the acquisition of 3 vessels since the beginning of the year at the same time our chartered in fleet as of june 30 2008 increased to 53 vessels in the second quarter of 2008 compared to 28 in the same period last year
1130816 this increase in our year over year number of chartered in vessels is a direct result of our commitment to capitalize on the growing demands of our existing and increasing customer base who require additional services during times of strength in the dry bulk market
1130817 the acquisition of the six new build ice class panamax bulk carrier vessels in due course will further enhance our growth strategy
1130818 in closing the listing of our common shares on the prestigious new york stock exchange is a strategic milestone in the long term development of our company we believe it will provide us with a significant platform to pursue our growth strategy while at the same time creating attractive returns for our shareholders moving forward we believe that we are strategically positioned to benefit from the strength of drybulk market and the expanding regional trade flows especially in the baltic region capitalizing on our industry know how our strong customer relationships and our commitment to providing our customers with a comprehensive range of transportation and maritime logistics services

1130893 if you are smart and have a message to get across you have to do it in a way thats agreeable sensitive and welcome
1130894 advertisers are realising that if they create their own content they dont need to pay for ad space they have greater control over how their brand is portrayed and ideally they create a more in depth and involving interaction between consumer and brand
1130895 there are two major problems though preventing advertisers from whole heartedly embracing this approach firstly you cant really measure its impact so these efforts dont tend to get the bulk of the marketing budget but instead are ad ons to more traditional campaigns

1130909 the budget for 2007 was half way exploited because the resources were not much and they did not come in early notwithstanding we used whatever we had to the best of our ability for the last three years we have had resources from the ministry of public works in the form of equipment to be used in rehabilitating some roads and we have done a few of them some of the funds from other sources are still in our keeping because they came early this year and it was too late for us to get into the field because of the rains so we are keeping the funds for the end of the year when the rains must have subsided
1130910 we were anticipating revenue of about fcfa 50 million actually what comes indirectly from the state through the ministry of public works is about fcfa 75 million we will use it to rehabilitate some roads in meme division and more particularly around mbonge
1130911 we shall identify interested groups and draw up a plan of action which we will submit to the ministry of agriculture and rural development for funding we hope that with the present food crisis and governments interest to ensure that the population has enough food in the years ahead we shall have the funding
1130912 we are excited about the acquisition of southern for several reasons

1130917 the first two months of the quarter were generally in line with our expectations but took a noticeable downturn in june reflecting the worsening economy
1130918 our portfolio as a whole held its own with same store revenue per available room revpar down 0 6 percent in the quarter
1130919 we had mixed revpar results in our three segments reflecting economic and weather conditions our 56 same store economy hotels which account for about 60 percent of our same store portfolio performed quite well with revpar up a strong 3 9 percent compared to an industry decline of 2 0 percent for that segment according to smith travel research average daily rate adr improved 1 1 percent and occupancy rose 2 8 percent our leisure travel remained strong throughout the quarter while business and construction related travel softened
1130920 our seven same store extended stay properties were hardest hit revpar was down 6 9 percent with occupancy declining 2 0 percent and adr off 5 0 percent the lower results at our extended stay properties were largely due to the sharp drop off in construction and contract activity which together account for a substantial portion of our guest base for those hotels especially in the southeast we believe that this base of business will return to more normal levels once this economic slowdown works through its cycle
1130921 the performance of these acquisitions in the 2008 second quarter occurred in a slow economic environment with a fairly robust economic environment in effect for the same quarter of 2007 the sluggish economy in 2008 compared to last year impacted operating performance and resulted in the total portfolio revpar being down 5 0 percent driven largely by a 4 2 percent decline in occupancy again we are confident the guest base for our south atlantic properties will revert to more historic norms once the current economic slowdown runs through its cycle
1130922 with a decline in top line revenues it was difficult maintaining our margins but our operators did a good job with same store margins declining slightly from 32 7 percent to 32 3 percent
1130923 we have made improvements in controlling our variable labor costs but fixed labor costs are a factor even in a period of slower revenue growth and we continue to experience rising energy costs our operators worked very hard to control variable costs and overall performed well in difficult economic conditions the recent decline in oil prices has not had a material impact on energy costs but a continuation of falling oil prices would be a positive we continue to evaluate energy saving solutions and are sharing best practices among our hotels
1130924 this transaction locks in attractive rates for the next eight years and adds stability to our balance sheet
1130925 our dividend remains well covered and our board will continue to evaluate our payout policy on a quarterly basis
1130926 we expect the hotel economy to continue to be challenging for at least the next few quarters
1130927 in addition there is new supply coming on line through most of 2009 however these levels are not anywhere near as high as they have been in recent cycles a lot of development projects have been halted or delayed which will have a positive impact on the supply demand ratio by 2010
1130928 our portfolio is in good physical shape and our management companies are doing a much better job of controlling costs while working to increase top line revenues
1130929 we continue to work closely with them as we pursue our common goal of improving the operating performance of our hotels
1130930 pricing is improving and we expect more properties at more favorable pricing to come to market over the next 12 months we feel no pressure to acquire at this time our dividend and balance sheet are in solid shape but we remain flexible to respond to unique opportunities while we have not been a recent seller of properties we continuously review our portfolio to look for opportunities to sell and redeploy those funds in higher return assets
1130931 we wish to express our sincere appreciation to the ors office for selecting and supporting our trailblazer as orss first satellite and to the missile defense agency for its role in the development of the initial prototype program which lead to trailblazer
1130932 with the delivery of the trailblazer spacedev has ushered in a new standard for low cost satellites the space business is one of great challenges which are met by people taking great risks while the falcon 1 flight 3 launch was not a success it does not diminish the hard work and efforts of the dedicated teams that combined with the strong government support provided by the ors office enabled us to accomplish the unprecedented in space history accomplishment of delivering a fully functional satellite within six months from ors authorization to proceed our satellite systems represent an excellent value and balance risk cost schedule and performance so we look forward to a long and successful relationship with the ors office the department of defense and spacex

1130952 this quarter compared to the same quarter last year the number of users and trades from our proprietary tradient trading platforms increased by 168 and 465 respectively and the software services segment reported overall earnings growth of 193 in part due to the lower routing costs of this platform we see this as validation that developing and marketing a broadened range of technology offerings is a strategy with both revenue and bottom line benefits and we are excited about the momentum we are gaining by executing on this strategy after emerging from a period of change and reorganization
1130953 overall market softness in the second quarter had an unavoidable effect on our brokerage revenue
1130954 however adding the compelling new tradient pro release to our proprietary technology trading platform available to clients has played a significant role in expense control impacting margins

1130970 while we already have a bevy of clients whose products are truly green or at a minimum much greener than their competitors weve asked ourselves what we can do as a firm and the total offset of our carbon footprint emerged as part of our go forward strategy with respect to operations and our culture in general
1130971 while some climate change is natural and inevitable the ability to meaningfully engage in reducing and or counteracting climate change driven by industrialization is a key factor in the ongoing success of businesses today as well as the ongoing health and habitability of our planet
1130972 sales of all our directed sound product lines grew in fiscal q3 with the largest growth coming from our new lrad x product series
1130973 since the introduction and initial deliveries of our proprietary lrad x systems in late march we have experienced growing domestic and international acceptance and increasing market demand that is continuing in fiscal q4
1130974 with the fulfillment of a previously announced 1 1 million lrad rx order and the expected deliveries of the recently announced marine expeditionary security force lrad 500x order and other pending orders were forecasting a strong q4
1130975 our significant investment earlier this year enhancing and upgrading our lrad technology and products is quickly being repaid through growing order demand for our proprietary lrad 1000x lrad 500x and lrad rx systems from diverse military and commercial security interests
1130976 we expect further lrad x orders and first shipments of our handheld lrad 100x this quarter will contribute to higher revenues for fiscal year 2008 over 2007
1130977 we will be discussing the fiscal q3 results and other business developments on our august 5th conference call
1130978 if snec or camwater is there only to collect water treat and sell it at a very high rate to the people then we believe that they are not there to help us we should respect state laws and hand this water to nkambe council that will protect the catchments and maintain a steady flow of water year round
1130979 earlier the proposal was for a concession to build and manage the bridge now it is going to be done as a contract
1130980 so thats why they set up the spv which will be like a concession holder and whoever builds the bridge will do it as a contract

1130984 it doesnt surprise me this has just been the typical behavior of democrat governors for 50 years
1130985 theres no question that theres enough good results to say that we need to keep going
1130986 what you can do on laptops isnt measured on current standardized tests
1130987 employers are more supportive in certain industries because they might care less what somebodys test score was than do they have the innovative abilities necessary to succeed
1130988 emusic is redefining digital music retail for the 21st century with new features that make it easier than ever to discover new music
1130989 more and more labels are recognizing that emusic is always working to help them increase sales of their catalogues including songs that dont sell on other services

1130998 in the truest spirit of brokerage that line has been broken and its accepted business practice that a brokerage firm can represent both tenant and landlord
1130999 i dont see where its very much different if youre the landlord or youre representing a landlord in a sense its the same master
1131000 its hard to spend seven years in one city and your kids have their friends and theyre accustomed to their school and their routine and you have to make a change but change isnt always a bad thing its a great opportunity to go play in such an exciting hockey market
1131001 i dont think ill get a true definition of what my role is going to be until we get out there
1131002 i go from being one of the middle of the road younger guys in the locker room in carolina to being one of the older guys its a real young team which is great because they bring a lot of excitement and energy to the rink every day
1131003 it should be a lot of fun im hoping to play a bit more of a leadership role its a different challenge for me and one that im looking forward to
1131004 weve already found a place to stay in an area that we wanted near a lot of the other guys who have kids
1131005 were certainly open to the idea of signing a contract extension i think that they want to get me out there and see how its going see how the chemistry is with the team and see how the fit is before making a big commitment
1131006 im on the same page with that well see what the future holds but its an exciting time
1131007 we had some great backing by our sponsors so it was able to work out nice we had a great turnout of kids
1131008 these kids realize that if they want it bad enough or if they want to dream big enough they can accomplish their dreams
1131009 this is a great hockey town im so proud that im from here weve always had a great minor hockey program when i was growing up every kid who wanted to play hockey had the opportunity if i can use the resources to try and make it easier on the parents and kids to be able to get them on the ice and play its the least i can do hockey is where my heart is were going to focus a lot of our attention on hockey but there are also a lot of other programs we want to support

1131015 three vendors chose to exercise their right of veto because each of their results were ummm
1131016 h e was paid 25 to severe his connection with me
1131017 that feeling of connection we get when we trace our genealogies or visit the ancestral homeland or look at old family pictures and say
1131018 and i dont know why thats so meaningful its not meaningful in a specific practical way that theres no specific harm if thats blocked but its crucial to us to feel that we fit into time and space and history when someone knows that theres part of their history that they dont know those questions prey on their mind a bit
1131019 i find it sad that anyone has to resort to looking through a yearbook for their biological parents
1131020 that real consumer spending is down two tenths in june is not a good thing in and of itself but it also is a bad thing for what it means for third quarter consumption
1131021 to get positive consumption growth in the third quarter is going to be very challenging especially with things like auto sales down as much as they are
1131022 what you had in the way rebates got counted was for most people a reduction in taxes
1131023 that reduction was bigger in may than in june effectively that increased taxes and was a negative on disposable income
1131024 the preparation and operation of the tabulating devices their programming and testing and have the representatives in attendance at any or all phases of the election
1131025 the central counting place or places to check and review the preparation and operation of the tabulating devices their programming and testing and have the representatives in attendance at any or all phases of the election

1131028 marco confortola is being accompanied by four rescuers and most probably hell be brought tonight to the advance base camp abc that is at an altitude of 6 000 meters
1131029 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now
1131030 actually everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
1131031 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1131032 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1131033 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
1131034 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
1131035 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
1131036 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
1131037 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
1131038 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
1131039 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
1131040 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
1131041 this can be real ignore the man behind the curtain
1131042 without giving up hope that theres somewhere better to be that theres someone better to be we will never relax with where we are or who we are
1131043 hope and fear come from a feeling that we lack something they come from a sense of poverty we cant simply relax with ourselves we hold on to hope and hope robs us of the present moment we feel that someone else knows whats going on but that theres something missing in us and therefore something is lacking in our world
1131044 pragmatically we just cant get the system to work in a timely manner for us to implement payment of minimum wage

1131050 straight outta the lone star moonbat asylum of austin comes this erudite conservative group blog think
1131051 an excellent and aptly named austin tx based blog you must check it out
1131052 i was thinking that somebody somewhere had a little doll and was sticking pins in
1131053 but something like that just makes you more determined to fight it off
1131054 the aim has always been to start the race and im planning to but i cant make a definite decision because im running on a leg that could break down every time i go out im planning to start the race and run well
1131055 its not a decision im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run she said
1131056 that has already been decided i wouldnt have got on the plane if i didnt think i could make it but because i havent been running outside for huge amounts on it they dont know whether it will get me there
1131057 i know from what ive done that im good enough to be on the start line i dont know but im guessing that im not in 2hr 12min shape but the conditions and the weather are going to make it open i just think that if you can put yourself on the start line youre in there with a chance
1131058 in any race i go into my aim is to win so thats what im thinking
1131059 next season will be a very special year for our international players competing for places for the lions tour to south africa which is a goal many of them can reach
1131060 my priority will be to make sure everyone delivers for the club first i want us to keep winning
1131061 with the departure of lawrence there are of course some big boots to fill but raf is one of the most highly regarded players in the professional game
1131062 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
1131063 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
1131064 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
1131065 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
1131066 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
1131067 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
1131068 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
1131069 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
1131070 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way
1131071 distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era
1131072 theres just a handful of us left but it has become easier for us domestic folks to compete
1131073 this is not just about steel but also maple syrup and avocados and blueberries at the grocery store
1131074 avocado salad in minneapolis in january is just not going to work in this new world because flying it in is going to make it cost as much as a rib eye
1131075 being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money
1131076 green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down
1131077 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
1131078 they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production
1131079 despite everything the american economy is still the biggest rottweiler on the block
1131080 but if its expensive to get products from there to here its also expensive to get them from here to there
1131081 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur
1131082 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realized when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimeter piece of clay and know that it survived 2 600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
1131083 then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech that was in the court of the prison and they let down jeremiah with cords and in the dungeon there was no water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire

1131085 what does the licence fee payer want there are 12 main sports on the bbc and for cricket not to be one of them shows there is a mismatch of priorities cricket fans are licence fee payers and we believe they deserve better from the government and the bbc
1131086 im repeatedly asked when itll cricket be back on bbc screens to which all we can say is watch this space the rights will be tendered in the next year or so and weve said wed like to bid
1131087 i apologise for having to stop but i was losing 10 seconds every time my stomach cramped up
1131088 a number of potential companies have been unwilling to invest the time and resources necessary to participate due to uncertainties concerning the projects longevity
1131089 this dispute is about the administrations effort to allow long haul mexican trucks into this country in a way that i believe compromises safety on american roads
1131090 to date the project has shown that u s and mexican carriers can engage in cross border trucking operations in compliance with applicable laws and with no compromise to public safety or security
1131091 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1131092 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combinations at almost every lunch and dinner
1131093 people may not get a heart attack until their 50s or 60s but arteries begin to clog in childhood
1131094 most of these kids meals put americas children on the fast track to obesity diabetes heart attacks and premature death

1131109 id like to check out a blog in my name for presentation on this group site thatll be called lions development blog
1131110 we have largely incapacitated the government to make the kinds of decisions that we ought to be able to look to government to make so theres a lot to be said for having big companies slice through the knot and say we have to make decisions for our good for our customers good and for the good of society
1131111 i think its important now for the party to be seen to be unified and the party needs to find the best way forward
1131112 i think there are other people like me that believe that colin barnett is the best person to do that and so im hoping to see him elected unopposed when we meet this week
1131113 the carpenter labor government is certainly on the nose in western australia there are a lot of people disenchanted with the arrogance and the disrespect that they show the community
1131114 i think that colin barnett can lead the liberal party to be the alternative government in western australia and i think that the people will take us seriously
1131115 it will not see the light of day at any future election and therefore it is appropriate that a practical approach to the examination of an appropriate water supply system be considered by mr barnett
1131116 he should quickly commit to the one and only fundamentally sound proposal and that is a pipeline option and completely disregard any further attempts to activate a canal proposal
1131117 we will be feeding into the public sector review and we have to get this right going forward
1131118 what does the licence fee payer want there are 12 main sports on the bbc and for cricket not to be one of them shows there is a mismatch of priorities cricket fans are licence fee payers and we believe they deserve better from the government and the bbc

1131120 but that was good preparation for going to beijing as its going to be like that next week at the olympics
1131121 i feel absolutely fine both physically and mentally im not fatigued at all i have just got to try to store that over the next few days im sure that by the time i get to beijing ill be a little bit tired with all the jet lag but you just get over that and just look forward to playing in such a big competition
1131122 after winning his first masters series title andy is now one of the favourites to win the gold in the singles in beijing
1131123 i think it is going to be great to compete at the olympics with my brother there arent that many who get the chance to compete at the olympics but it is going to be even more special to be a part of it with my brother
1131124 i see it as a real opportunity it would be amazing to win an olympic medal with my brother really incredible there are going to be some tough doubles teams out there but andy has been playing some great tennis
1131125 i think anybody who does well at the olympics is unlikely to do well at the us open

1131133 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama

1131136 concerns about the financial health of the biggest u s mortgage finance company had driven fannie maes borrowing costs to the highest since march the previous week and its shares had tumbled 45 percent on the new york stock exchange investors in asia the biggest foreign owners of fannie maes 3 trillion of bonds were asking the treasury to bolster the government sponsored company and its smaller competitor freddie mac said three people with knowledge of the talks
1131137 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago seemed lost
1131138 america and its political leaders after two decades of failing to come together to solve big problems seem to have lost faith in their ability to do so
1131139 a political system that expects failure doesnt try very hard to produce anything else
1131140 the political system seems incapable of producing a critical mass to support any kind of serious long term reform
1131141 my biggest concern is that the promised bush tax cuts will be in extremely expensive that would create huge deficits and be extremely inflationary
1131142 i have followed governor bush in texas and fiscal discipline is not his strong suit
1131143 a return to the sort of crony capitalism that weve seen in the past would wreak havoc with investor confidence we need a strong sec to make sure companies are transparent and report their accounting fully and fairly we should not throw the individual investor to a wild and woolly free market that is totally lacking in supervision
1131144 i do not see that sort of regime under a president bush
1131145 the next president needs to make sure that the federal reserve fulfills its obligations as bank supervisor i am concerned that governor bush as president would move away from strict regulation of markets for ideological reasons
1131146 since joining citigroup i have been looking into the issue of derivatives this is another area that requires close scrutiny from both the treasury department and the federal reserve i see bush lacking expertise in this crucial area
1131147 i am looking for a market crash as a reaction to the election of george w bush investors should brace themselves for losses of 50 or more and even worse in the tech sector should he be elected
1131148 i was glad it stopped raining but the wind was really bad on the bike
1131149 i knew some of the girls i was competing against so i kind of knew what to expect but you never know until youre racing
1131150 i figured when the first swimmers had about 30 seconds on us i thought itd be over i knew i had to run fast
1131151 the swim was kind of rough but i loved the start on the pontoon
1131152 we ended up getting a lot of open water right at the beginning of the swim and by the time we got to the first buoy we were together right behind the first pack
1131153 once we came out of the water we had to sprint to get into the first pack from then on my coaches were telling me to keep the gas on and dont let up

1131158 not one thing about obamas energy plan will reduce fuel prices nor will it expand supplies theres nothing about his plan that will grow the economy there is nothing in his plan that provides the energy for growth which the american people all desirous of the american dream not only demand they expect
1131159 it remains puzzling that a party can be this open about its desire to inflict real damage on individual citizens via damage on the economy and get away with it maybe they wont time will tell

1131215 his condition is not good he has some bruises and frostbite and exhaustion
1131216 if he is unable to get to advanced base camp tomorrow from where a helicopter can evacuate him then he might be sling lifted but this is a very technical operation and needs a lot of preparation

1131240 despite a lengthy and thorough investigation we have been unable to discover exactly what happened to david garden
1131241 in order to bring closure to mr gardens family i would say to anyone with information about the incident who has not already spoken to police that its not too late to come forward
1131242 we provide a lot of transparency to allow advertisers to see exactly where their ads are being placed they can load and launch campaigns within minutes as opposed to 30 days
1131243 the biggest thing our advertisers appreciate is the ability to optimize campaigns based on performance just like you would with search

1131249 there was some disruption and the street was blocked for some time
1131250 police officers didnt clash or scuffle with the protesters nor did they interfere with journalists news gathering activities or detain any protesters today
1131251 we are investigating possible murder as part of a missing person investigation
1131252 islam is importing creationism into this country most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
1131253 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
1131254 prof dawkins said the failure in classrooms meant religious fanatics had a chance to get hold because we are all brought up to respect faith it leaves open a gap through which fanatics can charge he said
1131255 these young ladies have not expressed any desire to be with their mother or her family
1131256 the first day of practice ive got to tell mouse davis please dont evaluate for five days today mouse and i probably would have cut 55 kids i saw one of our fastest outside linebackers running slower than me because it was all rolling around in his head and hes trying to learn it
1131257 when you get a lot of new people in who dont know what you are doing all of a sudden they dont look like they have the athletic ability that you know they have
1131258 we will get better we will get faster these practices are more important probably than they will ever be as long as we are here
1131259 practice will really change for the first time for me in about 30 years
1131260 when we go to double days next week in the morning the first 70 percent of practice will be kicking and then the last 30 percent of morning practice will be young new people going live against each other
1131261 i dont like going live but thats what we are going to do with the young guys to see who can get up and play at the full speed contact we are looking for
1131262 a very unusual summer camp its kind of exciting if you ask me who is starting one day to the next day it could change the whole camp is going to be fun
1131263 we have a great number of new players both on the o line and the receivers
1131264 we think that our quarterbacks certainly are farther along than they have been we have one returning back that has been ticketed to be the guy and i am sure he will do a great job for us
1131265 i think our quarterbacks are doing an excellent job and that really puts us in pretty good stead
1131266 i think bobby is a big strong kid and what you are looking for in a single back
1131267 with what we do youve got to be a blocker first youve got to be one of the six protectors and certainly bobby is a big strong kid he benches close to 500 not that benching always does it but knocking guys down is what you need he will come right at you and he has got good speed
1131268 the single back is our running game and mcclintock is one of our six blockers so its pretty important to what we do well feature him like well feature our quarterback so theyve got to be a good players no question about it
1131269 the depth chart right now is semi non existent the quarterbacks are fighting for it the single backs we have one the rest are fighting for it we are looking for the most talented group we can get on the field
1131270 overall i think we are more talented than we were last year we are also younger but i think we will be an excellent football team i dont know if that will be right now next year or the middle of the season it depends a lot on how rapidly our young ones pick it up
1131271 from now on when spring practice is over we would like to set the roster we could not do that this year so our roster will be set in the next two weeks who plays where why how and how much we will learn in the next two weeks

1131291 it is imperative that texas officials stay the execution of jos medellin not only because of the pending world court decision but also to take into account recent congressional action on this issue
1131292 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jos medellins execution goes forward

1131298 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1131299 initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1131300 when surprising results are found we want to review and assure our extensive pre launch contamination control processes covered this potential
1131301 obama then was not only wrong about the surge he was spectacularly wrong
1131302 democrats then have compounded their initial bad judgment about the surge with reckless obstinacy

1131304 he was vague on crucial issues of trade defense and foreign policy that currently divide washington from europe

1131314 a simple comparison of the cost of the flywheel with a traditional battery clearly indicates that returns on investment can be obtained within the first two and a half to three years of its 20 year lifetime
1131315 market participants can increase the year on year volume of sales to encourage end users to deploy flywheels instead of replacing their batteries
1131316 the worst case scenario for the flywheel is the reduction in the vacuum
1131317 manufacturers take this issue into account and design the required monitoring electronics to keep constant tab on the pressure inside the containerized wheel

1131319 hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money
1131320 it is a terribly sad situation and i really feel bad for all the couples who have had the disruption and embarrassment at this time
1131321 if hsbc were able to take a more pragmatic view and use this money to fulfill these deliveries then all the couples and their guests would be happy but sadly we are not a big enough company to make them inclined to change the rules its a ridiculous situation
1131322 we did what we could to help wrapit and it certainly and quite obviously isnt in our interests for it to go into administration faced with its worsening financial situation we had no other choice

1131347 when this class of fatal windows errors occur often the available information is misleading or flat out wrong
1131348 while there have been several unsuccessful attempts in the past to document these problems faqware has complied a far more extensive list and gone the extra mile to explain in easy to follow steps the best way to approach each issue
1131349 in the past these types of errors have been painful to solve even for experienced it personnel i know many users simply give up because they dont even know where to start

1131377 it is likely that existing regulatory arrangements to deliver local drama documentaries comedy childrens news current affairs and other programming may have diminishing effects on the market as the existing business models of broadcasters are challenged and the content offered becomes increasingly foreign
1131378 it is time to reassess and reshape the australian content policy framework
1131379 by making new connections between the previously distinct fields of communications media and cultural policy the government can address the issue ofensuring australian content ismade available in the digital environment

1131458 we just wanted to see the story come to life
1131459 loverds script was actually a television pilot and our first comment was wow
1131460 i think the best thing a young writer could possibly do is work with a company like divide
1131461 theyre all about helping you realize your creative vision theyre young theyre smart and theyre hungry they know what it means to put out a great book and they wont be satisfied with anything less
1131462 top cow is a company that is known for good art and great stories and to be partnered with them on berserker seemed like the right fit
1131463 we want to see people wearing berserker t shirts maybe carrying lunchboxes
1131464 until then we are looking to make a kick ass book
1131465 berserker is one of those unique properties which on the surface may seem familiar but quickly takes you on a series of unexpected twists and turns and grabbed our attention right away
1131466 rick loverds world of dark intense violence paired with rich characters grounded in the real world fits perfectly with top cow and of course were thrilled to have milo and russ at divide pictures as partners on this property as they bring an endless amount of enthusiasm and ideas to the table

1131472 there is no better evidence that individual privacy simply does not exist in googles world than by the chilling amount of detailed visual information google now collects on all of us information that any internet user can now compile in a dossier in less than 30 minutes
1131473 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice there isnt any privacy get over it
1131474 perhaps in googles world privacy does not exist but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google

1131488 as a gesture of our apology and deep respect for the folks at mad magazine we are creating a cross departmental task force to study the importance of humor in the corporate workplace and expect the resulting powerpoint presentation to top out at least 300 pages chock full of charts graphs and company action plans
1131489 we at mad were shocked and confused by this entire incident mainly because we had no idea that circuit city even sells magazines nonetheless we accept their apology but hold out hope that their gesture of a 20 gift card is only an opening offer
1131490 ensuring the welfare and safety of those in our custody is one of our top priorities
1131491 they never gave her any of the proper medications for her aids diagnosis they did give her a prescription for a urinary tract infection but even then they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end

1131509 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
1131510 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
1131511 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
1131512 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
1131513 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
1131514 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
1131515 we wouldnt have wanted to do something that didnt reflect the show and didnt respect the audiences investment in the show and what made it different and unique
1131516 anythings possible and so more than wanting to make it an r rated movie we just wanted the freedom to make it whatever its going to be
1131517 also comedys job is to push boundaries we didnt make the boundaries we didnt move the last boundary but here we are people are expecting something a little crazier than the last thing they saw

1131541 i call on senator obama to call on congress to come back into town and come back to work come off their recess come off their vacation and address this energy challenge to america and do not leave until we do
1131542 what we are finding is that although voters still would prefer that the nations energy problems be solved by new renewable kinds of energy sources wind solar biomass they have now come to the conclusion that maybe oil and natural gas will be part of the solution for quite a while and therefore many of them now favor drilling that they did not favor before they were paying 4 gasoline

1131602 it was an area of society that i had no awareness of
1131603 being in this flat after being in a corporate parenting environment where everything is more or less done for you it was an image of the solitude
1131604 theres a high incidence of some of these people going off the rails sometimes in terms of alcohol or drugs or crime or something like that it gave me something pungent to write about
1131605 i think the world sees these people as thugs when a lot of the time it isnt their fault the way that theyve turned out
1131606 people have to sympathise with these people that theyre in situations that they cant get out of
1131607 i talked to several care leaders several kids in care psychotherapists the whole gamut of the system
1131608 for a lot of these young people the reasons why theyre in care their biography is obscure to them
1131609 a lot of the people that are on stage a lot of the people were representing theyre not always the most communicative
1131610 in fact most of them are not at all im always fascinated about what people give away it might not be a wilful physical expression its moments when they give themselves away
1131611 that you come into a world for an hour and a half or whatever and your perceptions are changed slightly
1131612 everything i set out to write i want to take people in from a different entry point to see that subject matter from a different angle
1131613 i would hope people would come in and be slightly skewed by what they see

1131619 gosh he never said stuff like that when i was in the pews the few times i attended it was all about jesus and love and faith and family
1131620 its a great way to spend money but not necessarily a great way to make money
1131621 i rank well for all of my keywords but only get 50 hits per day

1131623 when asked about how to get ones blog into google news matt shared one of googles requirements for inclusion the blog must have multiple authors so those of you wanting your blog showing up in google news results i hope its a group blog
1131624 people are bus drivers nurses doctors lawyers landlords handymen and all their friends realitives and neighbours gossiping non stop
1131625 god only knows what they are hearing when we are try to talk to them
1131626 of the attempt so you were getting what you deserve would you stop trying then
1131627 i like this set out of here ya know because were ottoman people we really like ottomans
1131628 dude i can drink with you today and ill get wasted with you on sunday but i am not drinking tomorrow thats how serious i am about rage
1131629 we dont know if it was committed by a group
1131630 were not going to stop until we find those responsible
1131631 under penalty of perjury that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed
1131632 our position was that the use in question was fair use
1131633 the phone did it honest i was trying to call josh but while your on the phone i miss you do you miss me too
1131634 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously it would have put apple in a positive light
1131635 when they bought the system of course it wasnt defined for a setup like a community clinic
1131636 so there was a lot of additional costs like programming
1131637 we deal with a lot of changes here with state federal and even county regulations so in order to keep up we needed something that could provide a faster turnaround to meet those changes
1131638 i explained to him what open source software was that the codes are free theyre easy to modify and things like that and he actually bought into it he was really surprised to hear about it and so he asked me is there an open source solution for healthcare administration so around 2003 i researched the idea
1131639 but we got grants for different projects like chronic disease management and we were often allowed to incorporate overhead costs into those budgets so we would use those extra monies to develop the clearhealth system
1131640 operation samahan is particularly important to clearhealth because its an fqhc
1131641 they are representative of organizations with fewer resources that are generally on the front lines of the chronic disease crisis in this country their frugality is a good driver of efficiencies and innovations that have impacted the clearhealth system the proprietary systems out there typically focus on features to sell the software and keep organizations from being able to move or interoperate to support their lock in models working with samahan naturally led us to a model that builds features based on tangible benefits in real settings rather than just eye candy in a sales brochure
1131642 as the beta testers whatever clearhealth developed with other clinics was incorporated into our system as well the whole development project cost about 200 000 in total and we didnt have to contribute a penny were getting all these enhancements for free and as part of the deal i helped them start up certain features
1131643 we were able to cope with all the standard changes in billing really easily
1131644 in the meantime we had all these complaints from other clinics who were saying oh my gosh we havent gotten paid in six months because our software vendors are very slow in keeping up with these changes we were so glad that we got out of that system
1131645 were already in the thick of developing the emr side into our system you cant find any system right now at this cost that can give you full emr capability as well as pms so what will happen with these clinics that have only pms on proprietary software is that theyll have to ditch whatever they have now and move to a new system so its more expensive
1131646 were actually in the process of establishing a separate entity of operation samahan that will offer technical services to other clinics
1131647 in fact were already supporting another clinic thats twice our size for their technical needs with my knowledge of megawest i can help them but theyre on the verge of changing their system and theyre looking very hard at their options are they going to a proprietary system that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars we can help them compare the system we have and with all these features to a proprietary system thats five times the cost just to acquire it
1131648 were getting a one week turnaround with our claims now with megawest we would see a two to three week turnaround community clinics dont have that big reserve and one week of delayed payments can cripple your company because thats your bottom line
1131649 at some point the staff were reluctant but then they saw the system
1131650 megawest is actually text based so its all command line driven so i had older staff members who werent very familiar with the mouse and they were saying well i dont know how to use this because its all a graphical interface its not so much open source or proprietary because they dont really know the difference they just see whats on the screen when i showed them clearhealth which is web based the younger staff got it it was zero training for them because theyre very familiar with the internet with the older staff it was just a matter of getting used to the mouse
1131651 certainly i have sent a signal to both sides of where im headed
1131652 to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
1131653 there is nothing in that language that the plaintiff must demonstrate a transfer
1131654 theres no doubt its being done millions and millions of times
1131655 would congress really fashion a statute where a plaintiff doesnt have to prove liability
1131656 they have to prove every element that a statute requires
1131657 to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
1131658 is using our industry leading videoid technology to manage and protect its content on the site
1131659 given that davenport used his position as part of the relevant air force office to get his peers to use his software the case fails this test but the court also addressed the dmca claims made by blueport and its decision here is quite striking
1131660 the main problem is davenport tested the code at his work place
1131661 the united states as a sovereign is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued
1131662 okay now even though i cant see it theres a hunter in a nook halfway up that wall who is going to destroy me unless i launch rockets in that general direction
1131663 its no accident that whatcouldpossiblygowrong is one of the most common tags applied by this community to stories about proposed ideas or laws the ability to spot and predict faults is a big part of what makes a great engineer it starts with having a healthy skepticism about the world which leads to actual critical thinking many books and courses teach critical thinking skills but what is the best way to encourage and teach someone to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism is it even a teachable skill or is it just an innate part of the geek personality

1131667 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
1131668 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
1131669 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth

1131675 what we are doing is going beyond what the legislation outlines during a disease outbreak but this is an extraordinary case
1131676 it gives us enough to be able to start to move forward
1131677 its certainly not enough to necessarily get us out of trouble but we dont expect that
1131678 so it gives us now an opportunity to work through this and hopefully keep our enterprise going

1131692 the dark side of new eden is what always drew me to the game
1131693 right from the outset youre thrown into a very dark almost sadomasochistic world with cut throat politics and no real sense of self importance
1131694 it pays in our line of work to have no conscience no regret and give no quarter
1131695 veto concentrates solely on pain violence piracy and generally trying to kill or ransom anything that appears on our overview or die horribly trying
1131696 the political and physical map of new eden is already starting to shift and its going to be a hell of a ride to see where it takes us
1131697 trying to fight us will be like trying to drown a cat victory against us will be laced in their own blood because well sure as hell leave our mark either way
1131698 why because being the best is situational and with every engagement theres a new challenge or something new in terms of tactics to be learned

1131704 this field seems to be growing but its all about the presentation
1131705 playing on guilt is no longer effective we need to make the presentation engaging and make people concerned without feeling guilty
1131706 during the academic year i hope that it will become a combination of coursework similar to a new course we offered last spring and internships in the office of sustainability
1131707 we especially want to build on the momentum of this summers program we might have an intern this coming school year producing podcasts for the office of sustainability website so that we have a new podcast every week or two on some topic about sustainability
1131708 we want to build a strong program here at princeton so that we can encourage other institutions to participate in the network
1131709 one of the interesting aspects of this program is merging knowledge about sustainability topics with specific media
1131710 the students need to learn how to express really complicated issues in compelling ways for general audiences certainly these are very scientific issues and we want them to have the rigor of science but a film a documentary or a podcast is a very different medium than an academic paper
1131711 we want to try not to lose the complexity and some of the specificity of the issues
1131712 but we also want to make it available to larger audiences we want the students to understand the possibilities but also the limitations and how these messages will translate
1131713 i was really into video production and journalism in high school and hadnt had a chance to pursue them at princeton
1131714 i had heard this concept of sustainability as a buzzword but never thought of it as the modern evolution of environmentalism as we know it its much more all encompassing that i could have imagined
1131715 i was surprised the filming aspect takes so much time
1131716 as a science major i was interested to hear we need to better communicate the complexity of what goes into every shot creates an image of someone in a certain light for better or worse depending on how you present things
1131717 the program has really exceeded our expectations especially with the lectures and the field trips
1131718 express really complicated issues in compelling ways for general audiences
1131719 one of the goals is for them to use their own voice to speak from a college students perspective
1131720 that point may be important in the larger scheme of things but not for this story

1131732 mit den aktualisierten leitlinien tragen wir den wissenschaftlichen erkenntnissen der letzten jahre rechnung zahlreiche studien zeigen dass die kombination eines pap tests mit dem hpv test deutlich mehr sicherheit bietet frauen mit einem erh hten risiko f r geb rmutterhalskrebs zu identifizieren als der pap test allein
1131733 geb rmutterhalskrebs tritt bei frauen ab 30 jahren am h ufigsten auf durch den einsatz beider tests in dieser altersgruppe hoffen wir die anzahl der frauen die an geb rmutterhalskrebs erkranken oder sogar sterben deutlich reduzieren zu k nnen

1131757 das zweite quartal zeigte ein starkes umsatz und gewinnwachstum und wir konnten unsere strategische positionierung und unsere marktf hrerschaft weiter ausbauen wir haben 19 neue produkte im bereich probenvorbereitungs und testtechnologien sample amp assay technologies mit schwerpunkten in gen und proteinfunktionsanalyse in den markt eingef hrt im juni haben wir die ersten modelle unseres neuen flagschiffes die qiasymphony plattform ausgeliefert die im januar in den markt eingef hrt wurde und bereits enormes interesse bei unseren kunden aus allen bereichen hervorgerufen hat im juli konnten die noch wenigen verbliebenen projekte in zusammenhang mit der integration der digene dem management der entsprechenden abteilungen innerhalb der organisation bergeben werden damit ist die projektorganisation der digene integration entsprechend unseren zeitvorgaben und besser als erwartet hinsichtlich der realisierung von kostensynergien abgeschlossen
1131758 mit der akquisition der corbett life science im juli dieses jahres konnten wir unserer qiagen instrumentenplattform zwei weitere wichtige produkte hinzuf gen und unsere technologief hrerschaft im bereich der molekularen diagnostik weiter ausbauen beide produkte der rotor gene real time pcr cycler und das cas instrument f r die vorbereitung und das ansetzen molekularbiologischer tests k nnen mit qiagens probenvorbereitungs und testtechnologien sample amp assay technologies perfekt kombiniert werden zus tzlich l sst sich der rotor gene real time pcr cycler leicht in die qiasymphony plattform integrieren und vervollst ndigt so ein automationssystem das den gesamten arbeitsprozess von der probenvorbereitung bis zum ergebnis in allen bereichen von pcr basierenden analytischen tests abdeckt
1131759 wir sind sehr zufrieden mit dem finanzergebnis im zweiten quartal 2008 der umsatz lag innerhalb und der gewinn pro aktie lag ber unseren erwartungen f r dieses quartal das zweite quartal verzeichnete ebenfalls ein starkes wachstum in der bereinigten operativen marge auf 28 was einem operativen gewinnwachstum von 68 gegen ber dem vorjahresergebnis entspricht und die erzielten kostensynergien in zusammenhang mit der digene akquisition reflektiert

1131764 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner

1131768 the notion that these two issues can be addressed simultaneously is nonsense
1131769 no policy aimed at fighting global warming can help solve the energy crisis an energy crisis is the proposed solution to global warming
1131770 more than 85 percent of the worlds energy comes from carbon producing fossil fuels
1131771 and it is not at all clear that climate change is something that needs to be fought
1131772 there is no evidence that cutting off our carbon emissions would have any noticeable impact on the worlds climate
1131773 yet it would cause a catastrophic blow to the worlds economy and therefore to peoples lives energy use is an indispensable component of almost everything we do every day and billions of people around the world are suffering right now for lack of abundant energy
1131774 the only crisis we need to worry about is the unnecessarily high cost of energy and the solution to that is to remove coercive green restrictions on oil production and to start drilling and burning

1131810 given the deep roots of the conflict over kashmir it is surprising that the conflict does not muster clearly polarized majorities in pakistan and india falling in line behind their governments positions

1131819 the best chance weve learned is with a different city and given that were talking 20 to 30 years before we could do it again i think a lot will come down to how brisbane develops in terms of further infrastructure hotels and whatever by then
1131820 i couldnt and wouldnt say to the queensland government or the brisbane city council to go out and build a new swimming pool but infrastructure is important villages in the past have been around university sites for instance
1131821 it would be smart to at least have somewhere in mind but certainly i wouldnt be counselling them to go building anything because what you build now would be outdated by then

1131823 it is a 10 15 years thing and something we would have to work through

1131970 our culture is that we want to be very careful about those pieces that we put on stage and we dont want to take that feel of the show away from the guests
1131971 our performance reflects the growing momentum behind this company after two years of repositioning our brand and reinventing the guest experience
1131972 while we still have a considerable portion of our season in front of us im encouraged by the results especially in the current economic climate
1131973 when you have divided party government you have more vigorous oversight
1131974 to assess the oversight of one year can take several years
1131975 it would be wrong to ascribe these accomplishments to the congressional hearings but without question those hearings in 1994 had a galvanizing effect
1131976 one thing that is clear is that there is a heckuva lot more oversight than there was before 2006
1131977 its mainly for men who are exhausted by the summers heat
1131978 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve

1131980 i think a lot of us feel that the american people are entitled to the whole truth
1131981 the american people are entitled to an investigation from an official body that has access to the classified documents that makes as much public as it can
1131982 pardon any official from cabinet secretary on down who might plausibly face prosecution
1131983 a lot of people think that that is not something that goes over well with the american people
1131984 what we have much more of a tradition of is presidential fact finding commissions
1131985 something like this would be unprecedented in the american experience and i think it would be absolutely necessary
1131986 presidential commissions and national security the politics of damage control
1131987 weve had panels that have looked at scandals weve had panels that have looked at intractable political problems
1131988 but nothing in terms of looking at an issue that has this array of legal moral and even spiritual questions attached to it
1131989 while we still have a considerable portion of our season in front of us i am encouraged by the results especially in the current economic climate

1132006 this trial has been an embarrassment its embarrassing that the united states would convene the first tribunal since world war ii to prosecute such a lowly and marginal figure and its embarrassing that this system has been devised to allow prosecution of the alleged crimes of the detainees while covering up the crimes committed against them
1132007 its a pretty offensive ad not only because of the thick accent but also because someone is screaming at you

1132009 there are groups in the past who have joined together in coalitions
1132010 we need to speak to our other groups in the asian american communities to see if theres an interest in starting a campaign against it
1132011 how often have we seen this type of satire lots now six flags is taking this ignorance nationwide
1132012 its more than a bit annoying but im not sure if i see a racist component in it i havent received any complaints about it
1132013 its always that fallback of the stereotype of the perpetual foreigner
1132014 theres still very much that image of them asian americans as foreign and still not belonging to this country
1132015 this is a highlight of why its important to have diverse people in decision making in companies and advertising
1132016 i think it speaks to the need for diversity in advertising and for some sort of interest in cultural sensitivity
1132017 unfortunately there are very many examples of these kinds of racist portrayals
1132018 i dont see this as stereotyping because it really doesnt conform to common stereotypes of asians
1132019 looking forward to seeing this baby i think her drug addict country singing husband is adorable

1132029 all of us must die eventually our lives are like water spilled out on the ground which cannot be gathered up again that is why god tries to bring us back when we have been separated from him he does not sweep away the lives of those he cares about and neither should you
1132030 that is why he tries to bring us back when we have been separated from him

1132041 during the 2007 08 academic year as interim dean of the college of mass communication and media arts gary kolb demonstrated the expertise and experience to be a successful leader
1132042 he also has the support of his colleagues and their trust in his decisions gary brings a strong commitment to the coherence and success of the college and i look forward to our positive administrative relationship
1132043 im honored i was chosen and im grateful for the strong support of faculty and staff in the college who have given me a lot of encouragement
1132044 i feel we can work together to build a stronger college
1132045 being in on the birth of the college and seeing it grow and mature has really been exciting
1132046 im honored to be in a position now to help that process along and move it forward
1132047 a huge priority for me while we look toward the future is that we also pay attention to our past and what has traditionally made this college strong
1132048 evolving the college rather than starting from scratch to rebuild it
1132049 cleavage is the crease between a womans breasts that shows in their tops like the ones your mother is always wearing
1132050 dad told me what cleavage is but its still doesnt make any sense
1132051 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1132052 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1132053 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1132054 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1132055 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1132056 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1132057 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1132058 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1132059 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1132060 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1132061 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1132062 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1132063 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1132064 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1132065 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1132066 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1132067 with gas hovering around 4 a gallon even the crossover category continues to show signs of slowdown as many consumers looking to replace traditional trucks are experiencing falling resale value of their old vehicles freezing buyers out of the crossover market and pushing them to look at options such as compact and midsize cars
1132068 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

1132080 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1132081 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1132082 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1132083 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1132084 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1132085 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1132086 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1132087 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1132088 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1132089 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1132090 who are open to doing something on the production side
1132091 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1132092 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1132093 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1132094 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1132095 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1132096 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

1132102 eddie mcguire club president espouses that he believes in law and order and that drink driving is a crime
1132103 he is always the first to come out and make a public statement but when it comes to the crunch at his own football club its double standards
1132104 would eddie drop this guy if he had injured someone or worse it sends a good message to the collingwood membership that its ok to drink and drive as long as you are a collingwood footballer
1132105 these guys are role models and should pay a higher price but collingwood has its own rules when it comes to drink driving and obviously the rest of the community has to sing to a different tune
1132106 the easiest thing in the world for our club is to send him down to play in the vfl reserves and he gets off the hook
1132107 what we want him to do now is start his rehabilitation people can say it is just being selfish because we are about to play in a big game against st kilda
1132108 well our supporters deserve these professional people to do their job properly

1132113 we should not ignore or conceal the deaths of unarmed civilians that resulted from systematic aerial bombing and strafing
1132114 the presence of too many foreigners gathered outside could create problems
1132115 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1132116 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1132117 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1132118 simply put alan has been put on notice as of today
1132119 that without pre empting the outcome it is very likely they a breach would have an immediate and ultimate outcome on the termination of alans contract alan is very clear from this meeting that it will be a turning point in his career in either direction clear lines have been drawn in the sand
1132120 right now the way im feeling is that if we played a game right now against st kilda and the st kilda boys roughed him up and were into him at the first bounce im not too sure if id be over there to support him to tell you the truth youve done it you cop it
1132121 i know once i get to saturday night were definitely all in it together
1132122 faith moves mountains but only knowledge moves them to the right place

1132139 is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and manufacture of extremely small electronic circuits and mechanical devices built at the molecular level
1132140 we believe that credits and incentives are critical to spur consumer adoption of the technology
1132141 we need a new vision for energy for 2050 maybe even before that
1132142 a continuous cable of buckytubes that we expect will conduct electricity 10 times better than copper yet have only one sixth the weight a zero coefficient of thermal expansion and a tensile strength greater than steel
1132143 if we succeed well be able to rewire the world replacing aluminum and copper in virtually every application and permitting a vast increase in the capacity of the nations electrical grid that and the development of plug in electric hybrid vehicles will enable us to wean ourselves away from gasoline for the bulk of our urban transportation needs free us from dependency on middle east oil and greatly improve the air quality in the cities throughout the world
1132144 for energy efficient products weve seen nano applications going into window coatings lighting and lightweight vehicles and we want to improve fuel cells and supercapacitors there are huge possibilities
1132145 with the energy gains we do have to have the economic benefits if you look at just the energy sector energy generation storage and efficiency lux research is predicting that there will be over 20 billion dollars of goods produced with nanotechnology by 2012
1132146 this environmentally friendly glass pays for itself because of nanomanufacturing technology
1132147 theres a clear relationship between vehicle weight and fuel consumption
1132148 if we go beyond thinking lightweight to thinking ultra lightweight with nanocomposite technology thats how well get there and we are making progress
1132149 in principle if we can make the single walled carbon nanotubes into these fibers we can go up to factors of somewhere around 40
1132150 so we could in principle make extremely strong composites strong enough so that even a texan in an suv
1132151 and if you make it a plug in hybrid the gasoline consumption would be more like sipping gas
1132152 our goal is to work with industry and work with our national labs to try to get this technology to make a difference in consumers lives today
1132153 we leverage the significant investment in nanoscience and build the manufacturing capability to deliver products to the american people

1132155 we want everybody to have an understanding of what intellectual property is and more importantly why we have intellectual property and not just what it is
1132156 cant even afford to send her popular daughter to cheerleading camp
1132157 its very tough to explain to somebody the importance of copyright until they understand the concept of intellectual property which if you ask an eight year old straight up they dont know
1132158 you have to be awfully young awfully na ve or awfully both to believe in free anything
1132159 i hope most of them have library cards and recognize that they can go into their public libraries and pull plenty of useful and fun books off the shelves

1132163 even payment to the artist was only incidental to encouraging artists and authors to produce new works and give them to the public
1132164 schools dont spend their time teaching kids about speed limits either
1132165 when they get out on the road they learn how to obey the speed limit
1132166 the individual educator to decide where the lesson would fit best for their students
1132167 these regulations are an important step to removing an unnecessary barrier to the implementation of programs that allow employers to retain the services of older workers who want to phase down their work in preparation for full retirement
1132168 phased retirement permits an employer to retain the services of an experienced employee while also providing the employee with the opportunity to continue active employment at a level that also allows greater flexibility and time away from work people are living longer healthier lives so we need to encourage programs which not only reduce the risk that individuals may outlive their retirement savings but also retain this valuable and productive part of our workforce

1132173 we chose the tongue to operate the system because unlike hands and feet which are controlled by the brain through the spinal cord the tongue is directly connected to the brain by a cranial nerve that generally escapes damage in severe spinal cord injuries or neuromuscular diseases
1132174 tongue movements are also fast accurate and do not require much thinking concentration or effort
1132175 light is collected over a large area like a window and gathered or concentrated at the edges
1132176 the system will allow much faster analysis of complex problems like understanding and predicting how the power grid behaves one of the most complex engineering systems ever built
1132177 other researchers have developed ways to produce hydrogen with mind boggling efficiency but their approaches are very high cost
1132178 such photocorrosion stable diodes generate a photocurrent of approximately 0 25 milliampere per centimeter square at a photoconversion efficiency of 0 30 percent
1132179 these devices are inexpensive and because they are photo stable could last for years
1132180 i believe that efficiencies of 5 to 10 percent are reasonable
1132181 the wave fronts are slightly perturbed as they pass around the container
1132182 because the wave fronts dont match exactly we refer to the technique as approximate cloaking
1132183 we will see more and more of this sort of thing for many other types of instruments that are being used around the world
1132184 this allows researchers to spend more time doing research and less time and money developing simulations
1132185 the need for sustainability arose from the recognition that the profligate extravagant and inequitable nature of current patterns of development when projected into the not too distant future lead to biophysical impossibilities
1132186 development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
1132187 a process of change in which the exploitation of resources the direction of investments the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potentials to meet human needs and aspirations
1132188 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1132189 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1132190 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1132191 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1132192 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1132193 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1132194 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1132195 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1132196 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1132197 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1132198 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1132199 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1132200 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1132201 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1132202 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1132203 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1132204 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1132205 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1132206 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1132207 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1132208 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1132209 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1132210 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1132211 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1132212 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1132213 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1132214 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1132215 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1132216 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1132217 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1132218 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1132219 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1132220 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1132221 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1132222 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1132223 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1132224 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1132225 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1132226 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1132227 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1132228 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1132229 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1132230 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission

1132232 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1132233 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1132234 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1132235 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1132236 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1132237 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

1132249 it becomes its not just our union it becomes a political message theyre trying to get out
1132250 if i had my preference i wouldnt bring politics into it but we just cant lose the moment and the opportunity when so many friends and family are together

1132253 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1132254 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples
1132255 and so far none of our blood relatives or straight friends have actually contributed any money

1132273 como socialistas nos oponemos al modelo de agencias que impulsa el jefe de gobierno porque el objeto que persigue es cortar la cadena de responsabilidad evitando que llegue hasta l y manejar con total discrecionalidad los fondos p blicos es una barbaridad que se ponga en manos de un rgano por fuera del gobierno toda la informaci n sensible de la gesti n p blica y encima se lo autorice a vender sus servicios a terceros y a conveniar esos datos con instituciones privadas nacionales y extranjeras

1132289 no la quiero contradecir diputada pero hay bancas vac as por todos lados
1132290 la agencia tiene como objetivo organizar y coordinar con todas las dependencias del gobierno de la ciudad la infraestructura inform tica de telecomunicaciones y de los sistemas de informaci n dotando a la ciudad de un plan autosuficiente razonable y coordinado de gobierno electr nico que permita el acceso del ciudadano por medios electr nicos y telef nicos a los servicios de informaci n de gobierno aportando transparencia a la gesti n
1132291 existen en el gobierno de la ciudad una gran proliferaci n de reas de sistemas que trabajan en forma aislada en compartimentos independientes uno del otro produci ndose una gran atomizaci n de los grupos de trabajo la falta de integraci n dentro de cada ministerio y de ellos con el resto de las dependencias del gobierno generando una ineficiencia en los recursos proliferaci n de tecnolog as ausencia de metodolog a de desarrollo de proyectos inexistencia de un plan de sistema integral entre otros aspectos que demuestran una alto grado de dispersi n de recursos escasos
1132292 deber organizarse y funcionar tendiendo a incorporar la metodolog a de gesti n de proyectos para organizar y coordinar por s o por terceros recursos concernientes a sistemas de informaci n telecomunicaciones e infraestructura inform tica en la administraci n p blica de la ciudad promover la estandarizaci n de los bienes inform ticos equipos recursos sistemas y programas a ser utilizados por el gobierno de la ciudad asistir a trav s del uso e incorporaci n de tecnolog as de informaci n y comunicaciones en el proceso de organizaci n funcional de las instituciones de la ciudad fomentando y facilitando la participaci n de los actores interesados en la modernizaci n innovaci n optimizaci n y descentralizaci n de la funci n p blica y propender al uso de tecnolog as basadas en est ndares abiertos y de libre disponibilidad entre otras funciones
1132293 la creaci n de un organismo descentralizado no es garant a para afrontar la gran proliferaci n de reas de sistemas que trabajan en forma aislada o en otras palabras la ausencia de integridad sist mica en reas claves de gobierno por el contrario ha de ser la reconstrucci n de la capacidad de coordinaci n intersectorial e interministerial la mejor v a para enfrentar este desaf o

1132295 esto se puede llevar adelante con una direcci n ya existente la direcci n general de sistemas de informaci n con la creaci n de esta agencia no hacemos m s que aumentar la estructura no estamos impactando directamente en las pol ticas de informatizaci n del gobierno de la ciudad
1132296 es una barbaridad que se ponga en manos de un rgano por fuera del gobierno toda la informaci n sensible de la gesti n p blica y encima se lo autorice a vender sus servicios a terceros esta ltima posibilidad finalmente fue eliminada del texto sancionado y a conveniar esos datos con instituciones privadas nacionales y extranjeras
1132297 los fundamentos del proyecto son p simos y los ejemplos que da equivocados la iniciativa es mala y votar en contra es lo mejor
1132298 la creaci n de la agencia de sistemas de informaci n no tiene ning n sentido el poder ejecutivo que se opone a la creaci n de las comunas bas ndose en los cargos que se generar an con ellas con las diferentes agencias y el instituto de la vivienda a creado la friolera de 25 cargos pol ticos m s la posibilidad de contratar gente
1132299 la constituci n de la ciudad es muy clara respecto del modelo de reforma de estado que plantea que es a trav s de la descentralizaci n sin embargo el ejecutivo insiste en aplicar como modelo reformista no la descentralizaci n sino la creaci n de agencias las que dejan afuera el control social y la participaci n ciudadana que son los verdaderos motores de eficiencia y eficacia en gesti n gubernamental
1132300 la creaci n de una agencia de sistemas de informaci n en la ciudad con autarqu a administrativa funcional y financiera es parte de un cambio en las estructuras de gobierno en coincidencia con las nuevas tecnolog as y con las pol ticas que queremos llevar adelante
1132301 la modernizaci n de la gesti n p blica requiere asumir el problema de la adaptaci n del aparato estatal a las nuevas realidades pol ticas econ micas y sociales por eso impulsamos un modelo que modernice la infraestructura desde la profesionalizaci n del personal y el acercamiento administraci n ciudadan a
1132302 esto no se trata de la realizaci n de un principado celestial sino de una agencia que busca hacer m s eficiente la gesti n del estado
1132303 no iba a hablar pero moscariello me motiv a hacerlo si macri quiere crear una empresa que no la disfrace atr s de una agencia adem s la tendencia a denostar siempre lo p blico es una constante en los fundamentos del proyecto del ejecutivo y no estamos de acuerdo vemos los mismos problemas en torno a la informatizaci n del estado pero creemos que son necesarias distintas herramientas para solucionarlos

1132323 maybe i should just forget the screwdriver its not like the tv is about to fall over or anything im sure the next one will be faster
1132324 every time you press a button make sure you see the star on the screen
1132325 what if i cant figure out how to use this machine and have to get help from one of the store people ill feel really bad if that happens because i thought everyone else was an idiot
1132326 sorry youre in group b speedy boarding only at this time
1132327 i met this french guy and i moved here with him now we broke up so im on my own here
1132328 oh nothing really im just looking for work i was an actress back in la
1132329 oh really what kind of acting are you looking for acting work here
1132330 oh i was in this show youve probably heard of but i dont want to talk it im leaving that behind me

1132336 i really cant walk at all anymore lets just take a taxi
1132337 i dont think this cab driver knows where hes going hes going the wrong way
1132338 the kink is the corner that gets every drivers heart going
1132339 if you can get the kink right you are really gaining a lot of lap time
1132340 i didnt pick the kink because its one mean corner
1132341 i dont think any of the other guys on the team have wrecked there but i have ill take canada corner instead
1132342 its a corner where you feel your car sliding you feel the speed and you feel like you are alive
1132343 you have to have a very good car and when the car is good its quite challenging you always think you can go quicker but you discover that you cannot or you will have a big one
1132344 its very important to come out of that corner with a lot of speed because it leads onto a very fast long straight to canada corner
1132345 its a great race track and one that i really enjoy driving around
1132346 the kink is a unique turn in the american le mans series totally unlike any other corner
1132347 its flat its blind and its very fast you pick a turn in point turn the wheel and hope for the best
1132348 we want high speed downforce in the corner to give the car stability and to give the drivers confidence
1132349 you approach it in third or fourth gear and carry lot of speed into the turn about halfway through the carousel the road starts to fall away and its a real challenge to balance the car you need to have good progressive steering to keep pointing the car into the corner you dont want a darty or nervous car there because that will instantly catch you out
1132350 the carousel is a long corner and the car has to work well on the entry work well in the middle when youre a little off the power and work well when youre on the gas going out
1132351 the technique is the same as always try to do it a little better than everyone else
1132352 the feeling is almost like being in a tunnel with the trees around you
1132353 in truth road america is one of the few circuits in this country where every corner is a challenge and every corner is beautiful
1132354 there are no speed limits on the road to excellence

1132365 augustines acceptance of divine revelation the biblical plan of divine predestination with its final judgment gives a more consistent view than any other page 371
1132366 too much history to suit philosophers and too much philosophy to suit historians

1132368 the scandal of the evangelical mind is that there is not much of an evangelical mind
1132369 one must be regenerated one must be born again and the change is something logic cannot do god alone is able
1132370 too obvious to escape notice and too important to escape mention is augustines constant relating of history to ethics of ethics to theology of everything to everything so as to form a comprehensive system

1132374 the best chance weve learned is with a different city and given that were talking 20 to 30 years before we could do it again i think a lot will come down to how brisbane develops in terms of further infrastructure hotels and whatever by then
1132375 i couldnt and wouldnt say to the queensland government or the brisbane city council to go out and build a new swimming pool but infrastructure is important villages in the past have been around university sites for instance it would be smart to at least have somewhere in mind but certainly i wouldnt be counselling them to go building anything because what you build now would be outdated by then

1132395 these have to be the nicest people ive ever met

1132425 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1132426 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1132427 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1132428 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1132435 to read the hundreds of online reactions to that initial post you would see prozanski swiftly pilloried as to pick a few insults at random an uninformed and spineless poor soul with his head in a bucket
1132436 there may be some other ways to tell a few idiots that their head may be worth more to them that they think
1132437 i feel that ms nielsens comments about the discussion on bikeportland irresponsibly indulged in an opportunity to take a cheap shot at the for the most part thoughtful respectful tone of the comments about this issue posted on this weblog
1132438 not something i would expect in the oregonians news section
1132439 further the overall tone of the article feels biased against those folks who are opposing a mandatory helmet law for adult cyclists
1132440 overall i find it sad to see the oregonian continuing to depict recent news stories related to cycling and cyclists in a black and white manner often stereotyping cyclists and framing the issues as
1132441 fair enough lets move on still its sad to see an interesting policy idea crushed with so little public policy discussion you have to wonder where were headed if people need helmets to talk about helmets
1132442 its unfortunate their writing is so slanted and biased to an agenda as opposed to actual journalism

1132452 there are 68 million acres of available leases right now that are already permitted that theyre not drilling forty million of them are offshore today and theyre not using them so this is a phony argument
1132453 america only has three percent of the worlds oil reserves we can go offshore and we cant affect the price of oil and we cant affect our independence i think its phony phony phony governance theyre trying to mislead people and pretend theyre going to affect your gas price theyre not going to do that and theyre avoiding doing the things we really need to do which is put money into alternative and renewable fuels and research
1132454 its judgment youre electing for president and barack obama had the right judgment on iraq he had the right judgment on afghanistan he had the right judgment on iran and everything that he made as a judgment a year ago or two years ago now the bush administration is coming to theyre not moving to john mccains position theyre moving to barack obamas position

1132730 a lot of my favorite examples of media creativity in the past year have come out of europe which i guess isnt surprising if youre someone who believes europe with their longer tradition of unbundled media culture is a bit more media creativity enabled i really like the campaign in france for ebay cest vous ebay its you a lot of agency folks are down on tv when it comes to media creativity because of its perceived inflexibility around format but i think this campaign proves theres a lot of life in it if you can stop thinking about it in traditional ways in this campaign created by agency betc eurorscg french ebay sellers can bid on ebay tv space through an ebay auction of course to advertise the products they are selling on the auction platform ebay enables the winners to get the most value out of their auction items by enabling them to advertise their auctions through a high reach medium this is a great example of using media creativity to actually deliver a brands promise using tv to both say and do the idea is brilliant in its simplicity and brand consistency and begs the question why arent the u s ebay campaigns based on this media creativity powered construct i also really enjoyed the hostage situation turned social mash up that was diesel heidis it only lasted a week but it was clearly designed to activate the diesel brand to sell underwear in a way only diesel could this campaign was created by farfar in sweden part of the isobar network of agencies which like carat fall under the aegis family tree the simpsons movie launch by 20th century fox was a great example of media creativity featuring multiple ideas being generated off multiple media platforms they leveraged event marketing and p r in the springfield vt premiere viral online with the simpsonizer and deep experiential cross marketing with partners like 7 11 and burger king that hopefully woke everyone up to idea of impactful movie launches created by various agencies including freshworks tracy locke and crispin porter bogusky

1132759 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1132886 if oreilly hannity and beck can do that so can i
1132887 i had to make sure that i got the pitches in and rely on the field to get the outs out
1132888 i believe in the first two games because we were making errors i wasnt too confident in the fielding but after i saw them fielding the ball and with the few hits the crushers had i got a little more confident so i started to pitch a little bit more
1132889 we have to stay ahead because these are two good teams at it and we cant afford to let them get the upper hand on us

1132897 weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate
1132898 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1132899 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1132900 if we can understand how we got into this relatively cold climate phase then that can help predict how global warming might push us back out of this phase
1132901 studies like ours that establish when and how climate thresholds were crossed along the way can be used to predict climate thresholds going the opposite direction from cool to warm
1132902 although to be fair were looking at one that is very far away warming would have to be greater than what is predicted for the next one or two centuries to cause a melting of the east antarctic ice sheet the west antarctic ice sheet is much more vulnerable
1132903 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived

1132920 its not a setback hes over there and getting ready so its obviously all part of the plan
1132921 theres no doubt in my view hes still one year into a five year deal and i think that needs to be banged home pretty strongly
1132922 id like to think when the times are a little tough the sponsors are going to stick with us
1132923 ive said a number of times the club will come out the other end and we want to hope as many of our sponsors and supporters stick with us through the tough times
1132924 were working at speed with the nrl and our respective legal teams to determine our next steps
1132925 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1132926 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1132927 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1132928 simply put alan has been put on notice as of today
1132929 that without pre empting the outcome it is very likely they a breach would have an immediate and ultimate outcome on the termination of alans contract alan is very clear from this meeting that it will be a turning point in his career in either direction clear lines have been drawn in the sand

1132934 today there are many treatment options including bariatric surgery if necessary to lower the fat content in the body before you start giving insulin
1132935 the fat is causing insulin resistance and killing the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas that is what is causing type 2 diabetes
1132936 giving more insulin to an insulin resistant patient is akin to raising the blood pressure of a patient with high blood pressure to overcome resistance to blood flow instead you would try to reduce the resistance

1133077 id be really surprised if he just didnt pay attention that just wouldnt be like him

1133087 when the world media was portraying kenya as a country engulfed by ethnic hatred and mass violence there were many people in all walks of society whose first thought was what can we do to help in this crisis
1133088 we as writers could not have escaped that question we had to do something and the only skill we could use to help our people was to write

1133091 the western media never show the mutilated blood soaked bodies of the victims of terrorist attacks of say september 11 or of the 2005 london bombings why take a different approach to kenyas tragedy

1133303 weve kind of had the perfect storm the last few months the slowdown is taking hold more broadly
1133304 much of the slowdown is tied to the housing downturn and cutbacks in consumer spending which are deepening as the economy slumps and prices for gas and other goods rise

1133322 i am thrilled by this success and the strong support of the olympic family so far of course we want to go much further now the bigger impact we can make with this campaign the better i am convinced that with our common efforts we can collect many more items
1133323 i am confident that many of my colleagues will recognise the value of this project and be eager to contribute it really is so easy to participate sport has given a lot to all of us and it is great to be able to give a little back by bringing joy to refugees
1133324 refugee youth have often suffered terribly and witnessed war first hand some refugees are born in camps others grow up in camps which can mean a lifetime with little or no access to sport or recreation the gift of sportswear from olympic athletes around the globe inspires refugees and connects them to the world of sports beyond happiness it brings them hope

1133326 the mere fact that the olympic games are coming to china home to nearly 20 percent of the worlds population is significant
1133327 improve the quality of life and contribute to chinas economic development over the long term
1133328 we should also enhance our efforts to promote olympic values worldwide the olympic rings are a powerful symbol recognized worldwide because they represent a set of universal values it is our job to keep those values alive and thriving in a changing world
1133329 i am also confident that we are about to experience a magnificent olympic games when the games start this weekend we can join the rest of the world in watching the worlds best athletes as they compete in a forum that celebrates fair play olympic values and friendship

1133333 unaids is very pleased with it collaboration with the ioc and bocog

1133361 johns been a celebrity ever since he was shot down
1133362 obama has almost transcended that and has become famous as a famous person which is why they are comparing him to paris hilton
1133363 you can definitely makes the case that mccain stands out among republicans for his associations with hollywood and his celebrity status
1133364 the fact that he was in wedding crashers it underscores the fact that he does have a lot of friends in the entertainment industry that bush cant claim
1133365 john mccain is a widely respected and admired political leader in our country and the world

1133380 sil pleut la saint m dard il pleuvra 40 jours plus tard sauf si saint barnab vient lui couper le pied
1133381 i think players react differently he had a major injury every professional athlete reacts differently i think strength and conditioning coach rich dalatri and athletic trainer timmy walsh are among the best in the business so i dont think thats correct at all
1133382 no not unless we wanted to pay him what he wanted he showed in the two months before the injury two years ago what he could do but that was one third of the year our feeling was we werent willing to pay at the level he wanted we did try to some sign and trades we came close
1133383 now i can see the nets did a totally wrong rehab with me because now i feel great
1133384 during the season my knee was swelling and everything now im doing practice twice a day and no swelling i feel great
1133385 i lost like 10 pounds i think im coming back im feeling really normal i think the nets did a not so good job with me thats why i recovered slowly
1133386 i have a strength and conditioning coach here who really has experience with this injury im doing every day with him twice a day exercises in the weight room and on the court i feel so much better im happy for that
1133387 my muscle and my quad was not strong enough thats why the knee swelled up small things in the weight room and just small things on the court when i had the setback last summer it all affects you
1133388 i need to be satisfied its not the nba but its more money than i can get right now in the nba and its a good league there are a lot of nba players coming in the russian league my opinion is its the second best league in europe right now
1133389 yes i was upset because nobody really offered me something good
1133390 i had an offer from cleveland but it was much less money than russia i was ready to take less money and stay in the nba but nobody really offered me something and everybody knows i had the deadline with the russian team
1133391 in one way i didnt want to lose that money
1133392 its like playing for 10 million in the nba or 20 million for two years theres no tax its tax free i didnt want to lose that
1133393 marc told me its going to be a long process nobody really wants me everyone is asking about my knee about my health nobody really wants me i was a little upset i wanted to stay in the nba but i didnt want to leave that thats a lot of money on the table
1133394 i understand my situation and my position but i think when you look at big guys in the nba they signed really big contract i know i am on that level
1133395 i know im healthy right now i took that like disrespect to accept that offer from an nba team only because its an nba team i didnt want to do that i know im going to feel bad during the season that im not in the nba but i made the decision that i didnt want to do that and take the russian deal right now
1133396 chicago was pushing but they said they needed a couple more days
1133397 i talked to marc and we decided its too much risk to give them a couple more days what if they say they changed our minds and i lost the deal in russia
1133398 i have my option to buy out im going to try to play really good in russia and see whats going to happen
1133399 i made a long career out of playing the game the right way and playing hard
1133400 defensively im old school i believe defense is what wins games ive come from a team that put up more than 100 points and we never really got anywhere scoring 140 160 points it didnt do anything for us
1133401 i think that i provide that for this team im going to be as physical as i can and im going to push the rookies im sure theyll probably hate me during training camp but thats preparation you need for the season
1133402 i played all 82 games last year and 81 the year before
1133403 my surgery was in 06 normally it takes 1 to 2 years to mentally get back from the surgery i think im there
1133404 i havent found the right role for me to be in and relish like i want to
1133405 im fully healed no recurring injuries and im looking forward to the opportunity
1133406 i did have a lot of attention from different teams
1133407 im just ready to come to the eastern conference and start experiencing the other side of the nba world im really excited i was being followed by teams like dallas and denver theyre proven theyre winning teams the last few years but if you think about it we barely made the playoffs dallas barely made the playoffs then you see the other teams like new orleans they turned it around real fast all they needed was a young talented guy that came in and led the way thats what im looking on this team to kind of fit in on the right atmosphere and try and win ballgames
1133408 in denver i was playing freestyle basketball here is going to be more disciplined i think i will fit in even better if you play the game the right way i can throw in the utah jazz very disciplined stay within their concept i assume thats going to be us next year and if we do it we will have a very good chance
1133409 but at the end of the day the opportunity to come to a team and have the opportunity to play for me i couldnt pass up detroit was great we made it to the eastern conference finals a couple of games short of the finals the experiences i had there from working hard i think its priceless i think im ready to take that step here for a more expanded role
1133410 with the trade and all that stuff they thought they were going to get better
1133411 i dont see how they got better we got the young talented players
1133412 before we evaluate players the first thing we look at is character second is competitiveness and along with that is love and passion for the game
1133413 we have a lot of guys of character in this locker room but we want to make sure any addition we make to the team fulfills those requirements its important it doesnt take a genius to figure out look at the teams in front of us boston detroit san antonio not only do they have talented players but theyre people of character because the nba season the length the bumps in the road you need people of character to go through those bumps so were excited about the players we added we think theyll help us
1133414 the first part of the quote is the key they want guys who are competitive and have a love and passion for the game and openly show it
1133415 in denver i was playing freestyle basketball here is going to be more disciplined i think i will fit in even better if you play the game the right way i can throw in the utah jazz very disciplined stay within their concept i assume thats going to be us next year and if we do it we will have a very good chance
1133416 the nenad krstic part of the equation has not been decided yet we have to see what happens with him we still have a lot of power forwards for instance well still look to make some other moves before training camp
1133417 it will probably be around the edges whatever we do from here on out i would think
1133418 but weve had so many conversations over the last month and a half most of them never went anywhere but you never know when they will
1133419 i dont know because at the present time i dont think the marketplace here the only place we could a sign and trade is where he would like it to be
1133420 if that remains the same which it may or may not i think hell probably look more to a foreign team
1133421 i would expect within the next couple weeks they will figure out which way to go
1133422 we didnt have as many good players as we have now
1133423 we urge that no impediments are put in its way and that its passage can come quickly and smoothly the issues in this bill are not controversial and they have broad bipartisan support attaching non germane issues to the veterans funding bill that serve to delay or block passage would truly be wrong
1133424 the calgary stampeders are pleased that the cfl reacted in a fast and expedient manner with this situation
1133425 we respect their decision and were glad that jojuan armour was vindicated and are pleased that jojuan can rejoin the team for next thursdays game
1133426 we can confirm it did not make it to its final destination
1133427 hes been flying with us for a few years in that area
1133428 our hearts go out to the families involved and thats our priority now
1133429 we offer our deepest sympathies to the families and will be working with them and the two seaspan survivors to provide grief and trauma counselling
1133430 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
1133431 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
1133432 any discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement
1133433 but in the years now months run up to the olympics the reality has been numbingly disappointing
1133434 i suppose it was just a bunch of words when they made those promises
1133435 china is a responsible country we will fulfill the promises we made for the olympics
1133436 the ideas out there that china made commitments on human rights but its simply not true
1133437 nobody was in any mood to make any promises then
1133438 hes been dealing with this shoulder problem for a long time
1133439 going in to repair the problem is his best chance now to open up next year feeling 100 percent
1133440 the good news is his back feels great and his left shoulder is not a problem
1133441 it seems like those two issues have been addressed going through an offseason last year and rehabbing three different surgeries at once was not easy this time hell be able to focus on just one thing
1133442 anytime you have a player of his caliber youd always love him to be in your lineup
1133443 but looking at him getting this behind him and ready to contribute on a daily basis next year is exciting
1133444 hey brother christian with your high and mighty errand your actions speak

1133463 mythological representations have been neither invented nor freely accepted the products of a process independent of thought and will they were for the consciousness which underwent them of an irrefutable and incontestable reality peoples and individuals are only the instruments of this process which goes beyond their horizon and which they serve without understanding

1133467 myth is a word chosen by history it could not come from the nature of things
1133468 was applied to capture and seize by force of reason qualities of thought which eluded it on every side
1133469 what puts an end to this caricature of certain speeches from may 1968 is among other things precisely the fact that roles are not distributed once and for all in myths as would be the case if they were a variant of the idea of an opium of the people
1133470 myth therefore seems to choose history rather than be chosen by it
1133471 beyond words and stories myth seems more like a psychic content from which words gestures and musics radiate history only chooses for it more or less becoming clothes and these contents surge forth all the more vigorously from the nature of things when reason tries to repress them whatever the roles and commentaries with which such and such a socio historic movement decks out the mythic image the latter lives a largely autonomous life which continually fascinates humanity to denounce archaism only makes sense as a function of a progressive ideology which itself begins to show a certain archaism and an obvious naivety
1133472 for l vi strauss myth is a structured system of signifiers whose internal networks of relationships are used to map the structure of other sets of relationships the content is infinitely variable and relatively unimportant

1133556 in 1954 after the church dropped the ball things started to deteriorate and the cleanness and the cultural aspect we began to lose a lot of that and now what you have is a lot of other things that really have nothing to do with emancipation such as the money making racket but to a great extent is a demonstration of how much we are still enslaved at least mentally

1133626 the police have guaranteed that the jouvert will end at 7 a m
1133627 this is the main indicator that people look at for the parade to start because a lot of people who are in the jouvert are also in the parade so hopefully well have an earlier start than 2 oclock as in the past few years this year we intend to start the parade even if some people have not arrived
1133628 their entry over the last two years has been very strong
1133629 but i expect to see very close to the figures we had last year between 30 to 40 entries
1133630 one of the things the community must understand is that everything we use in the parade is based on community donations
1133631 for example a lot of the flatbeds we get from tropical shipping a lot of other people who pitch in and join the parade when the business day closes on friday that is when the activity really starts coming together there are lots of variables after the business day closes when you can confirm the donation of trucks and other things

1133642 het zijn simpele dingen maar daar kijken we z naar uit
1133643 i was unlucky i couldnt be in the side i couldnt play the only thing i could do was watch tv and watching the games sat in armchair made me even more depressed
1133644 i never expected to be out for so long i didnt know what to do to make things better
1133645 what i dont understand is how up until a given day i was an example to others and then all of a sudden id become like diego maradona when he was at the centre of controversy
1133646 when im holiday i do what i want during the season i behave like a serious professional i never have any slip ups
1133647 i do the maximum to be a good athlete but when the seasons over i enjoy life
1133648 my family have protected me and given me strength and theyve suffered too because the abuse has not only been aimed at me but also at my brother roberto who is also my agent
1133649 theyve accused him of creating instability of staying close to me only for the money and other things whose sole aim is to hurt me
1133650 now im with brazil and here to play the olympics
1133651 im here to lend a hand to my friends to try and do something historic for the brazilians who have never won olympic gold
1133652 we have been busy for three weeks now and in those weeks we gave every player their chance
1133653 in some cases that has led to new vision and that is why we have made some players clear on their position
1133654 the transfer window closes at the end of the month and we expect something will happen with some of our players
1133655 we want to work with a selection of 24 players
1133656 unfortunately despite all the good results we havent been able to win anything
1133657 im going into my fourth year im captain so theres a certain recognition i identify myself with this club that i loved when i was kid
1133658 that doesnt necessarily mean that im going to stay here for the rest of my career
1133659 from that starting point well see what happens but staying at valencia is his first choice
1133660 after that if other opportunities arise then well analyse them but at the moment hes very happy here
1133661 if in the next few days anything comes up which changes that then well have to weigh it up and make a decision
1133662 david wants to stay and he has a contract lots of clubs have shown an interest in him for that reason he wants valencia to show him that they value him
1133663 its normal that theres interest because hes a player whos had two very good seasons he played at euro 2008 and did really well and its normal that there are offers for a player who has stood out like that
1133664 i really think were going to shock a lot of people and go on to make history by finishing among the top three nations
1133665 i believe it and i know rest of the boys share that belief now were here in china theres a huge buzz around the place and you know youre about to be a part of something very big
1133666 we arent afraid of anybody here and we want to show them what australian football is all about
1133667 we might have lost those warm up matches but we played really well against japan and korea and created enough chances to have won both games comfortably
1133668 were better prepared than any team weve ever sent to the olympics and i think thats going to count for a lot
1133669 in 2004 we qualified through oceania and that meant far easier games against the island nations this team has had to progress through asia and its been a long hard road and the standard is just so much higher
1133670 in that respect were a better team than four years ago and hopefully it will give us an edge were quite battle hardened
1133671 our second game is against argentina and we cant afford to go into that one without any points on the board it would leave us with a mountain to climb
1133672 there wont be any second chances for any of us and i can tell you well give it a real good shake

1133722 the connections to the dugway proving ground army research center are still uncertain said law enforcement officials and scientists dugway may be the source of the anthrax with investigators trying to match the precise genetic fingerprints from the anthrax first found in the offices of a florida tabloid to those used at dugway or officials said dugway could be the source for the know how necessary to make the bacteria so deadly 10 to 100 times more concentrated than the anthrax usually used in research
1133723 the fbi is pursuing the possibility that financial gain was the motive behind the mailing of letters containing deadly anthrax bacteria and has conducted extensive interviews of personnel at two laboratories and possibly more according to government officials
1133724 battelle a private contractor that has worked with the pentagon in developing defenses against biological attacks is one of several labs visited by fbi agents investigating the anthrax attacks

1133727 there is an increasing capability of the iraqi security forces
1133728 they have grown tremendously even in the 11 months weve been here the capability of the iraqi security force has certainly contributed both the army and the police the sons of iraq are part of the security elements in the northern provinces and they have helped in some areas like hawijah samarra and some other places
1133729 are starting to get their act together and providing jobs for people
1133730 were starting to transition those elements into other organizations such as a civil service corps to help rebuild roads pipelines projects things like that
1133731 but were also seeing microgrants and microloans take charge and people actually getting normal work

1133744 once youre president everything changes there are wholly are different set of pressures and wholly different consistencies
1133745 youre no longer representing illinois or arizona but a national political party and an entire nation

1133747 he cant lose his base but at the same time he cant just default to the base and let it lead him
1133748 the conventional wisdom is that people who serve in congress learn to compromise to cut back
1133749 but if you look at lyndon b johnson who was the master of the senate and john f kennedy they were both strong executives

1133757 immigration is such an emotional issue and there are no clear answers
1133758 on this difficult and dangerous issue they are looking at the pressure from their parties
1133759 mccain has been indisputably a visible champion and put his career on the line he has the edge as far as legislative experience
1133760 is not a win win for him hes going to get the reform vote anyway and because its an issue where you can alienate a lot of potential voters moderates and cross overs
1133761 theyll expect the states will enact anti immigration laws and theyll be kicked up to the supreme court to be decided
1133762 mccain is much more emotionally committed to pushing amnesty amnesty for him is not businesses anymore its personal
1133763 its not all that important to obama hes more likely than mccain to give up
1133764 contorted his position he has painted himself against a wall
1133765 hes handed a veto to governors who will not play a weak kneed game this precondition pretty much makes comprehensive immigration overhaul impossible

1133811 im strongly encouraged by senator obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1133812 when i started this campaign my goal was to make this the biggest issue in the coming election and the top priority to be addressed in the first hundred days of the next administration this issue is clearly moving up in the priority of political debate senator obamas statement is an indication that is what is indeed happening i will continue to push this as a priority for the rest of the year

1133844 the purpose is to draw attention to the fact that the speaker of the house adjourned for a five week vacation without addressing the most important issue facing america today
1133845 i understand fully well that its only part of the solution
1133846 the democrats who are saying you cant drill your way out of this correct if all youre doing is drilling what i would say is you cant get out of the energy crisis without drilling
1133847 no amount of showboating on the house floor will change that or convince people hes going to bring something different to the table
1133848 to imply that im in the pocket of any organization is certainly insulting and wrong my guess is sarvi has raised money from all sorts of groups am i to assume that everybody who has contributed to him has somehow bought him no

1133851 they beazer homes are in control of the site at this point and anything that arises out of that theyll have to try to resolve with the folks involved in the accident
1133852 as far as the county goes there is no standards that beazer is not meeting in terms of having a fence or barrier around a portion of the site that is not currently under construction
1133853 i just smile so happy it gets 50 miles to the gallon
1133854 4 a gallon for gas is killing working families hurting business driving up food prices and im tired of being in a congress thats broken
1133855 there will be in the next decade to 15 years a revolution in technology when it comes to operating cars that will make us less dependent on foreign oil and this bill starts that process
1133856 its hurting everyone the gas crunch the better gas mileage getting the oil off shore its going to help everyone

1133867 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course
1133868 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1133869 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts
1133870 that certainly is a golf course ive got a lot of good memories around
1133871 i havent seen it since i played it in 04
1133872 its just an incredibly tough golf course from what i remember it requires all the shots
1133873 youve got to move the ball left to right right to left you need to hit it long you need to hit it straight you need to putt well these are just some of the most difficult greens ive ever seen so it takes absolutely everything
1133874 i guess the riaa is getting nervous about the ability of its national law firm in charge of bringing ex parte motions securing default judgments and beating up grandmothers and children to handle the
1133875 ok ive been thinking about this for 20 minutes and i have no idea what this means what is fps
1133876 we can hope we can meet those targets and make the 9 95 a month
1133877 my assumption is because of the way the market has operated with retailers have a monopoly on the sale of extended service plans that the price does not reflect competition in the market place or the costs associated with administering and insuring that obligation

1133879 as much as i dislike the free site at least a person can check that for themselves to see if false information is included or if a person with the same name is in the database a pain but far better than having someone secretly access the data and give a bogus reason for denying you the job apartment or whatever

1133884 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss
1133885 youve got declining home prices very tight credit conditions a soft jobs market and a weak stock market the consumer has got a lot to deal with
1133886 the rebates are not translating into anywhere near the spending impulse that congress and the administration had hoped for

1133892 it is simply unfair for any patient to receive an excessive and surprise medical bill
1133893 it is unconscionable that low income families are exposed to aggressive tactics threats to their credit and improper and coercive billing practices designed to intimidate them into making excessive payments they are not obligated to pay
1133894 families enrolled in these two programs are in low to moderate income working families already struggling to make ends meet
1133895 they should never be charged more than their co pay just because through no fault of their own they ended up with an out of network radiologist or anesthesiologist
1133896 they say says the lord when the lord has not sent them and yet they wait for the fulfillment of their word

1133902 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1133903 we stand to greatly improve our models of fluid circulation and heat and mass transfer
1133904 temperatures are so high much of drilling equipment would melt and joins would not work anymore
1133905 the high temperature of the venting is especially interesting as this mid ocean ridge does not spread very rapidly
1133906 so one can presume that this portion of the south mid atlantic ridge is in a very magmatic phase and has been for a few years
1133907 the explanation could be that theres lot of magma but after a few more years of high temperatures its going to get to the point where it will be embarrassing how much magma there needs to be to maintain them for that long
1133908 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me
1133909 were thrilled and honored that chris has accepted our invitation for mid ohio con 2008
1133910 with such an influential body of work its hard to overstate claremonts contribution to comics overall and the x men in particular
1133911 mid ohio con is now just two months away and with our new show dates great programming schedule and incredible roster of guests we are seeing a strong response from retailers publishers and other exhibitors

1133917 i have heard about it but dont know all the details just yet furner said
1133918 i dont want to say too much until we know more and we will certainly be looking into the matter first thing in the morning
1133919 i would have thought this meeting would have been his priority but i also dont want to tell others how to run their business
1133920 it riolo being away is very frustrating it means this will now drag on for a few more days we cant meet david until thursday
1133921 again it takes away from the focus of the team that can be distracting

1133925 our future lies in taking action and learning how to go from good to great we need to engage in battle with mediocrity thousands of our industry colleagues are excelling in this global marketplace because theyre going beyond the norm they have learned the secret that disciplined people thinking disciplined thoughts taking disciplined action is the winning combination you need to succeed

1133928 then clearly it should be something that you should try to do
1133929 when the cost and the time that it takes to market a home goes up why would anyone expect that those providing that service would charge less
1133930 its interesting because the music appeals on a much broader level than just the religious aspect
1133931 everyone in the band we run the gamut from agnostic to christian to jewish
1133932 i think that theres a lot of people out there that relate to gospel music not in a literal way but in a more symbolic or emotional way
1133933 i like gospel music because a lot of it is very uplifting and hopeful the stuff that isnt is very confident its refreshing to hear any kind of material thats sung in such a direct way
1133934 there will be some fundamentalist folks that will most likely be offended by us performing these tunes in a bar and in clubs
1133935 we thought people would think it was weird or wouldnt be into it cause they wanted something to get drunk to

1133943 al mes de que ella es secuestrada se encuentra una notita en santiago del estero cerca de las termas un papelito muy chiquitito lo encuentra una turista quien pens que era una broma pero como justo en ese momento se estaba dando difusi n ella se lo lleva al juez y en la nota dec a

1133970 can my vote count for two or something since im a celebrity
1133971 he was like im the most hated on so he wanted to do a mixtape with me kind of like the two most hated on or something like that
1133972 everybody is always picking on us anyway we might just go head and kill the game and sh on all these n as do a mixtape album together put it out and go hard
1133973 were a little apprehensive since the last one was a hoax
1133974 looking beyond this initial deployment our mutual goal is to have 10 000 kiosks installed within 18 months
1133975 the cardiology division was in contact with dr masoudi this morning he and his wife and oldest daughter were uninjured
1133976 he has two children that were in the house that was hit by the plane
1133977 they told us they were in the house and they were killed
1133978 we are just all devastated as far as we know the children are not alive
1133979 she will be greatly missed and i wish her the best of luck in her retirement
1133980 when you ask for the works it consists of certain vegetables on your sandwich it does not include mayonnaise or mustard
1133981 he tasted his sandwich and it didnt have mayonnaise or mustard on it so he became upset

1133983 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president the former president told abc
1133984 i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year
1133985 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1133986 his strategic sense and his ability to run an effective campaign he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president
1133987 and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
1133988 there are things that i wished i urged her to do things i wished i said things i wished i hadnt said
1133989 i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack him personally
1133990 i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution and id be the last person to begrudge anybody their ambition
1133991 agencies that engage in discrimination retaliation harassment or violations of federal discrimination or whistleblower protection laws demonstrate a gross disregard for taxpayer dollars undermine the confidence of the american people in the government put the publics safety and services at risk and reduce the governments ability to timely and adequately address vital public needs
1133992 these two pieces of legislation are complementary but they dont overlap
1133993 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
1133994 were all about wireless were not betting on handsets were betting on jobs
1133995 because of technology challenges in the u s the only other carrier the iphone is compatible with is t mobile
1133996 the wireless technology is so radically different that apple would have to come up with an entirely new phone in order to have a product that would work on
1133997 you wouldnt even be getting the full 3g experience with t mobile
1133998 they needed someone high profile with engineering talent and certainly this guy fits the bill
1133999 the only downside is that he doesnt necessarily have any consumer products expertise
1134000 in terms of actual products hitting the street youre not going to see jhas impact before 2010
1134001 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1134002 motorola will only be successful if this new team creates a complete solution that includes hardware software and services similar to apple
1134003 while the iphone is a great phone its real value comes from its software applications and services
1134004 although creating slick phones is one part of the success equation apples success will force even traditional handset makers to think harder about the software and services angle if they are to really compete with apple head on
1134005 theres a tremendous opportunity here to take this business to the next level

1134013 concerning the military we have a long standing and excellent relationship with them as we have quite a few kfc taco bell and pizza hut stores in military bases outside the us
1134014 the secretary of state said on friday the edf deal would have been a good fit that remains our view and the parties are still in discussion our clear preference is for a business with experience of new nuclear build
1134015 in a pandemic making enough vaccine to protect everyone will take months
1134016 so we focused our research on protecting this vulnerable group because vaccination levels in these facilities among both residents and staff will be low and unlike acute care hospitals where people constantly come and go nursing homes have a real chance at controlling access and can thereby potentially prevent a virus introduction
1134017 on the face of it it seems implausible that nonpharmaceutical measures alone would help contain a pandemic influenza
1134018 overall we found that conventional npis are sufficient to curtail mild outbreaks and that higher levels of npis requiring greater social restrictions and higher levels of cooperation were needed to manage more severe outbreaks
1134019 identifying the critical role that staff plays in controlling the spread and preventing the introduction of disease in these facilities
1134020 staff members are highly overworked and underpaid and very frequently work multiple jobs to make ends meet
1134021 they are continuously challenged with the decision of going to work even when sick or losing wages by staying at home
1134022 our work shows that isolation periods are essential to control the introduction of the virus and thereby prevent a pandemic
1134023 in our view the only feasible way to implement isolation periods is if staff receive paid sick days
1134024 our work details a set of simple interventions that seem workable and that may be easily implemented by current staff members
1134025 people are really feeling the squeeze there is definitely some strain there
1134026 all i can say to you is i can assure you that hopefully youll come with me and youll get the service you deserve
1134027 as we have always maintained this legal action was to ensure that certain senior departing employees abided by the contractual obligations that they agreed to when they joined ubs and to defend ubss legitimate business interests
1134028 youll never believe this ive got goldman sachs to back it
1134029 its shaping up to be an interesting product we wont know where it scales in terms of performance until we have hardware in hand but theyve taken a number of steps to make it fit into the market
1134030 its very clear that some time ago say two or three years ago and keep in mind that back then we were hearing rumors that intel was looking at ati or nvidia as possible acquisitions but back then the decision was clearly made to develop this expertise in house
1134031 based on my past and how my last album came out i really need to come back much much stronger i wanted to have more personality i really want to tell a story when im doing a song vocally either you like my voice or you dont im not trying to blow like mariah back when she was doing that
1134032 shes fu for checks i dont f for rather live on the street
1134033 whats funny about it is when i was growing up i wasnt confused i knew exactly what i was my dads filipino my mom is mexican west indian and a little melting pot in school you were either black or white being asian really wasnt anything until i got to high school and was modeling all the time and it was important because it intrigued people black people definitely didnt claim me before they were like light skinned over there shes just not for us its all perception the other day i was at the drugstore and this girl in line was like shes next the white girl im not white im not even close

1134039 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
1134040 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
1134041 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding by travers and milgram
1134042 via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people they wrote
1134043 they could create large meshes of people who could be mobilized with the touch of a return key
1134044 israel decided to take the humanitarian decision to transfer to jericho 87 residents of the shujaiya neighbourhood in gaza because of the violence carried out by hamas
1134045 we talked with them on the bus and we told them that jericho and the west bank are different from the gaza strip and that the israeli army controls this region they have to respect the law
1134046 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1134047 we never wanted anyone to leave in this regrettable way
1134048 this is a path that does harm to them because by the mere act of fleeing a person places himself in the realm of suspicion
1134049 we condemn the criminal acts undertaken by the hamas leadership against the palestinian people in shujaiya in gaza
1134050 these criminal acts have forced a number of people to flee to israel including women and children and so president abbas has called on a number of parties to rescue those who are in danger from the hamas militia
1134051 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women
1134052 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
1134053 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
1134054 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
1134055 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
1134056 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
1134057 this bill does little more than dole out favors to the democrats trial lawyer allies with no new benefit to protect workers
1134058 more difficult and error prone and invite a surge of litigation
1134059 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me
1134060 we need to take care of it for our tourism industry but the big problem is not on the beach its whats happening in the seas
1134061 human caused stresses including global warming and overfishing are encouraging jellyfish surpluses in many tourist destinations and productive fisheries
1134062 in the past few years the dynamic has changed completely the temperature is a little warmer
1134063 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
1134064 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
1134065 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
1134066 would be able to know that you have a very high near intractable cholesterol problem
1134067 though most people tell the truth most of the time there are people out there who dont who leave out something thats incredibly relevant who may even be able to defraud a company
1134068 thats important because ultimately the people who tell the truth have to pay for those who dont
1134069 i had a patient on amitriptyline for migraines and they were denied life insurance because its also an antidepressant
1134070 i had to explain it wasnt being used for depression
1134071 i wrote an appeal letter and they still wouldnt give it to her
1134072 weve got to stop these practices before the marketplace is fully developed and patients lose all control over their medical information
1134073 a lot of insurance companies are starting to use this type of data
1134074 they said all right prescription data is working lets go and look at other types of data too its because of the success of one that were going after others
1134075 the message that it is okay to ignore the law
1134076 but consumers will likely continue to have no real meaningful choices if they want insurance
1134077 ooh this is a 60 minutes story in the making generally they wanted to make it a super secret database restricted to underwriting
1134078 theres a huge case for it being opened up for all legitimate access
1134079 but republicans views on the war on drugs are completely antithetical to the libertarian ethos
1134080 and sometimes accused of being a libertarian to which i say im guilty i love liberty
1134081 when you have divided party government you have more vigorous oversight
1134082 to assess the oversight of one year can take several years
1134083 it would be wrong to ascribe these accomplishments to the congressional hearings but without question those hearings in 1994 had a galvanizing effect
1134084 one thing that is clear is that there is a heckuva lot more oversight than there was before 2006
1134085 the threat enhanced by the armed ethnic conflicts raging in the countrys tribal areas which supply about a quarter of musharrafs soldiers
1134086 the north west frontier province or the nwfp the province and political base of rahman is breaking away from pakistan that is what is happening that is the reality

1134089 we were in yorkville and thats where i lived it was good to be back over there no hard feelings it was just time to move on
1134090 i enjoyed playing here i think i played well i didnt have a super great year in 2007 but i had a very decent year last year there was no disrespect leaving it wasnt really on my terms it was one of those things where if i wasnt going to be playing there was no need for me to be here
1134091 i was right there with the guys like always under the tunnel with high fives after the game
1134092 probably just because my routine changed so much going back to oakland
1134093 here in toronto i had my bike down in the tunnel and stayed loose all the time and ready to go in oakland the clubhouse was so far away that i wasnt able to have the bike between innings and keep the body loose i think that definitely had something to do it
1134094 my goal is to continue to play at least one more year and then thats it for me probably

1134107 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1134108 there are some genuine ways in which we can provide some genuine relief to the high price in gas prices obama said today
1134109 i believe we should give every working family in america a 1 000 energy rebate and we should pay for it with part of the record profit that oil companies are making right now

1134226 i wish i was not wearing this fucking retarded hat
1134227 when i first came here i completely did not think about or worry about or care about the atomic bombing
1134228 in war you just kill your enemy and the atomic bomb is a big bomb and kills a lot of the enemy so whats wrong with that
1134229 really caused me to suddenly think about the impact of the bomb on the society that received it
1134230 now i completely consider the atomic bombings to be a war crime
1134231 those americans who are 70 years or older the ones who really hated japan during world war ii still have ambivalent feeings about japan and they dont like to hear people talking about how japan is a victim
1134232 most of them are pretty shocked many of them even have tears in their eyes sometimes
1134233 and many of them come up afterwards many of them actually apologised to her on behalf of america and many of them asked what they can do
1134234 i said from the beginning we are not here to talk about the past we are not here to complain we are not accusing america of anything
1134235 all we are doing is warning you about the future thats why we are here i say
1134236 the nuclear weapon is not just another weapon this will kill us all absolutely and we have to learn to control it and we have to learn to control our violence in general and that is the key message from here
1134237 just like what everybody knows about the kyoto protocol we have the general idea that its good for the environment we want everybody to know that the hiroshima nagasaki protocol shows a commitment to a nuclear free world
1134238 bless me father for i have sinned but do i really have to take my penance in the form of millirem
1134239 its a position thats going to expedite the regulations so we can get more plants up and running

1134264 those giving into laminacks appetite secured job security raises bonuses and promotions
1134265 during and after working hours both on and off the premises and with the actual knowledge of his peers and superiors he used and continues to use his position of power and authority over vulnerable economically dependent and emotionally vulnerable subordinates to seduce or compel as circumstances might warrant intimate sexual relations of a conventional as well as deviate nature
1134266 adopted the expedient practice of enabling laminacks tastes by handsomely compensating injured employees in exchange for their perpetual silence
1134267 unlawful scheme to defraud thousands of fen phen litigation clients
1134268 told her to be quiet and not inform anyone of this
1134269 that allegation makes absolutely no sense because under oquinns contract the oquinn firm pays almost half of the expenses out of his fee so it doesnt really make sense for us to engage in some kind of a scheme to increase the expenses
1134270 our effort the entire time we handled these expenses was to keep them as low as possible
1134271 interesting to say the least because thats one of the primary reasons she was fired
1134272 thats absolutely untrue im saddened that after victimizing her he wants to destroy her reputation im confident the evidence will show who is the victim and who is the wrongdoer
1134273 she was very aggressive at seeking employment with us this is after all these alleged incidents of sexual harassment had occurred
1134274 so that he would be in a better mood and more receptive to testifying in a manner consistent with the litigation theory of defendant law firms
1134275 when all the facts come to light i sure hope the actual facts are reported with the same intensity as the alleged facts contained in the petition
1134276 laminacks trysts are well known and an established part of both firms lore
1134277 no cause of action under or alleging title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 42 u s c 2000e or chapter 21 of the texas labor code is being asserted at this time against any defendant

1134285 what safety message can my readers take away from this
1134286 tainted views were not disclosed until after deliberations were nearly complete the other jurors plainly could have been impacted by her views and thoughts before she disclosed her bias
1134287 as the supreme court has repeatedly explained having preconceived notions even abhorrent ones is very different from being biased in the legal sense relevant here
1134288 congratulations mrs tuszke your test results are positive for pregnancy please hold the line for dr js office hell need to see you in four weeks

1134296 we wish to express our sincere appreciation to the ors office for selecting and supporting our trailblazer as orss first satellite and to the missile defense agency for its role in the development of the initial prototype program which lead to trailblazer
1134297 with the delivery of the trailblazer spacedev has ushered in a new standard for low cost satellites the space business is one of great challenges which are met by people taking great risks while the falcon 1 flight 3 launch was not a success it does not diminish the hard work and efforts of the dedicated teams that combined with the strong government support provided by the ors office enabled us to accomplish the unprecedented in space history accomplishment of delivering a fully functional satellite within six months from ors authorization to proceed our satellite systems represent an excellent value and balance risk cost schedule and performance so we look forward to a long and successful relationship with the ors office the department of defense and spacex

1134313 the fact is that rim met expectations but the issues came from the fact that rim didnt exceed them enough my biggest concern is that 80 of rims revenue is devices because it would suggest that upgrades of mobile devices within organizations are not going to be considered priority budget and that could have a potential impact on rim
1134314 its a balancing act they want a nice chunk of consumer because that will help them if things slow down a bit on the business side but they want to have a nice core base in business because thats where the money is
1134315 the most interesting thing about rim is that it pretty much gets the standard design right and then bangs that design into three or four different handsets that means theyre able to control their costs so theyve got a bit more margins to play with than some of the other players in that sense theyre a bit more recession proof

1134320 there is no way in hell i can swim that far
1134321 oh my god im really doing this im about to complete the swim portion of a triathlon
1134322 i felt very comfortable in the cot car during the test session especially after the second day i also feel much more confident having now gotten a chance to drive the cot car i feel that i can be very successful in this sport and i am looking forward to my future in nascar
1134323 scott ran extremely well testing a variety of set ups over 300 laps
1134324 this was a scheduled test to see how he feels in a cup car and he exceeded our expectations
1134325 scott still has a ways to go well continue to re evaluate the situation but hes given us every indication that hes ready
1134326 we have to win right now and we cant give up opportunities to win races
1134327 thats what was so heartbreaking about last week is to finish so close to winning second everybody pats you on the back and says great run but at this point in our season thats not what were out to do we have a pretty high standard for ourselves and sometimes that causes a little bit of frustration
1134328 that was an awesome car i hate for these guys but i told them to be proud of what we did do
1134329 dont be disappointed about what we didnt do we did some great things today i am proud
1134330 getting behind on the pit stop affected our strategy most we were looking for a way to try and get that back we just had to get it back we got a long green flag at the end we just had to do it all on the race track we didnt get any on pit strategy the way it fell we just had to go battle we finished eighth on two stops when all the cars but one ahead of us made one stop that is pretty awesome that is a lot of speed
1134331 i think that its important to win races and thats the thing that will separate people as we start the chase
1134332 the championship ultimately winds up normally being determined by how well you do when things go bad when you have to say my cars not right weve had a little wreck somethings happened do you go in and self destruct or do you manage to be in a frame of mind where you can go on and get the most out of it matt kenseth and robbie reiser did a great job and matts doing a great job with chip bolin right now they and carl and bob are in the same place with the best of the best and unless youve got that maturity of wisdom and presence and experience gives you that within the organization and having a lot of speed in the car being able to win a lot of races is not gonna do it because when things go bad youre gonna disintegrate
1134333 we dont give up i can promise you that we stick in there and fight even when they tell us were all done
1134334 to come to pocono and finish in the top five is a huge accomplishment for me
1134335 i dont really follow that too closely just for the fact that you go out and race as hard as you can and you want to try to win every week if you cant win do the best that you can and wherever that puts us is what we do so we wouldnt do anything different even if we were counting points

1134337 david byrne wondered if news of his new album with collaborator brian eno would spread on its own via the web uh yeah it will its a david byrne brian eno album for goodness sake anyone who got engrossed in the hypnotic 1981 byrne eno project
1134338 in a nutshell brian wrote most of the music and i composed most of the vocal melodies and lyrics and then sang them
1134339 other musicians play on the album too its not bush of ghosts ii this is a record of sung songs and the result really surprises me despite a sinister inflection to both the lyrics and the music many songs feel fairly uplifting and the overall tone is hopeful from where does this quality derive

1134351 the private equity firms are exploiting the desperation of banks and regulators they know that banks are desperate to raise capital and that doing so is a painful process bankers would rather avoid they also know that regulators and other government officials many of whom where asleep on the job as the financial crisis developed want to avoid the political fallout and economic pain of bank weakness and failure
1134352 if an investment firm owns 25 percent or more of a bank it is considered properly a bank holding company subject to the same federal requirements and responsibilities as a fully regulated bank
1134353 to maximize their profits private equity firms want to own more than 9 9 percent of the banks they have their eye on and they want more managerial control and they want it all without regulation they argue that because they tend to be shorter term investors problems that the rules address are unlikely to occur on their watch
1134354 in one of his most influential essays friedman articulated contemporary capitalisms core tactical nostrum what i have come to understand as
1134355 now when there is great uncertainty about which institutions are too big or too interconnected to fail is exactly the wrong time to allow less transparency and less regulation and with confidence in the financial system badly shaken it would be a mistake to signal to global markets and american citizens that the government is willing to put expediency above long term stability
1134356 if you can borrow money from the u s taxpayer at a moment of crisis that is a very sacred insurance policy underwritten by the u s taxpayer we have the right to oversee anyone who is accessing that insurance policy
1134357 i can tell you that god is alive because i talked to him this morning
1134358 there are plans underway to be here into next week
1134359 i can tell you that god is alive because i talked to him this morning
1134360 only when the last tree has died and the last river been poisoned and the last fish been caught will we realize we cannot eat money
1134361 run your fingers through my soul for once just once feel exactly what i feel believe what i believe perceive as i perceive look experience examine and for once just once understand
1134362 spread love everywhere you go let no one ever come to you without leaving happier
1134363 ill just say whatever you want me to say bets lets just not argue about it
1134364 i dont need a book to know what little boys do
1134365 i look up when i walk so the tears wont fall
1134366 its incredible what passes for heroism these days id like tickertape for pulling out of my driveway and driving around the block three times not like people were shooting at him
1134367 oh take off your dress you get a chance at american airlines you take it end of discussion
1134368 he seemed like a person who was happy to have a job was committed to doing it well and didnt stand out in any way in terms of having anger issues or having any other issues
1134369 we are very thorough in our assessments and there was nothing we could have foreseen
1134370 when do i hear the left handed side of the story
1134371 you wont hear it from me im not worthy of imparting such important information to your delicate shell like ears
1134372 youll hear it from somebody much more important in the overall scheme of things
1134373 youd be surprised what people will say in your presence when they think you cant hear them
1134374 since when are left handed people at war with the dexters
1134375 counter intelligence kidnappings secret elevators to secret headquarters its all a bit over the top isnt it
1134376 weve been at war with the dexters forever or depending on your perspective for approximately negative two hundred years
1134377 so this has something to do with time travel then
1134378 youre very sharp kitty im surprised we didnt recruit you earlier
1134379 but then of course we couldnt because of well the thing
1134380 yeah we had to keep the latest model suits here to deal with the attack
1134381 we see everything we know everything and we adjust the future to work best for us
1134382 and thats why you recruit any left handed person you want
1134383 because whats the point in not joining a group with such unlimited omniprescience
1134384 we like to think we can make a strong case about the exploitation of left handers as well maybe youll get to hear that after this little matter is dealt with
1134385 this is a regular elevator just a lot further down than you might expect
1134386 im messing with you again it just comes out in a different building in la but i had you going didnt i
1134387 well get you out there and then reconvene our discussions with marlee

1134389 inflating tires can save as much oil as we can produce by drilling
1134390 we were extremely pleased with the results of our wimax testing this spring and are ready now for our phase 1 launch within the time frame we committed to earlier this year
1134391 i still love my iphone as much as when i bought it
1134392 the app store is filled with awesome apps available for free or at a cost
1134393 am i going to have to ask each question several times before you give an answer
1134394 in fact ill give you several answers without you even asking the questions if you just follow me
1134395 your thumbs identify you all left handers have a larger thumbnail base on their left hand than they do on their right the dexters dont know that so when they try to infiltrate with a right hander we can spot them straight away
1134396 if they try and infiltrate us with a left hander then the infiltrator immediately flips sides once they hear our story so the dexters cant get to us
1134397 we dont have to spell the obvious stuff out for you do we kit
1134398 the people in the front seat of the car are fine just a little bit of sleep e dart in their necks theyll wake up in a different parking lot across the city
1134399 i cant tell you how the fool who leapt out the window is but im sure hes done stupider things than that in his career and lived i wouldnt worry about him
1134400 relax bonnies not dead she is in fact the complete opposite of dead
1134401 when i said that the left handers who hear our side of the story immediately join us i wasnt kidding once you hear it youll be with us too
1134402 in an ideal world i would have timed that better can you give me thirty seconds and ask that question again
1134403 off to catch a flight to sydney perhaps shoot out from the airport to hyde park for an afternoon siesta or perhaps were off to salzburg for a picnic brunch i hear the hills are alive this time of year
1134404 comes with the whole im a celebrity perhaps youve seen me on the television riding horses who dont want to be ridden thing im afraid
1134405 the ones who spend all their spare time in the future conducting experiments upon clones of your good self
1134406 could i suggest then that we stride purposefully away from them
1134407 rather than the more towards them kind of direction youre currently working with
1134408 im back in town this week so i though i might make an appointment with your healing hands
1134409 im not sure thats the finest idea thats ever sprung forth from your synapses
1134410 these nice people dont want to hurt me especially considering that if you dont hear from me in an hour youre going to contact the other side and rally the troops
1134411 youre not going to gas me for the journey or anything are you
1134412 true multi touch functionality is the future for computing devices
1134413 by providing a platform that offers multi touch gestures we are giving isvs an opportunity to develop new applications many major computer companies have recently announced multi touch technology and our sdk will enable even more advances in what people are able to do with their computing devices
1134414 apple marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
1134415 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously
1134416 although the name says black hat the presenters are far from it the conference really has two types of talks 1 good guys telling good guys what the bad guys already know and 2 good guys telling good guys something that they need to know
1134417 researchers have seen everyone else in k pod except k 7 its safe to say shes gone
1134418 the whale population decline is coincident with the deployment of destroyer squadron 9 to everett in 1995
1134419 the destroyer squadrons exercise area is nominally off the olympic peninsula but has included strait of juan de fuca and haro strait
1134420 these orcas are icons and indicators of the quality of puget sound and coastal waters
1134421 how they fare in coming years will tell us a lot about our own fate
1134422 encouraged more selling in the grains not that any encouragement is needed
1134423 initially steven talked about never doing any concerts or media ever again
1134424 but quickly god began to show steven that if he ever believed the songs he was writing singing and recording before may 21st and marias loss that they must still be true now its the familys hope that these appearances will serve as a chance to proclaim to a watching world what they know and are deeply convinced of even in these difficult days the gospel is true and faith in christ is our hope
1134425 cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight but the truth is the dance goes on
1134426 it does seem that we are on track to beat last years record public transportation ridership
1134427 that can really only be explained by the large increase in gas prices

1134429 the statesmans duty is to bridge the gap between experience and vision
1134430 inflating tires can save as much oil as we can produce by drilling
1134431 as senator mccain knows barack obama has a comprehensive plan to provide real relief to americans struggling with soaring prices and make the long term investments we need to break our addiction to oil
1134432 and while the mccain team may is busy amusing themselves the fact is that the idea theyre attacking is supported by among others top mccain surrogate joe lieberman conference call host mike rogers governors charlie crist and arnold schwarzenegger the department of energy and nascar all of whom have urged americans to help save energy by minding tire pressure
1134433 but hey who ever let the facts or supporters positions get in the way of a political attack aboard the low road express thats no problem at all
1134434 inflating tires can save as much oil as we can produce by drilling
1134435 inflating tires can save as much oil as we can produce by drilling
1134436 so can i assume that those were the battle suited gentlemen to which you referred earlier
1134437 i have a contract for three years and if at the end of this year we dont go up then we will sit down and talk about it again but hopefully we will go up this year and we will all end up where we want to be
1134438 i got my fitness with three weeks at stevenage but when i got there graham westley had already signed half the conference
1134439 my husband has been awesome support to me but its nothing new thats what hes always been
1134440 i really didnt realize how much brokenness there was in my body but she came out of the house after they had mutilated and tried to kill her
1134441 it was just a horrible horrible sight you have no idea and here she is coming out of the house after the attackers left and shes looking for me
1134442 i can hardly wait for the moment when i can meet these guys and were one in christ and we can put our arms around each other and i can assure them of the forgiveness i spoke of here
1134443 i know the process of justice has to be meted out but i also know that with justice there has to be compassion and mercy so people can come out of it on the positive side instead of the destroyed side
1134444 time is very precious to cancer patients and particularly lung cancer patients and we dont want to waste time by giving an inefficient therapy
1134445 this is what we call personalized medicine we know enough about cancer biology to detect specific gene errors in the cancer cells and were also able to design drug therapies that can fix it
1134446 it opened some doors for treatment and the possibility for a cure that i otherwise would not have been entitled to
1134447 we hope with this direction to turn cancer into a disease that you can live with and not die from
1134448 you dont have a leg of a massage table on you by any chance
1134449 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperature and other weather conditions
1134450 from those records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
1134451 i dont have my children here i dont have my mother here i cant keep it clean tonight
1134452 for the word of god is living and active sharper than any double edged sword it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit joints and marrow it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart
1134453 for we also have had the gospel preached to us just as those who have fallen short of it did but the message they heard was of no value to them because those who heard it did not combine it with faith now we who have believed entered that rest
1134454 we are not a one man team he makes us better but we can survive without him but it is a major weapon out of our arsenal well just have to do without
1134455 richter engelhardt muss sich vorwerfen lassen dass er mit seinen urteilen insbesondere mit dem demonstrationsverbot f r antifaschisten die menschenverachtenden machenschaften der neonazis unterst tzt

1134467 will purty shore shut yer car off right away yep
1134468 ha thought i ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah
1134469 as the light looked so dim and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a poverty stricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings
1134470 yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house
1134471 whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses i account it high time to get to sea
1134472 but no more of this blubbering now we are going a whaling and there is plenty of that yet to come
1134473 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
1134474 iran does not recognize the deadline for the nuclear issue we answer to the incentives package whenever it fits us
1134475 backing down one step in the face of the arrogance of the west will encourage it to come one step forward
1134476 the idea that retreating and giving up right stances and words will make the u s change its policy is totally wrong and baseless
1134477 we will see what iran does in two weeks but i think the diplomatic process now has a new kind of energy to it
1134478 if they do not decide to suspend then we will be in a situation where we have to return to the security council
1134479 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
1134480 i didnt count the days the deadline s coming up soon
1134481 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
1134482 we have to make sure we are prepared for every option we dont want war we want peace but we will not let the second holocaust take place
1134483 is there a difference of emphasis it certainly looks as though there is
1134484 the military option although always available it not our preferred route
1134485 we have made that point clear to israel and the world in our public statements and private meetings
1134486 a policy that consists of keeping all options on the table must be maintained
1134487 within just a few months israel will be stronger and more ready in the area of defense against long distance threats
1134488 its very much like a vending machine and i think there are similar types of machines out there in the market
1134489 this alliance with blockbuster is an exciting step for ncr as we pursue our mission of becoming the leader in the market for self service solutions

1134519 im going to meet some people i met on the internet
1134520 imagine a materialistic philosophy that claims that all complex entities including proteins cells organisms ecosystems can be completely explained by the properties of their component parts
1134521 let us imagine though another ontologically materialistic philosophy here complex wholes are inherently greater than the sum of their parts in the sense that the properties of each part are dependent upon the context of the part within the whole in which they operate thus when we try to explain how the whole system behaves we have to talk about the context of the whole and cannot get away talking only about the parts this philosophical stance is variously called wholism holism or organicism
1134522 humpty dumpty has been smashed into billions of fragments can we put humpty dumpty back together again
1134523 so far systems biology is a concept waiting for definition
1134524 the cell can be viewed as an overlay of at least three types of networks which describes protein protein protein dna and protein metabolite interactions
1134525 that systems biology of the living cell has its origin in the expansion of molecular biology to genome wide analyses
1134526 enabling us molecular biologists to view the genome as the system to study
1134527 led to efforts toward genome scale model building to analyze the systems properties of cellular function
1134528 the common property of being composed of interlinked components in which case they might share similarities in detailed structure and control design
1134529 physiology and systems biology share the goal of understanding the integrated function of complex multicomponent biological systems ranging from interacting proteins that carry out specific tasks to whole organisms
1134530 he sees a critical mass type advantage to a diverse group of physiologists and post genomics brand systems biologists working as a group
1134531 argue s that systems biology retreads the conceptual ground covered by post darwinian physiology and resembles nothing more than the application of 19th century physiological reasoning to todays molecular biological data
1134532 he credits systems biologists for their focus on developing mathematical methodologies for the study of complex cellular networks
1134533 hmmm tree snake fan spear wall rope its a single big thing with columnar supports and appendages at the ends
1134534 with the rapidly increasing number of discovered molecular components of mitochondria computational models are also being developed to facilitate the organization and analysis of such data computational models of mitochondria have been accomplished with top down starting with a theoretical model of the system then tested against the data and bottom up starting with the data and building up to the model approaches and have been steadily improved in size and scope results from top down methods tend to be more qualitative but are unbiased by prior knowledge about the system bottom up methods often require the incorporation of a large amount of existing data but provide more rigorous and quantitative information which can be used as hypotheses for subsequent experimental studies
1134535 thus when we try to explain how the whole system behaves we have to talk about its parts the context of the whole and cannot get away talking only about the parts
1134536 the constituent parts and processes of a living thing are related to the organism as a whole by a kind of reciprocal causation
1134537 alternatively one may distinguish between replication transcription translation and metabolism the borders of the various levels in the biological organizational hierarchy are not strictly defined
1134538 imagine a materialistic philosophy that claims that all complex entities including proteins cells organisms ecosystems can be completely explained by the properties of their component parts
1134539 this is the second edition of a textbook currently published by springer for a course in mathematical modeling and computer simulation for biologists at the advanced undergraduate and introductory graduate level
1134540 there are those myself included who believe that high speed computation is to biology and the social sciences what calculus was to physics computer science is the mathematically based or formal tool that seems to map best onto the structure of the questions asked by many modern natural sciences and moves into the domain of the social sciences
1134541 multilevel modeling in systems biology from cells to whole organs
1134542 web sites with tools for modeling and simulating cellular processes
1134543 change is the law of life and those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future

1134557 siperian continues to blaze the trail with a best in class market vision implementation and technology and advanced feature sets
1134558 siperian is best characterised as the smartest kid on the block siperians strength comes from its strong investment in r amp d for leading edge enhancements which brings richness to the solution and market leadership in product strategy and vision

1134563 overall despite challenging worldwide macro economic conditions we are pleased to deliver another solid quarter
1134564 revenues have essentially grown as expected with local currency revpar growth continuing in line with forecasts in the quarter on a same store basis the company held ebitda margins to 30 we continue to execute our long term strategy and have achieved several significant milestones
1134565 looking to the second half of 2008 we expect to see some margin compression
1134566 this pressure is being driven primarily by the impact of inflation including rising worldwide food and fuel prices our client base has traditionally shown resilience throughout economic cycles we must continue to sharply focus our resources on providing them the highest levels of service we are holding fast to our operating philosophies which are key to generating and maintaining customer loyalty in the unique niche in which orient express hotels operates

1134739 well im back yet again a scant few weeks ago i took a look at thermaltakes fairly good prowater 850i kit making just one observation performance could probably see a great improvement if another larger radiator had been added while this concept had in fact been done before on their bigwater 745i it was stunted by mediocre radiators a weaker pump and an older waterblock considering that two of these three factors were corrected in the 850 logic would dictate that throwing the third improvement in would make this kit really shine though its a shame that i dont have the older kits on hand to give a performance review against i feel that this pair of reviews should give users a good idea of the performance they stand to gain provided they have the desire and the space to plumb a second radiator as well as a videocard waterblock into the loop that being said lets crack open the box and see just what a 70 upgrade entails

1134745 anyone with a compact computer case will tell you that finding a good heatsink can be a daunting task after tracking down the best heatsinks available for your budget theres the question of heatsink heights to factor in this is where the new thermaltake duorb heatsink comes in this heatsink features twin 80mm fans set side by side so cooling surface area isnt sacrificed for keeping the total heatsink height under 90mm the duorb is novel in a couple of other aspects

1134750 we have been covering the linux benchmarking scene since 2004 but one area we have never really been satisfied with have been the opengl tests that are available there are now plenty of free software games that are available for benchmarking but with most of them being based around the open source quake 3 engine they arent that demanding upon the graphics processor the ones generally good with stressing the graphics capabilities of the system are the id software games doom 3 quake 4 and enemy territory quake wars with native linux clients under the workstation umbrella there is just specviewperf on the windows side though there are a number of opengl and directx games tech demos and other benchmarks thanks in part to the phoronix test suite however we are starting to see a new era of opengl benchmarking that are able to stress the graphics card and are visually pleasing
1134751 my latest adventure you will read about it soon left me with a few sata hard drives lying around with those drives came a great opportunity to incorporate them into an off site storage solution that being said i absolutely must do this with some style enter the eagle tech consus n series sata to usb enclosure eagle tech has a very industrial feel to their products the presentation starts with their website and transcends into their products hard and soft edges along with some color contrasts bring attention to them aesthetically yet somehow still maintain a simple appearance do they offer features to match the et csnsu2 bk consus series enclosure is garnished with aluminum side panels thumb screws a usb 2 0 would you expect anything less interface provided usb cable a power adapter and an internal sata interface that supports both sata 150 and sata 300
1134752 the tagan icy box has many nice features like the ability to take two small capacity drives and make them look like one larger capacity drive also you can take the drive with you wherever you go unlocking the ability to show people your picture archives or home made movies with ease a backup button allows you to use backup software to save all your irreplaceable data at the touch of a button whether its your work spreadsheets that final paper you have to turn in tomorrow or pictures of your kid taking their first steps
1134753 our good friends at asrock feel your pain building practical solutions for tough problems into motherboards is what they are best known for and they have just released what may be the answer to your problems an intel p45 board capable of running both ddr2 and ddr3 memory this isnt a new idea a few companies did the same thing with the p35 last year most attempts were less than awesome but asrocks board was clearly the best attempt with this experience under their belts asrock has released the p45r2000 wifi will it be the solution for those wanting a gradual crossover from ddr2 to ddr3 keep reading to see
1134754 one of the last cases to make a hit with the enthusiasts was the recent antec nine hundred to give you a little recap it offered front dual blue led 120mm fans along with two internal 120mm fans a unique side window with the optional 120mm cut out behind the black screen 200mm top exhaust fan top mounted front panel ports and looked pretty cool you can still find them on several shelves and makes one heck of a mid tower case after patiently waiting we received word that the antec twelve hundred was finally on the way if you liked the nine hundred and just about bought one youll really appreciate the twelve hundred its one of those cases you might just have to have
1134755 in win is a king of case manufacturers their purview extends across the entire realm of beige from the calm sea of beige to the shallow cliffs of beige with the inoffensive beige plains between i speak in jest i have a soft spot in my heart for the oft marginalized company mainly because they made the first case i ever bought it was you know off white a mini tower affair that came with an adequate psu and even though ive since played with the full spectrum of cases that first case i still have and still use despite the color it was way ahead of its time both in layout and features so i look at the alpha360 boxed up in engrish and i think people should know about these guys these cases are awesome i mean these specific cases the rest are all king beige
1134756 at the 2008 computex event intel officially took the curtains off its 4 series pci express chipset range which is set to replace the original 3 series of chipsets intels 4 series not only brings crossfire support to the mainstream thanks to its ability to run two pci express x8 slots for gpus but it also adds pci express 2 0 to all of its 4 series of chipsets thats right even the low end of the 4 series gets a new pci express controller hub today we have been sent two of the newest members of the 4 series family from asrock and they are loaded with features for the home user along with some nice overclocking for the enthusiast today we take a look at the asrock p45r2000 wifi and the p43r1600twins wifi how do they stack up come and see with us
1134757 aaah storage as far as im concerned you cant have enough of it be it in a server or on the go you cant really ever have too much hard drive space today were taking the time to have a look at a hard drive caddie from a company called vox we will today have a look at how the vox v1 goes up against another caddie we have with us and also against one of our samsung 1tb drives that is already installed in our system before we get into that though lets have a look at the package vox has put together along with a closer look at the caddie itself
1134758 over the past few months we have looked at a few different intel x48 motherboards and all of these motherboards bearing intels latest chipset have worked quite well with linux among these motherboards have been the asus p5e3 premium super micro c2sbx and gigabyte x48t dq6 these x48 motherboards have been expensive but now some of the budget manufacturers are introducing models at a lower cost for just under 200 usd asrock has introduced the x48turbotwins wifi the asrock x48turbotwins wifi pairs intels x48 with the ich9r southbridge and offers a few extra features such as esata integrated 802 11g wifi and ieee 1394 firewire
1134759 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1134760 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1134761 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1134762 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1134763 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1134764 while sitting in my beach chair on the shores of lake coeur dalene
1134765 this little scuba diver swam by unaware she was in the company of a family of ducks headed the same direction i love summer
1134766 id drive a magic carriage and be surrounded by handsome young men
1134767 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1134768 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1134769 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1134770 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1134771 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1134772 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1134773 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1134774 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1134775 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1134776 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1134777 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1134778 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1134779 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1134780 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1134781 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1134782 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1134783 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1134784 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1134785 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1134786 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1134787 porque esto de escribir todo en masculino me pone de los nervios
1134788 desde que instal el mult a matic 2000 en mi ciudad he cambiado 2 veces de bmw y he podido quitar a mi hermano de poner multas de parqu metro para hacerle un despachito
1134789 children and dogs are as necessary to the welfare of the country as wall street and the railroads
1134790 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1134791 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1134792 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1134793 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1134794 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1134795 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1134796 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1134797 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1134798 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1134799 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1134800 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1134801 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1134802 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1134803 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1134804 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1134805 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1134806 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1134807 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1134808 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1134809 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1134810 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

1134819 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1134820 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

1134823 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1134824 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1134825 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1134826 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1134827 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1134828 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1134829 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

1134835 the risks associated with abortion may be more or less similar for the 20th or the 25th week but there are several complications associated with abortion in the second trimester itself 12 to 20 weeks
1134836 the foetus grows bigger as the period of gestation inside the womb increases this may add to additional risks for the mother this includes possibility of a cervical tear as the cervix mouth of the womb isnt ready to dilate at that stage
1134837 the chances of complication increase after that though not significantly but the risk of failure of the abortion procedure is possible at that stage and it may call for a surgical intervention
1134838 congenital complete heart blockage encompasses a spectrum of conditions on on end there is hope that the child will be without any symptoms and lead a normal life
1134839 changes take place in the womb every day hopefully the fetal heart could remain as it is and not worsen further
1134840 if the child has corrected transposition of the great vessels there is a possibility that it could develop a leaky valve at any stage
1134841 do they need a bailable arrest warrant to appear personally and answer the charges
1134842 they do not have the time to file reply just because you are a central minister does not mean you are above law and you would not care about the supreme court order you think you can dictate terms to the supreme court if this is their attitude we will issue bailable arrest warrant against them and let them come and appear before the court
1134843 we are excited to announce the launch of american mcgees grimm our newest episodic title
1134844 working with american and the spicy horse team to bring this game to fans has been a great experience and we know this twisted adventure through classic fairy tales will appeal to a wide audience of game enthusiasts
1134845 the opportunity to work with gametap to develop truly unique content in this new episodic format has been a dream come true
1134846 grimm is a fairy tale adventure that incorporates innovative mainstream play mechanics with classic elements such as platforming power ups easter eggs and more grimm offers something for the cranky dwarf in all of us
1134847 there have been medical advances in caring for premature babies but only a small number born after 24 weeks of gestation can survive
1134848 it has been mentally and emotionally much more traumatic for the mehtas than it has been for me its more for them to decide whether to go in appeal now against the hc judgement
1134849 my role was to create awareness about the lacuna in the rules dealing with cases where the foetus is at a health risk women go through huge amounts of stress and going through the pregnancy takes and life with a very sick child who may never have a normal life to begin with takes a huge toll on them
1134850 demanding her share in the ancestral property will not amount to a dowry demand
1134851 there must be existence of a proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the concerned death if alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has become stale enough not to disturb mental equilibrium of the woman concerned to take extreme step it would be of no consequence

1134867 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
1134868 were all about wireless were not betting on handsets were betting on jobs
1134869 because of technology challenges in the u s the only other carrier the iphone is compatible with is t mobile
1134870 the wireless technology is so radically different that apple would have to come up with an entirely new phone in order to have a product that would work on
1134871 you wouldnt even be getting the full 3g experience with t mobile
1134872 they needed someone high profile with engineering talent and certainly this guy fits the bill
1134873 the only downside is that he doesnt necessarily have any consumer products expertise
1134874 in terms of actual products hitting the street youre not going to see jhas impact before 2010
1134875 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1134876 motorola will only be successful if this new team creates a complete solution that includes hardware software and services similar to apple
1134877 while the iphone is a great phone its real value comes from its software applications and services
1134878 although creating slick phones is one part of the success equation apples success will force even traditional handset makers to think harder about the software and services angle if they are to really compete with apple head on
1134879 theres a tremendous opportunity here to take this business to the next level

1134886 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1134887 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1134888 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1134889 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1134890 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
1134891 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
1134892 they are endowed with a supply of positive charge carrying holes that for years have been the missing ingredients that prevented engineers from building leds from zno nanowires
1134893 zinc oxide nanostructures are incredibly well studied because they are so easy to make now that we have p type zinc oxide nanowires the opportunities for leds and beyond are endless
1134894 p type doping in nanowires would make complementary zno nanowire transistors possible
1134895 this is a fundamental advance in how nanotube circuits are made
1134896 these findings represent the culmination of four years of collaborative efforts between the illinois and purdue groups
1134897 the work established the fundamental scientific knowledge that led to this particular breakthrough and the ability to make circuits
1134898 instead we found a very nice way of essentially removing the effect of these metallic nanotubes without actually eliminating them
1134899 now there is no fundamental reason why we couldnt develop nanonet technologies
1134900 if you can make a flexible circuit with 100 transistors you can make circuits with 10 000 or more transistors
1134901 now electronics are flat which limits their utility since most objects in real life are not flat
1134902 for these types of applications manufacturers might literally print or stamp circuits onto plastic sheets like the roll to roll printing used to print newspapers
1134903 the theory and simulation work done at purdue shows there is always a way to break the metallic path and still keep the semi conducting carbon nanotube path intact
1134904 the teams at illinois and purdue continuously provide insights about why things work the way they do and how to make them work better through combined modeling and experimental efforts
1134905 high performance zno thin film transistor zno tft fabricated by rf magnetron sputtering at room temperature with a bottom gate configuration the zno tft operates in the enhancement mode with a threshold voltage of 19 v a field effect mobility of 28 cm2 vs a gate voltage swing of 1 39 v decade and an on off ratio of 3x105 the zno tft present an average optical transmission including the glass substrate of 80 in the visible part of the spectrum the combination of transparency high field effect mobility and room temperature processing makes the zno tft a very promising low cost optoelectronic device for the next generation of invisible and flexible electronics

1134911 theres no doubt its being done millions and millions of times

1134922 big supermarket chains across the world can range from 100 to a few thousand stores this would mean that we are looking at 1 10 million units of labels that need to be supplied per customer and in these volumes the cost of ownership of rich content esls labels made with our displays rich content esl is a trademark of nemoptic sa can compete successfully with lower priced tn tags the cost competitiveness is due to improved labor productivity more efficient pricing promotional sales management and improved customer loyalty and satisfaction
1134923 automation of this process also leads to better use of human resources across chain stores as wails as price agreement
1134924 price mismatch a direct loss for retailers can be up to 0 5 or more for large stores and if it can be avoided thats a big saving
1134925 colour displays are already available the challenge is to achieve multi colour displays with higher brightness so that market acceptance can become easier

1134977 despite a lengthy and thorough investigation we have been unable to discover exactly what happened to david garden
1134978 in order to bring closure to mr gardens family i would say to anyone with information about the incident who has not already spoken to police that its not too late to come forward
1134979 we thought we would end the series with a light fun romantic comedy that is sure to entertain and delight our audiences
1134980 it has been a hit at festivals around the country and in its over seas release
1134981 ty liebermans script struck me as having the makings of a really fun romantic comedy i immediately loved the premise of the wedding movie with a twist
1134982 the situation in which these characters find themselves was compelling on the verge of marriage our groom must choose between his fianc e and his first love
1134983 i felt there was a delightful paradox in the fact that his first love was a man it is both crucial to the story and yet incidental this could happen to anyone thematically i liked how the screenplay took sexual identity out for a spin
1134984 think my best friends wedding with a sexual twist and you get the picture
1134985 the film is a lot of fun and a lot of laughs and our audience is on the guest list of a very funny wedding
1134986 this is a call to get involved at this critical time in u s history just before an important presidential and congressional election in november 2008 this movie can be a stimulus to dialogue
1134987 wedding as a carefully planned and costumed theater based on traditional but archaic conventions

1134994 were a little apprehensive since the last one was a hoax
1134995 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1134996 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1134997 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief
1134998 making sure that in this transition which will be even more of a transition for the girls that they are settled and that they know they will continue to be the center of our universe
1134999 tack on the fact that there is no sustained mental health support for these families as they are struggling with loved ones who are coming back dealing with emotional issues
1135000 youve got people in pain and we dont hear those voices a lot
1135001 i found it wasnt that barack wasnt interested in helping
1135002 its just that when the baby cried at 4 a m i got up faster than he did because i would hear the baby and i would be up
1135003 being fit has become even more important as ive had children because im also thinking about how im modeling health to my daughters
1135004 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent
1135005 over time the percentage of people who have these conflicts will diminish
1135006 a lot of it will have to do with how much energy the fda is willing to expend to find people who dont have a conflict of interest
1135007 the fda has consistently used a very low standard for granting waivers and there is no evidence that this will change
1135008 by making the standard for waivers more stringent and improving the voting system the fda is moving closer toward ensuring the only interest taken into account during these advisory panels is that of the american people
1135009 simultaneous voting avoids voting momentum in which some voters may be influenced even subconsciously by the votes of those who precede them
1135010 a reinvention of the movie not a revival because there is so much more music and the story is enhanced
1135011 a fundamental lack of knowledge regarding the responsibilities and authority of designated receiving facilities to provide a safe and secure environment for individuals requiring a mental health evaluation
1135012 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1135013 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1135014 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today
1135015 as it cools it crosses thresholds this is one when antarctica became permanently frozen and locked up
1135016 because if human beings are unfortunate enough to push climate over one of these thresholds it could be a total catastrophe
1135017 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss
1135018 ill have a six inch 5 italian bmt on honey oat but hold the pepperoni
1135019 im not substituting anything im removing something i just dont want the pepperoni so leave it off
1135020 i cant im not allowed to make any changes ill get in trouble
1135021 i promise you wont get in trouble your boss will be happy that you charged me for a 3 meat sandwich and only gave me 2 kinds of meat youre saving him money
1135022 how about this when you get to the part where you reach into the pepperoni bin instead of putting it on my sandwich just throw it in the trash will that make you happy
1135023 you do realize how ridiculous that is right youre saying its ok for you to throw perfectly good pepperoni in the trash but its not ok to not throw it away it has to go somewhere please tell me you understand how ridiculous that is
1135024 look im just going by the rules no substitutions were not supposed to change the sandwiches we do have a build your own menu now i could make you a ham sandwich and add the salami but id have to charge you for double meat
1135025 let me get this straight in order to make a bmt but put 1 3 less meat on it you want to charge me a dollar more why dont we run this awesome plan by your manager
1135026 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1135027 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1135028 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1135029 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1135030 this is something i think that has brought this team closer together
1135031 as far as holding the team back i dont feel like it will do so i think its only going to make us better and bring us closer as a team and work toward the ultimate goal of winning the trophy this year
1135032 im not going to get into whos right whos wrong im completely wrong it was an asinine decision
1135033 for me to be a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1135034 trials and tribulations only make you stronger as a man for me and steve im sure he regrets his actions he took but i would be less of a man if i dont forgive him i go to bible study just like he does every week for me to not be able to forgive him im just wasting my time going to bible study
1135035 theres a lot of things that have been brewing for four years now
1135036 i cant possibly tell you what the issues are in this one conversation what has happened in four years the good thing is we were both man enough to come face to face and talk without having any other type of altercations like weve had in the past were bigger than that sometimes when emotions get involved you do stupid things thats what humans do
1135037 were still waiting for the doctors to give us the timetable on when to get the procedure done
1135038 there are a lot of guys in this league that could not have done the things that luc has done for him to show up at fan fest was huge for us i commend him for everything hes done in this whole ordeal were all behind luc 100 percent and were behind steve too hes still one of us

1135080 the shameful trans panic defense is nothing more than a scurrilous attempt to blame the victim for this horrible crime
1135081 the murder of angie zapata just 18 years old is a tragic reminder of the hate and ignorance that threatens the transgender community every day
1135082 even worse is that angies alleged killer is using her gender identity in an attempt to justify his heinous inexcusable actions the shameful trans panic defense is nothing more than a scurrilous attempt to blame the victim for this horrible crime
1135083 the sheer brutality of angies murder the way her killer viewed her as less than human simply because of her gender identity and expression highlights our communitys desperate need for hate crimes protection
1135084 as a transgender woman i am horrified by this crime but as human beings we should all be outraged

1135087 walking past business class where the screens in front of the seats were probably bigger than the tv in my room where the seats fold out into beds where rich five year olds are being tucked into bed by their mothers the air is fresh in the spacious cabin area surrounding the smiling faces content with their wealth and luxury it makes me smile too for a brief moment as i walk towards the divider suddenly i am smacked in the face with the sight of crammed seating the stuffy air the droning sound of chatter and people trying to get organised children screaming the less beautiful the plebs the economy class the peaceful orchestral music that was playing in my head earlier had stopped and the worst thing was yet to come when i realised that this is where i belonged

1135097 the third person involved that will require further investigation by qld health and or the medical board was the former executive director of medical services dr margetts
1135098 it sends a very strong signal to queensland that they now have a very independent strong health watchdog
1135099 i want to see that strengthened even further and thats why ive recommended to the premier that we look at establishing an all party committee to allow the hqcc to operate with independent all party oversight
1135100 what we found was that it took an enormous amount of time for us to find all the information that is separately held in different areas the colleges the medical boards the hospitals put all this together

1135135 the rasmussen reports daily presidential tracking poll for monday shows the race for the white house is tied with barack obama and john mccain each attracting 44 of the vote
1135136 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1135137 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1135138 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1135139 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1135140 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
1135141 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1135142 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
1135143 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
1135144 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
1135145 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
1135146 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
1135147 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
1135148 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery
1135149 mr dennis hunt has done an outstanding job of creating a nationwide awareness in the roadbuilding industry of the importance of energy conservation and good practices in the operation of asphalt plants showing operators how to reduce energy consumption improve the quality of hot mix asphalt for our highways extend the life of the plant equipment and significantly reduce the environmental impact of asphalt plants
1135150 dennis has been addressing plant production and energy conservation issues as well as the introduction of warm mix asphalt with the passion of a true green missionary
1135151 our strong growth in net income was the result of a growing loan portfolio and solid asset quality we are committed to maintaining our asset quality and further leveraging our team to continue increasing our net income
1135152 i am very excited to announce our selection by chrysler as a significant step into the automotive market with our ronincast r for automotive digital signage product

1135157 with the pending merger of our institution with village bank announced in march and currently projected for completion in the fourth quarter of 2008 our board of directors is encouraged by the banks year to date results and excited about our future prospects as a combined entity with village bank we believe the merger will be accretive to future earnings creating a strongly capitalized company operating fifteen branch offices in the greater richmond metropolitan area with total assets under management of approximately 540 million and a staff of approximately 200 employees we believe the merger subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals will create the premiere richmond area based commercial bank given numerous beneficial dynamics of the transaction the merger should give us the ability to compete more aggressively provide greater services to our customers and return an enhanced long term value to our shareholders
1135158 the addition of the as we change brand to blyth will complement our existing direct to consumer portfolio while enhancing our market share within the catalog and internet space
1135159 moreover it fits squarely with our strategy to seek attractively priced acquisitions that can leverage our existing industry expertise and geographic footprint
1135160 i know firsthand that the ship we commission today will be the most capable ship that the coast guard has ever sailed
1135161 hopefully our children will look back on this day of aug 4 2008 and say that under their watch they created a great ship and that ship is going out to defend our way of life guard our borders interdict drugs and make sure our nation is safe
1135162 northrop grummans shipbuilders some 40 000 of them could not be more proud to build and deliver these brand new assets to the coast guard
1135163 bertholf is the flagship of the fleet the largest and most technically advanced class of cutter the coast guard has ever known
1135164 we are in an era of a persistent conflict with hazards and threats to be dealt with
1135165 this ship represents a remarkable step forward not only in capability and capacity but also in the competency of this crew today the crew will bring this ship to life and bertholf will be up to the challenges of the 21st century
1135166 we continue to make strides on successfully navigating through this challenging period for the economy
1135167 this quarter im pleased to report improved profits stable credit quality and a strengthening of the companys overall liquidity with the growth of our new depository marlin business bank
1135168 financial results in the second quarter indicate continued development of the infologix business model we generated meaningful revenue growth on both a year over year and sequential basis expanded our margins and completed the investment in our sales operations and management teams that will allow us to realize operating leverage in the coming quarters we also completed two strategic acquisitions that we anticipate will drive increased margins enhance our intellectual property portfolio and create new sales opportunities at the highest executive levels within our targeted markets we believe our continued progress in the second quarter will add to significant shareholder value as we deliver on our strategic plan
1135169 professional services now represents over a third of our revenues and we see this percentage increasing as we continue to integrate recent acquisitions this progression is in line with our ongoing strategy to develop and acquire higher value higher margin software and service offerings that drive value for customers prospects and shareholders
1135170 we believe the acquisitions and senior financing completed in the second quarter of 2008 are consistent with our strategy to drive our transformation into the leading mobile solutions provider
1135171 we are on plan in integrating our recent acquisitions and expect to realize additional revenue benefits and operating leverage in the second half of 2008 leading to an improved operating margin the continued shift to higher margin mobile solutions and professional and consulting services and expected operating leverage should translate into profitability by the end of 2008
1135172 in light of todays economic conditions we are pleased with our second quarter performance
1135173 we successfully grew both our absolute revenues and our market shares during the quarter while in my opinion continuing to strengthen our brand and market positions
1135174 revenues in fairway woods and drivers increased 29 and 52 respectively for the second quarter of 2008 compared to the comparable period of 2007
1135175 revenues in irons increased 3 for the second quarter of 2008 compared to the comparable period of 2007 we are pleased with our iron sell though and market share performance during the quarter and we believe we strengthened our market positions in this category our idea a3 a3os line of irons ended the second quarter as the 1 brand of irons at off course golf shops with 7 4 share idea remains the 1 selling hybrid iron set brand in golf
1135176 the company introduced the idea pro gold line of hybrids and hybrid iron sets in the second quarter of 2008 these premium products are aimed at skilled players and the idea pro gold hybrids utilize adams boxer technology tm to improve performance for this segment this product line was the follow up to our idea pro line of hybrids and hybrid iron sets the idea pro gold and idea pro line of hybrids have become the most played hybrid on the pga champions and nationwide tours as reflected in year to date performance statistics from the darrell survey we have won the hybrid count in 25 of 33 pga tour events in 2008 including the hybrid counts at all three major championships played to date as well as every hybrid count in every 2008 event on the champions and nationwide tours
1135177 the second quarter was clearly a more satisfying quarter than the first quarter
1135178 market conditions continued to remain challenging in the second quarter but the market share of our idea line of hybrid iron sets and year over year strength in our woods lines drove increased revenue growth in the quarter we remain pleased with our progress in developing our market positions organization and brand looking forward we believe market conditions will likely remain challenging for the balance of 2008 but we believe we have shown that we can continue to make progress towards our growth and brand goals despite tough conditions looking further forward we remain firmly optimistic regarding our long term prospects for growth and creation of shareholder value

1135191 july was the worst month of 2008 this year both the stock exchange and investment funds will suffer i think the level of losses will diminish by the end of the year but they will not be recovered
1135192 the evolution of stock exchange quotes does not match the financial results of the listed companies the market is volatile and far too sensitive to international turmoil
1135193 however the funds investment portfolio is based on analyses and calculations so we did not modify our strategy when the stock exchange was going down
1135194 premios performance is due on the one hand to its conservative equity portfolio and to the fact that it lowered its exposure to the stock exchange to 65 70 of the funds assets and on the other hand to the registration of dividends and bonus shares in the funds assets which amid a low volume of assets contributed to the yield

1135204 nu ma ajuta cu nimic o dublare a portofoliului daca pe 30 din el am probleme de recuperare vanzarile trebuie stimulate pe partea de calitate chiar daca pierd din cota ca expunere vreau sa castig prin calitatea acesteia
1135205 nu inseamna ca nu am facut si erori pentru ca anticiparea unui viitor nesigur si a riscurilor care pot fi asumate nu este tot timpul corecta am observat pe unele piete deteriorari ale portofoliilor de credite de consum negarantate

1135213 aveam foarte multe produse din game diferite cu etichete diferite care intr o proportie de 80 aveau aceeasi adresabilitate prima data am constientizat acest lucru pe segmentul vinurilor premium ne am dat seama ca avem 17 etichete ceea ce era un foarte mare dezavantaj pentru ca in unele restaurante din bucuresti aveam o parte din etichete in altele o alta parte practic nu era un efort concentrat astel incat consumatorul sa se intalneasca cu acelasi produs in toate punctele de vanzare cu acelasi nivel de servicii
1135214 in momentul in care faci vinuri doar din plantatia ta si nu folosesti alte mijloace exista problema unor rupturi de stoc pe care nu o poti rezolva pentru ca nu ai materia prima necesara iar riscul este cu atat mai mare cu cat productia este rupta in 17 coduri in cazul reducerii portofoliului stocurile sunt mai mari deci ai continuitate mai buna

1135333 this was really her first time playing outside of whitehorse and it was full court tennis which she hasnt played very much of
1135334 the ricks rookie tour division there is a whole series of them across the lower main land through the summer they get a lot of people so she really got to play just a lot of different players in the course of those two days which was great
1135335 we were really unsure of how he would do and to get the quarter finals in the singles and then the finals in the doubles was really beyond what we had expected
1135336 we would like to send at least a couple of players that would be really exciting for us
1135337 we could take a team of eight and im not sure we will have eight players but we may have four two boys two girls would be best case scenario
1135338 the whole event went really well we are very happy
1135339 the focus in this event is still participation and everybodys a winner who actually comes out and enjoys the day
1135340 i dont do a lot of trail races so it was kind of fun to do something different from the road and there is so many great trails out here
1135341 it just makes sense to run a trail race in the yukon
1135342 lie in bed and think about what might have been
1135343 after the faro mine closed we saw the population tail off
1135344 and i believe it was 2003 our population started to increase again and its been a pretty steady rise over the last few years
1135345 the department of economic development was expecting more than 33 000 by years and were already there
1135346 and the majority of those new residents are in whitehorse
1135347 if somebody hasnt used their card in a year theyre sent out a mailer to see if theyre still living here so its a fairly current file
1135348 i just wanted to see what things were looking like now compared to back then
1135349 its more of a positive than a negative up here
1135350 guvernul va trimite materiale in 2 3 saptamani sa va refaceti casele

1135352 i am very proud and pleased to be a part of this team
1135353 it is always special when we are able to combine our players and represent the north i know these young women i have are quality individuals and they have been working very hard they will be great representatives for our northern territories on the national stage
1135354 i think it almost helps because we are all coming with different skills from different places and we are making friends for our whole life so it helps a lot
1135355 i think it is even better because the only thing we can do is gain
1135356 we have nothing to lose and we are going to go there and thats what we are going to do we are going to gain
1135357 i dont think we were as well prepared for it as we will be this year and we didnt set high enough standards for ourselves so we didnt do as well as we will do this year
1135358 if you come from a small town and city and you are playing in just high school tournaments its not the same level at all
1135359 when you go down to nationals you know that you will never face that kind of competition anywhere else so its really good to know whats out there

1135379 the global poverty act of 2007 s 2433 is coming up for a senate vote according the office of senator kay bailey hutchison once harry reid and the democrat leadership put it on the calendar we could have as little as a week to prepare for the vote
1135380 rumors have been circulating around capitol hill that a few activist groups have renewed their surge and have begun lobbying full force for a bill introduced by presidential candidate sen barack obama d il the bill has already passed out of the senate foreign relations committee without any public hearings and it also passed the house earlier this year it is important to note that both of these votes were voice votes which was a deliberate strategy of the congressional majority so that no record would be kept of those who voted in favor of this problematic bill
1135381 while senator barack obama struggles to keep the public in the dark about the nature of his pro u n global poverty act a recent bay area interfaith leaders luncheon was held to lobby for senate passage of the bill whose cost has been estimated at 845 billion
1135382 meanwhile a concerned parent alerted us to the fact that a christian preschool in long island new york was handing out a coloring page for children which included a plea for congress to pass obamas global poverty act
1135383 the enclosed sheet said dear senator at preschool i learned to thank god for the food i eat
1135384 the pictures to be colored included what appeared to be an angel holding a bowl of food with a valentine heart on the robe and the bowl and a basket with apples
1135385 this amounts to a tax of over 2 000 on each man woman and child in the united states the foreign aid budget now stands at 300 billion the act would add the additional expenditure to the already huge amount allocated to assist the world
1135386 through a global tax preferably on carbon emitting fossil fuels
1135387 we will need in the end to put real resources in support of our hopes a global tax on carbon emitting fossil fuels might be the way to begin
1135388 it began as a united nations humanitarian aid program called oil for food but it ended up with saddam hussein pocketing billions to become the biggest graft generating machine ever and enriching some of americas most forceful opponents at the united nations
1135389 i believe the u n parts of it have been corrupt for years but this went to a whole new level
1135390 tax on the rental value of land and natural resources
1135391 fees for the commercial use of the oceans fees for airplane use of the skies fees for the use of the electromagnetic spectrum and a tax on the carbon content of fuels
1135392 i knew it was going over but i tell you its worth every cent of it
1135393 maybe not right now maybe not right this minute but in the long run
1135394 the suspect was only in the store for a matter of seconds maybe a minute but not very long at all
1135395 we dont know exactly how long it was that the clerk was in there before the customer found him
1135396 i didnt think you still had enough energy left to slow time itself down after all the other spells you used earlier in this fight all with the sole purpose of killing me so you can go after the emperor then again it would seem i underestimated you i should have expected something like that from exanimus the fallen high inquisi no wait former high inquisitor of the empire
1135397 whats wrong dont you like it when i say former high inquisitor i do believe this is treason therefore you are no longer a erk
1135398 silence thanatos the reaper high inquisitor and ass kisser of the emperor himself i wish you could have joined me but you have to stay loyal to that bastard when you know what he is doing is far from right
1135399 the emperor is all we have and we took oaths to obey until we die in combat which isnt very likely monstrosities like us we are immortal almost impossible to kill we have power that even rivals the emperor himself and he is a god
1135400 almost sounds like you intend to take over overthrow and kill him when his guard is down a sneaky trick for someone who is as proud and as valiant as you try to sound
1135401 never i took that oath and i intend to keep it i am fine with being his right hand
1135402 my you are getting really pissed arent you no wonder you havent noticed that it is taking way to long for you to heal you havent even noticed that my blade is enchanted to slow down regenerative abilities
1135403 you might defeat me here brother but what good will it do how about the fight in my citadel
1135404 my trump card in dealing with you it has a forbidden enchantment that destroys the flesh it hits however it seems the self healing abilities we possess cancel it out enough to keep the gangrene from setting in which spreads and consumes a normal person within moments of even being pricked i see it instead keeps your healing busy enough that it cant close the wound i think it works rather nicely still
1135405 i thought it was that enchantment it took the sacrifice of about 100 imperial high priests to bestow something like that plague one of the four horsemen upon that blade
1135406 well now i never thought youd be the cowardly type and attack a practically unarmed opponent from behind
1135407 damn do you know how much it will cost to repair my citadel you did a thorough job of redecorating it unfortunately it isnt one bit to my liking perhaps if i were to add your weapons as well as your head to my collection to help adorn the walls
1135408 im sorry am i supposed to give a shit about your citadel
1135409 i will slay you i will save my friends up above and i will slay that demon you and the entire empire worships like a god
1135410 you saw and heard everything i did why do you insist on staying loyal to that bastard and his cause
1135411 why cant you just join me and we can end this foolishness i made an oath and i will die before i break it i still believe in the utopia he says he will make ill continue to bathe in blood if that is what it will take to get there
1135412 but you are either enslaving or exterminating any race of beings you come across i admit that i too thought i wanted to build a utopia but that is impossible to do it that way besides we are just tools to the emperor and goddamn monsters to everyone else we have no real place at least not once he is done using us and he has us all wiped out
1135413 im sorry ex ya know you are like a brother to me but i cant make you see reason and you also know traitors must die
1135414 you cant thats the macht stein from orpheus youd use it like this for treason this is madness
1135415 madness this is the best way to end this here and now with this spell and the power the macht stein grants me i can take you and half the imperial armada out as well as destroying all your own personal soldiers on this planet all i have to do to finish the summoning is to pour almost all of my life force into the macht stein then finish the spell it should be one hell of a fireworks show
1135416 but it took all the lives of an entire race and the life of the races planet itself to create that thing
1135417 they are already dead i cant do much for them except to give them peace by helping them to get even
1135418 if giving my life is enough to save hers it is more than a fair trade you should know thats how i see it by now

1135423 since speaker pelosi has decided not to keep the house in session to allow this vote to take place we urge you to use the power vested in you by the constitution to convene an immediate energy special session of congress
1135424 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote

1135441 liz may be the toughest most tenacious player ive ever seen having come back from eight knee surgeries and played through knee injuries that would put any normal human on a stretcher
1135442 no woman should have to do that in the middle of winter
1135443 its risky is it going to take someone losing their life or the life of their baby before they do something about it its not going to be my baby and hopefully it wont be anyone elses
1135444 our first response in travel is for the woman to be given the option of getting to christchurch by their own methods usually driving and if that is not possible to investigate other ways of transporting her
1135445 my contractions were five to 10 minutes apart there is no way i could drive myself

1135450 it would be disingenuous to suggest that these incumbents are working to seriously address the challenges we have with sexual predators particularly in view of their legislative record on the other hand when tom depoy and i served in the legislature we led the fight to strengthen the penalties for sex offenders and other violent criminals
1135451 press releases arent a substitute for action and wont keep our children safe we need legislators who will work proactively to keep these dangerous criminals where they belong in prison
1135452 if the legislature had the courage to keep these predators off our streets in the first place the board of aldermen wouldnt be forced into this position the fact is that with the exception of a proposal to ban roller skating after dark rutland citys incumbent legislators have done absolutely nothing to make our streets safer for children
1135453 while tom depoy and i voted to strengthen sex offender penalties in 2006 it was one of these very incumbents who chose to vote against a proposal to keep sexual predators off our streets

1135466 si in cehia se poate observa un comportament diferit al utilizatorilor finali acestia se asteapta la un raport foarte echilibrat intre functionalitati si pret iar design ul cu siguranta nu este o prioritate
1135467 din punct de vedere numeric romania este a doua piata din regiune insa cel mai important aspect este faptul ca utilizatorii sunt dispusi sa plateasca mai mult atat pentru design cat si pentru functionalitati
1135468 facem in mod constant teste de evaluare a rezistentei portofoliului pentru a vedea cum poate fi absorbit un soc valutar la nivelul clientului sa i intelegem gradele de senzitivitate si robustetea la un curs de 4 2 lei euro atat de vehiculat de unii analisti la inceputul anului bcr ar inregistra o usoara deterioare a portofoliului dar ar ramane profitabila

1135471 managerul de risc poate juca roluri diferite pot fi doctor nu si sa nu accept decat credit acoperite 100 cu garantii sau pot sa am abordare se sustinere a vanzarilor in mod selectiv daca ai un management al riscului slab nu mai poti practica preturi diferentiate de la un client la altul in functie de profil ramai cu preturi mai ridicate pentru toti si din aceasta cauza in cele din urma pierzi clientii buni si ramai cu cei cu probleme
1135472 nu ma ajuta cu nimic o dublare a portofoliului daca pe 30 din el am probleme de recuperare vanzarile trebuie stimulate pe partea de calitate chiar daca pierd din cota ca expunere vreau sa castig prin calitatea acesteia
1135473 nu inseamna ca nu am facut si erori pentru ca anticiparea unui viitor nesigur si a riscurilor care pot fi asumate nu este tot timpul corecta am observat pe unele piete deteriorari ale portofoliilor de credite de consum negarantate
1135474 acum vedem cat de tare loveste absenta unor standarde prudente
1135475 nu cred ca exista un bubble pe zona comerciala a fost o supraincalzire dar au urmat si corectii in ultima vreme cat timp exista un dezechilibru atat de mare intre cerere si oferta ar trebui sa ne putem recupera creantele cel putin la valoarea nominala a garantiilor urmarim totusi cu atentie diferentele de preturi dintre bucuresti si provincie si folosim propriii evaluatori de imobile este foarte important sa mentii obiectivitatea in evaluare
1135476 este foarte bine acoperit cu garantii avand in vedere in mod traditional la bcr se punea accentul pe colateral totusi structura finantarilor trebuie schimbata in termeni de ajustare a bilanturilor clientilor

1135526 the american people are hurting from the high price of gasoline and i commend minority leader john boehner minority whip roy blunt and all the republicans in congress who took to the house floor last week to fight for a vote on an energy bill that includes more domestic supply
1135527 it was simply wrong for congress to take a five week paid vacation without ever taking a vote on giving the american people more access to american oil
1135528 i look forward to joining our leaders and my fellow republicans returning to congress this week

1135576 its doing it the same way that the original fallout games did it and giving you an ending that is customised to the way that you played the game and at certain points in the game taking into account whatever you did and incorporating that into your ending so that what youre getting is tailored for your experience as opposed to the generic heres how it ends with no real accounting of how you played the game with the kind of things you did at various points
1135577 the number of variations is over 500 but thats of all the different permutations you can have of each different variable and what you did at each point it takes into account any number of things youve done from early in the game to right up when the game ends it takes into account all of that stuff
1135578 were really not talking about the main quest at all until the game comes out so i dont want to say anything that reveals how that works

1135590 they never gave her any of the proper medications for her aids diagnosis they did give her a prescription for a urinary tract infection but even then they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end

1135602 some businesses require scale to survive but scaling is driven by investors as there is minimum absolute revenue required to make a company attractive enough to say list on a stock exchange all decisions on the benefits of scaling never consider the impact it has on the entrepreneurs time and mindshare
1135603 if i spend say 20 hours a week chasing my dream and it generates results of rs x how can i generate rs 2x by investing just 10 hours and freeing up 10 hours by forcing yourself to be efficient and attaching a value to your time you come up with much smarter ways of growing your business within the lifestyle parameters you have defined

1135615 after the recent fires the spotted owls and old growth trees will always be near to our hearts because now little pieces of them are lodged in our lungs losing habitat to wildfires is very dangerous to all species its just wrong because it could have been prevented
1135616 its great news for all of the communities in the sierra nevada people have worked so hard for so long and this decision has definitely lifted all of our spirits we have the people and the talents to make the sierra nevada forests safer and more sustainable and this decision certainly will help us do that
1135617 this ruling will go a long way toward allowing the u s forest service to return to its role as manager of public land in the sierra nevada and will enable the hfqlg program to provide a wildlife friendly way to protect people and the forest

1135648 in amerika zijn ze ongelooflijk ambitieus en werken ze enorm effici nt toen we er waren hoorden we bijvoorbeeld dat er een plan is om het aantal daklozen in vijf jaar met tweederde te verminderen of ze aan onderdak en een baan worden geholpen is een tweede maar durf zon plan in nederland maar eens uit te spreken
1135649 er heerst daar veel meer een cultuur van niet lullen maar gewoon doen dat geldt ook voor langdurige grote projecten hier moet het vaak vooraf worden dichtgetimmerd zodat alle risicos worden uitgesloten daar is het veel normaler om te leren van zaken die gaandeweg minder goed gaan iedereen mag fouten maken
1135650 we wilden er inspiratie opdoen voor de langdurige zorg een sector die al een tijdje volop in ontwikkeling is vroeger zetten we pati nten in ziekenhuizen zodat iedereen er zo min mogelijk last van had nu zijn we op zoek naar andere manieren van behandeling daarom wilden we eens ergens anders kijken
1135651 dat is een organisatie die oude vervallen hotels heeft gerenoveerd en waar nu soms 400 500 mensen wonen de helft is psychiatrisch pati nt of zorgbehoevend de andere helft niet dat zijn vaak mensen met een laag inkomen alles leeft er dus door elkaar heen en een paar portiers zorgen voor de veiligheid
1135652 alle mogelijkheden voor activiteiten of andere vormen van begeleiding zijn daar aanwezig maar er wordt niets opgelegd de nadruk ligt op wonen en werken
1135653 natuurlijk kan het bijna niet amerikaanser die nadruk op werk werk werk hier wordt veel meer rekening gehouden met de kwetsbaarheid van de mensen maar daar werkt het wel
1135654 het geeft hoop je hoort erbij mensen krijgen hun trots terug
1135655 new york is er ook wel een stad voor je moet je daar gewoonweg aanpassen aan de standaard de cultuur is daar veel meer gebaseerd op verantwoordelijkheid nemen
1135656 je moet ook niet alles over willen nemen er zijn bepaalde dingen die we in stand moeten houden maar
1135657 de ambitie is er je hebt het gevoel dat we met deze ervaringen iets kunnen en je praat er met allerlei mensen over bovendien gebeurt er al ontzettend veel we zijn een bepaalde richting ingeslagen en willen verder
1135658 het leven buiten de instellingsmuren moet voor cli nten veel aantrekkelijker worden gemaakt
1135659 thuis toch maar iemand met psychische problemen halen we juist daar weg terwijl je voor een goede behandeling juist een omgeving moet hebben waarin cli nten zich veilig voelen je moet ze eigenlijk zo lang mogelijk in die vertrouwde omgeving behandelen die stap willen we gaan zetten

1135783 but we have been buoyed and heartened by the american people and what they have said is thank you for leading

1135812 this merger is a bold move to effectively and efficiently serve those families in need of affordable housing
1135813 my feeling has always been when a consumer purchases a scotty cameron putter he or she is making an investment in the future of their game my name is on it and the titleist script is on it meaning it has to be made to exacting standards and contribute to improved performance for the golfer these initiatives address that philosophy
1135814 i think most golfers have a special relationship with their putters golfers talk to their putters sometimes it is punished by getting placed in a closet the garage or the trunk of a car most often golfers always go back to that special one that special relationship to me and a lot of other people putters are heirlooms they are passed down from generation to generation the goal of the putter studio has always been to make the best product while providing outstanding service the ability to refinish and restore putters is an extension of that service

1135818 hell be surfing next weekend i cant wait to get him out there
1135819 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
1135820 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
1135821 these groups have said we cant survive four more years of this
1135822 it is something that really gets people out in the streets
1135823 its not directed specifically against the republicans thats for certain
1135824 its against the warmakers but even people marching dont necessarily have to see things as broadly as i do
1135825 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
1135826 we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
1135827 some obama backers are right to worry the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
1135828 these types of campaigns which the media often helps todrive as it analyses the effectiveness of the attacks before questioning the accuracy of theinformation will continue from now until election day on november 4
1135829 and its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
1135830 there is some evidence that the balance of enthusiasm has shifted and that young people who seemed to turn out and vote for senator obama in unusually high numbers in the primaries and caucuses are no longer so enthusiastic about him
1135831 i think they are cynical and want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1135832 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia

1135838 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
1135839 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
1135840 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
1135841 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1135842 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well

1135860 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
1135861 were all about wireless were not betting on handsets were betting on jobs
1135862 because of technology challenges in the u s the only other carrier the iphone is compatible with is t mobile
1135863 the wireless technology is so radically different that apple would have to come up with an entirely new phone in order to have a product that would work on

1135880 there are pretty things to look at which encourage people to want to walk because you feel invited
1135881 it kind of sets up this defensive feeling in a neighborhood
1135882 well work to get the division of water to do something about either covering or removing this
1135883 the walking maps are a great example of a very fun way to get people moving
1135884 i think that its a good idea because i know that in this neighborhood a whole lot of people walk

1135891 coach has the belief in me since sizzle isnt here that ive got the right to go in there with the first team and show what i can do
1135892 all i do is go in there and know the plays and get into my playbook more i think ive matured to the point where i know my plays and everything
1135893 its just one of those things where you can never really predict a guys timeline for getting it and hes shown i know its early signs that he has a much better understanding of the game especially at the nfl level
1135894 i think hes poised for a potential breakout season if things fall the right way
1135895 he came in this morning i think he had a 5 30 flight coming out of south florida and he was dressing for practice well we had to give him a physical first
1135896 thats part of the process and hes got a couple things to do but hell be out there this afternoon hes excited and ready to go

1135914 victory is achieved when there is a stable iraq capable of defending governing and sustaining itself and that will be our ally in the larger war
1135915 did extensive work and research on this very tomb and its ossuaries
1135916 im not a christian im not a believer i dont have a dog in this fight
1135917 i just think its a shame the way this story is being hyped and manipulated
1135918 ive know about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists and none of us thought it was much of a story because these are rather common jewish names from that period
1135919 its a publicity stunt and it will make these guys very rich and it will
1135920 have set it up as if its a legitimate academic debate when the vast majority of scholars who specialize in archaeology of this period have flatly rejected this
1135921 if jesus family had been wealthy enough to afford a rock cut tomb it would have been in nazareth not jerusalem

1136122 i saw paula suffer from lethargy confusion a degree of denial and profound sadness almost like grief
1136123 my first and only priority in these circumstances is paulas health and wellbeing and that of her family
1136124 i would expect that ms wriedt will be given the time and every other support that she needs in order to recover

1136163 but this time around i have figured out a foolproof scheme for making the hours fly by
1136164 i have this great screenplay for you to read and the travel agent has just confirmed that we can sit together for the whole flight it will be great
1136165 mediasilo was born from a production environment so our workflow is custom tailored to casting workflows
1136166 wipeout is a good example of how the mediasilo online tool suite can cut costs and dramatically increase productivity in the demanding and time sensitive network or syndication production environment
1136167 i should run the other way but im not so lets see again
1136168 he got up from the table to look for some business cards and did not come back
1136169 the restaurant informed us of what happened and we later heard through interpol that he was a missing person
1136170 if youre writing a book you dont leave that behind
1136171 time and time alone waits for no man and dang few women
1136172 success has always been easy to measure it is the distance between ones origins and ones final achievement
1136173 i will act now i will act now i will act now henceforth i will repeat these words each hour each day everyday until the words become as much a habit as my breathing and the action which follows becomes as instinctive as the blinking of my eyelids with these words i can condition my mind to perform every action necessary for my success i will act now i will repeat these words again and again and again i will walk where failures fear to walk i will work when failures seek rest i will act now for now is all i have tomorrow is the day reserved for the labor of the lazy i am not lazy tomorrow is the day when the failure will succeed i am not a failure i will act now success will not wait if i delay success will become wed to another and lost to me forever this is the time this is the place i am the person
1136174 i dare to say that vivienne is proving to resemble angelina in spirit attitude and physicality she is quite elegant like her mother and knox hes a bit of me he likes music like his dad
1136175 but when he was born he looked like vladimir putin
1136176 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time shiloh calls the twins her babies she and zahara pick out their clothes help change and hold them its sweet they are like little mommies
1136177 brad and the kids came a few nights each week and spent the night
1136178 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1136179 ive finally decided to get professional help its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1136180 ive really had a lot on my mind really been contemplating a lot of things
1136181 in america we celebrate the virtues of the quiet hero the one who does his duty without complaint or expectation of praise the one who listens closely for the call of his country and when she calls he answers without reservation not for fame or reward but for love
1136182 but our purpose is not only to give tribute though a fitting tribute it is
1136183 tonight we ask bubble boy to answer his countrys call not for his sake but for ours not for his glory but for the dreams we dream for our children and for the dreams they will dream for theirs
1136184 we nominate bubble boy for president because he is a cartoon of honor a cartoon of firm purpose and deep commitment to his countrys cause
1136185 could not use the clone stamp tool because of a program error
1136186 i took this photo at the viera wetlands in florida early in the morning i mounted my nikon d200 on a tripod and used a 500mm lens and a 1 4x teleconverter
1136187 i pass by this spot almost every day most people hate dandelions and call them weeds but i love them i feel that they are miniature reflections of the sun
1136188 mesothelioma is a form of cancer that is almost always caused by previous exposure to asbestos
1136189 they have given a lot of service to the department they are well recognized in the region nationally and internationally
1136190 we chose them because of their dedication to the program and their ability
1136191 hard edge style with an emphasis on limited color fields
1136192 i believe that art is made from the materials of our own life not because those materials are the most expedient but because these are the things to which a person gives meaning
1136193 my preference was screen printing but because of my health i had to stop
1136194 my back went out about 10 years ago and pulling a squeegee across a screen isnt conducive to physical health now i do digital photography
1136195 i am your servant you have the right to dismiss me when you please what you have no right to do is ask me to bear responsibility without the power of action
1136196 the no complaining rule positive ways to deal with negativity at work
1136197 its out of my control right now the doctor thinks the rehab is working but its wait and see until next week thats about the best answer i have
1136198 when you play at the highest level things physically can go wrong
1136199 i am optimistic but this is my shoulder and that makes this serious
1136200 we are of course approaching all friendly countries but we do hope that the nsg will similarly grant a clean unconditional exemption for india
1136201 the deal is certainly important for india but its also important for the world at large because i think it meets the twin objectives of energy security as well as global climate change related issues and concerns
1136202 the latter will be almost the sole problem in the coming nsg debate
1136203 sceptics including smaller european and developing nations canada new zealand and disarmament groups fear it will fray loyalty to an npt already challenged by a push for nuclear power led by iran in the volatile middle east
1136204 if australia had opposed india at the iaea or at the nsg where because we have the worlds largest reserves of uranium we are a significant voice it would have been a savage blow to the australia india relationship
1136205 the film doesnt have such a family it just consists of a father and a daughter the family seems incomplete and thus imperfect and the girl a little spoiled yet i think it captures the way we experience our family relations for most if not all of us
1136206 there was a particular blogger who mentioned that because the majority of the population has a complete family unit they may not be able to relate to the video to which yasmin humorously replied
1136207 while i was chatting with some of the another attendees she came in and we got introduced i was told later that i squealed when she was introduced to us i got to shake her hand omg i even got to take peekchers with her i think i might have even hyperventilated
1136208 the standard style of tv commercials promotes government campaigns in a traditional and mostly predictable way the new family tvc hopes to leave a deep impression on viewers with its engaging and emotive storyline instead of painting a rosy picture of a perfect family this tvc seeks to touch the viewers deep inside
1136209 believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact
1136210 the longer i live the more i realize the impact of attitude on life attitude to me is more important than facts it is more important than the past than education than money than circumstances than failures than successes than what other people think or say or do it is more important than appearance giftedness or skill it will make or break a company a church a home the remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day we cannot change our past we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way we cannot change the inevitable the only thing we can do is play on the one string we have and that is our attitude i am convinced that life is 10 what happens to me and 90 how i react to it and so it is with you we are in charge of our attitudes
1136211 personality can open doors but only character can keep them open
1136212 the best job goes to the person who can get the job done without coming up with excuses or passing the buck
1136213 if you have integrity nothing else matters if you dont have integrity nothing else matters
1136214 if i had asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses
1136215 a fundamental lack of knowledge regarding the responsibilities and authority of designated receiving facilities to provide a safe and secure environment for individuals requiring a mental health evaluation
1136216 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1136217 it becomes its not just our union it becomes a political message theyre trying to get out
1136218 if i had my preference i wouldnt bring politics into it but we just cant lose the moment and the opportunity when so many friends and family are together
1136219 but we have to do double duty theres no other choice
1136220 i couldnt bear the thought of getting more things to dust in our home
1136221 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1136222 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples
1136223 and so far none of our blood relatives or straight friends have actually contributed any money
1136224 we dont need another toaster or another set of silverware
1136225 so we thought wed have people who want to celebrate with a gift do that with these two institutions
1136226 the very fact that we can get married to some people is a political act
1136227 if i had asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses
1136228 it reflects the objectives that we want to be met which is that new zealanders get to keep more of their own money while facing the right incentives
1136229 it has and will be funded by national making clear choices and having a clear sense of priorities
1136230 free presentations in powerpoint format and free interactive activities for kids
1136231 we always support the state governments by providing them the digital learning resource dlr for deployment in government schools
1136232 a note of caution our digital learning resource are not meant to help in computer literacy the target group is children in the age group of 6 14 years and the digital learning resource primarily presents concepts related to maths science and language related to the curriculum for classes standard i to standard viii
1136233 und denkt dran jungs das motto bleibt arbeit macht frei
1136234 just invite who you want if people dont understand theyre not really your friends
1136235 i dont like it when people dont come back to visit but then expect me to come to their wedding when they come back for that
1136236 i dont know ive never done 300 at a time
1136237 can you do 300 in sets of 10 i have a class project in mind and i need you to do about 300 push ups in sets of ten for this to work can you do it i need you to tell me you can do it
1136238 well i think i can yeah i can do it
1136239 good i need you to do this on friday let me explain what i have in mind
1136240 cynthia do you want to have one of these donuts
1136241 steve would you do ten push ups so that cynthia can have a donut
1136242 steve would you do ten push ups so joe can have a donut
1136243 steve would you do ten pushups so scott can have a donut he doesnt want
1136244 look this is my classroom my class my desks and these are my donuts just leave it on the desk if you dont want it
1136245 steve would you do ten more pushups so jenny can have a donut that she doesnt want
1136246 do i have to make my nose touch on each one
1136247 well theyre your pushups you are in charge now you can do them any way that you want
1136248 you realize that if jason comes in you will have to do ten pushups for him
1136249 okay steve ill let you get jasons out of the way right now jason do you want a donut
1136250 steve will you do ten pushups so that jason can have a donut
1136251 steve would you do ten pushups so that linda can have a donut she doesnt want
1136252 no steve has to do it alone i have given him this task and he is in charge of seeing that everyone has an opportunity for a donut whether they want it or not when i decided to have a party this last day of class i looked at my grade book steve here is the only student with a perfect grade everyone else has failed a test skipped class or offered me inferior work steve told me that in football practice when a player messes up he must do push ups i told steve that none of you could come to my party unless he paid the price by doing your push ups he and i made a deal for your sakes steve would you do ten pushups so susan can have a donut
1136253 and so it was that our savior jesus christ on the cross pleaded to the father into thy hands i commend my spirit with the understanding that he had done everything that was required of him he yielded up his life and like some of those in this room many of us leave the gift on the desk uneaten
1136254 we will always tend to fulfill our own expectation of ourselves
1136255 a prediction that in being made actually causes itself to become true
1136256 the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves but how shes treated i shall always be a flower girl to professor higgins because he always treated me as a flower girl and always will but i know i can be a lady to you because you always treat me as a lady and always will
1136257 you have to expect things of yourself before you can do them
1136258 believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact
1136259 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god
1136260 before and immediately after 8 august we will not see persistent heavy rainfall
1136261 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
1136262 we are not supporting some things the current government is and we are supporting a bigger tax cut programme
1136263 its quite simple if were borrowing and if were reckless theyre borrowing and theyre reckless were borrowing for infrastructure were not borrowing for tax cuts
1136264 its about addressing the infrastructure crisis its about pulling back on nanny state its about delivering on the gearshift that john key wants in new zealands economic performance
1136265 we believe perhaps the wholesale investors are in a good position to understand the value of the bonds the quality of the assets and the good position the funds in
1136266 the retail investors may be responding to the difficult market conditions and the emotional drivers around how difficult things are now so by leaving it open for them if they do require emergency funds or do need to leave the fund they can still do that
1136267 need to make the point though that if a large number of retail investors more than normal do decide to leave we may be forced to close the a class as well but certainly hope thats not the case
1136268 if you were looking to cast a rock amp roll idol huey lewis would probably not make the final cut hes a strong yet somewhat one dimensional singer hes handsome but older looking than the average rock star and he dances about as well as menudo which is to say not very well but despite those drawbacks and a live show that seems a tad padded with instrumental soloing he gets his wildly enthusiastic predominately female audiences where he wants them on their feet
1136269 why after so long are re entering the work force
1136270 be a leader remember the lead sled dog is the only one with a decent view
1136271 it takes a strong fish to swim against the current
1136272 shed go put her paws on the wheel chair and put her nose right up to ians mouth ian hated it
1136273 ian has had pneumonia 15 times and a respiratory virus that few children survive three times
1136274 then she went into ians room and climbed up in the bed with him
1136275 i took a closer look and realized ian was having a seizure
1136276 so pen head why is she writhing around like a bitch in heat instead of being broken
1136277 she seems to be having an adverse reaction to the sedative that we had to administer
1136278 and why pen head has she been given a sedative
1136279 she was near to blowing off her own head with the restraining collar my queen
1136280 you know that half breed swine like her dont have that much power
1136281 be that as may your majesty perhaps her apparent power stems from the incident in las vegas a few years back
1136282 you should have known better scholnir you have my permission to put her in the draining shackles you know the ones that i mean we usually use them for the wayward elder that happens by but it seems to me that she would benefit from their secure embrace dont you think
1136283 yes mistress you are right as always thank you for your reminder
1136284 dont fail me she will show me the way to my long lost husbands
1136285 i didnt take it bant it was oh so graciously bestowed upon me
1136286 well remind me not to do whatever it is that you did to get this most illustrious gift of a position
1136287 we need to shackle her first with the dampeners then i will more than gladly hit the infirmary the cursed wing will hold long enough
1136288 well the sooner we get this bitch shackled down and under control then the sooner the wing can get looked at
1136289 quit it with the bowing and scarping scholnir youve torn the skin from my hide enough times that i think we are beyond such niceties
1136290 perhaps we are lord seth but it is unseemly for it to be aired publicly
1136291 that was sins get i saw getting carted out of there
1136292 i am afraid that i lost my temper a bit in there
1136293 you know if she dies your life wont be work very much to my dear mother
1136294 oh you mean i am not looking at my executioner right now
1136295 well that was the initial set of orders that i had received then i come to find out that the intelligence that i had gathered at great cost i might add had not been passed onto you
1136296 go ahead and get cleaned up my sometimes friend i will fill you in on exactly why you are being spared this time hell i actually had orders to cull you and your entire team truthfully i would have only felt the barest tinge of regret had i taken the opportunity to carry out my instructions
1136297 joy blessing sin is the daughter of raphael sin emperor of sindadi and all of its holdings
1136298 now my birdies tell me that you already have an inkling of what happened at the great meeting held on earth
1136299 yes though i will be the first to admit that i dont know all that had transpired
1136300 and you obviously dont have the sense to keep your mouth shut around my queen mother that was incredibly stupid on your part scholnir
1136301 the information that should have made its way into your hands has to do with her initial up bringing
1136302 she would starve the girl granted it is not to the extent to which you have the same goes for the beatings that the girl endured
1136303 so youre telling me that she was already pre conditioned for the treatments that she has been receiving here
1136304 if i had known this then we would have gone over to an alternate series of treatments
1136305 i know which is why i pointed this out to my mother
1136306 that wont help you if you are brought to me in chains you know
1136307 there is that you know had you said that to any of my other family members that had been in your tender clutches you would at the very least be in the position most of us had been in a time or two
1136308 you are pushing your luck with me my sometimes friend
1136309 we will start her on a different more subtle regiment of training
1136310 i know that its why i had her on this particular schedule to begin with
1136311 no need to be defensive scholnir i only glossed over her dossier with you i on the other hand know everything about her that has ever been writ i have read her fathers notes her fathers advisors notes her brothers notes in certain respects i know better than anyone who best to break her to my will assuming she can be broken
1136312 as soon as she is healed from your loss of temper speaking of which that show of temper that i got a chance to see the results of is forgive me for saying a bit uncharacteristic of you
1136313 i knew that you or someone like you would be coming for me soon i i lost it i have no wish to be terminated can you understand that
1136314 look on the bright side she is going to be my problem in an hour or so
1136315 that should be sufficient so i will be seeing more of you here then
1136316 i surely hope not i have one mini verse week to get what my mother wants out of her
1136317 nope so in a week if i dont break her i am going to be delivered to you in chains
1136318 that is not a very realistic timetable for this but then again
1136319 then again if you were to gain permission to take her into dawe it becomes more of a workable timeline
1136320 the software will not function until the official release date
1136321 dont worry if everything goes to shit well be there to get you out of the crater youve created for yourself
1136322 to meet the performance and flexibility demands of cutting edge applications from validating semiconductor chips to testing consumer electronic devices engineers must adopt the latest technologies such as multicore processors and fpgas
1136323 through parallel programming with labview graphical system design software engineers can apply these new technologies quickly and easily to improve test performance and capability
1136324 ive spoken to one of the chaps involved in the movie since its dvd debut last week and he promises me that there will definitely be more sam and alan in
1136325 we went through that last year in atlanta with michael vick the media and on tv and people outside may think its a distraction but us as players weve got to come out here and practice were not talking about that on the practice field
1136326 each person who has a job being focused to do it so everybody else can depend on him and they are accountable for it
1136327 i knew they werent just signing me and that was it i knew they were going to bring young guys in thats a part of the nfl youve got to go out there and do your job
1136328 i missed a lot on ir but it was nothing too serious im feeling good right now so im ready to go

1136335 they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1136336 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain
1136337 i told them i needed my medicine but they didnt give me anything
1136338 she told me after a month in detention that she still hadnt seen a doctor
1136339 i told her i could send her more medicine but she said they would not give it to her they were mostly giving her tylenol
1136340 he told me that victoria wasnt eating and was urinating blood but that the officials still were not paying her any mind
1136341 he told me get outside help but try not to worry
1136342 her foot was chained to the bed and when she tried to turn over it would hurt her
1136343 that made it twice as hard it was so humiliating no human should have to live their last days like that
1136344 the 9cs which make a leader stand out from the crowd

1136353 before and immediately after 8 august we will not see persistent heavy rainfall

1136358 in fact the bit that tv3 didnt play has me saying that while some of our supporters worry about kiwibank its actually working
1136359 so no theres no issues of public trust our positions quite clear
1136360 if theres any change to that position and were not working on that but if theres any change to that position we will go out with a mandate we will go out to seek that mandate by going out and asking the voters of new zealand whether they support a particular policy or not
1136361 the author of works without which the history of the 20th century is unthinkable
1136362 gives a certain hope and alexander isayevich solzhenitsyn would be glad if that hope came to life a hope our country will learn the lesson of its self destruction in the 20th century and not repeat it
1136363 we are not supporting some things the current government is and we are supporting a bigger tax cut programme

1136374 the more complex the mind the greater the need for the simplicity of play
1136375 none of what they do is going to stop us from delivering our message

1136377 este caso foi descaracterizado existem temas mais complexos do que apenas quebra de direitos autorais ou viola o de marca como o respeito licen a de uso e temas antitruste
1136378 mas d uma olhada no site do advogado que representa a apple a apple sabe onde isso vai dar
1136379 creio que porque esse tema bem maior que simples copyright

1136381 a psystar pode argumentar que quer usar os recursos nicos do sistema operacional do mac em uma gama maior de hardware

1136385 i have to say that we are very sad for felipe
1136386 if you are mentally able to manage this kind of race after such a big disappointment you have to take a step forward because you get stronger this is what we are all going to do together because thats the way we are going to approach the next race in valencia
1136387 we prepared the race last night considering that we knew that in these conditions the two effects were relevant we tried to simulate the start in terms of lines because we knew that if we were in front we could set a good pace for the first stint of the race we were building and informing felipe of the gap behind him to hamilton just to create our race expecting him to be i would say in the region of our pit stop maybe one two laps more one two laps less so we were working around that strategy we were building up our lead considering that situation but to be honest you never know how its going to work out up to the moment that you stop

1136391 and on the other hand qualifying is crucial and the difference today was really the fact that on one side massa we were able to jump in front and do our own race as we were able to do and on the hand r ikk nen spending the first part of the race in the middle of the field knowing that it was really impossible to do something in spite of having the right pace
1136392 what we need to improve looking ahead to the next grand prix is our situation in tricky conditions which may be in terms of temperature in terms of situation weather something like that for sure we maybe need to prepare our cars and tyre set up in a different way because we saw what we suffered for example in germany
1136393 in fact the bit that tv3 didnt play has me saying that while some of our supporters worry about kiwibank its actually working
1136394 so no theres no issues of public trust our positions quite clear
1136395 if theres any change to that position and were not working on that but if theres any change to that position we will go out with a mandate we will go out to seek that mandate by going out and asking the voters of new zealand whether they support a particular policy or not

1136407 the first and simplest emotion which we discover in the human mind is curiosity
1136408 it is a shameful thing to be weary of inquiry when what we search for is excellent
1136409 curiosity is in great and generous minds the first passion and the last
1136410 i think at a childs birth if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift that gift would be curiosity
1136411 be curious always for knowledge will not acquire you you must acquire it
1136412 i think knowing what you cannot do is more important than knowing what you can
1136413 it is not good to know more unless we do more with what we already know
1136414 the essence of knowledge is having it to apply it not having it to confess your ignorance
1136415 i would have the studies elective scholarship is to be created not by compulsion but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge the wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself the marking is a system for schools not for the college for boys not for men and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor

1136422 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1136423 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1136424 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1136425 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1136437 there arent that many good paying manufacturing jobs left and weve gotta fight hard to keep the ones that we have and we have a lot 800 of them right here in baldwinsville
1136438 to make matters worse every time you blink you hear of some factory leaving this count
1136439 we feel we do a very good job here and i believe anheuser busch feels the same seeing weve always negotiated good contract s they like the work we do and we enjoy the work and just want to continue the work that we do
1136440 we are very proud of that that will make us more productive and we think thats the right type of investment for our operation
1136441 we recognize the important role that the operations of anheuser busch and its partners have played in the economy of the regions they operate in and we will work to preserve those benefits we have a deep respect for the leadership people and history that have made anheuser busch what it is today

1136463 they all said he had throat cancer an easy conclusion because he was well known for drinking smoking and using tobacco in fact he died of a very rare cancer and what i found out was that this larger than life celebrity was a pioneer in early cancer research
1136464 i do know hes very remorseful for what he did and hes going to pay the price
1136465 he had two days off down there and he drove in five runs in two days
1136466 so it worked out pretty good i can live with that id certainly like to get it maybe three on and one off were just going to see how it goes with his shoulder
1136467 hes not in any pain his range of motion is just not good
1136468 i guess it just depends on how much more range of motion he gets if he feels good about it well go from there
1136469 as we launch the 16th annual rbi world series it is important to note that these games feature more than just great baseball and softball
1136470 this year we have been able to recognize and reward the off field talents of many young athletes through the rbi for rbi scholarship program jointly funded by major league baseball and kpmg on behalf of major league baseball i congratulate every player and coach who has reached the series rbi is a great example of major league baseballs commitment to reaching out to and providing boys and girls the opportunity to play the game and improve their lives

1136475 we have a tremendous team but the reality is we are playing below our expectations and have been inconsistent
1136476 i think overall we are playing more consistent and things are shaping up for us to have a winning record but we have to keep working hard if we want to make the playoffs everybody in here knows its a long season
1136477 hes basically carried the team hes been the big guy

1136489 mereka bersepakat bahwa wajib atas kaum muslimin untuk mengangkat khalifah
1136490 mengangkat imam bagi orang yang mampu menegakkannya di tengah umat adalah wajib dengan berdasarkan ijma

1136499 dan allah tidak akan menjadikan bagi orang orang kafir jalan atas orang orang mukmin

1136513 na het recente vertrek van twee spitsen was het vooral in dat compartiment dat we nood hadden aan vers bloed met wesley sonck haalden we iemand die zich zeer snel bij ons moet kunnen aanpassen wesley is belg en hij is voor een speler met zijn ervaring zelfs nog relatief jong want pas 29 geworden ik reken sterk op zijn revanchegevoel wesley heeft een grote inspanning geleverd op financieel vlak om de transfer mogelijk te maken hij zal dan ook ongetwijfeld snel willen tonen dat hij nog niets van zijn kwaliteiten heeft ingeboet

1136582 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
1136583 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
1136584 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
1136585 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
1136586 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
1136587 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
1136588 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
1136589 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
1136590 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

1136710 the problem is now in punjab where the trucks from either side are stranded
1136711 they have sought our co operation and we have responded unconditionally politics at the centre and in the state is different
1136712 we have chosen veerana mathikatti as our candidate for the chairmans post in consultation with the high command we have negotiated support from the jd s in return for supporting their candidate for the deputy chairmans post we spoke to kumaraswamy and they have agreed
1136713 we allowed him to accept the post as speaker in the context of our decision to support the upa once the support is withdrawn his continuance in office becomes untenable we asked him to step down but he refused what he did was he refused to abide by the decision of the party
1136714 we havent interfered with his constitutional functions and duties he was a party member at that time and we only asked him to abide by the partys decision
1136715 the bjp knew that it could not defeat the upa on the floor of the house as it did not have the numbers therefore they wanted to enact an episode to use it as an issue in the coming elections
1136716 in the whole scenario the step by step planning in that planning advaniji rajnathji and one more person was involved

1136720 i consider what has been shown in the cd to be untrue there is no truth in this
1136721 we too possess an audio visual cd which we want to submit to you
1136722 the bjp should be thanked it has united the three divided stalwarts of social justice
1136723 it the new cd doesnt respond to the charges against singh that we brought out in the open everybody agrees that sanjeev saxena had come with the money and delivered it to three bjp mps now the only question that arises is who is saxena and whom is he associated with
1136724 the move by the three parties amounted to the formation of a cabinet committee on forgery and fabrication
1136725 the phone conversation between saxena and amar singh proves the latters involvement in the cash for vote scam
1136726 i am a little disappointed because ultimately it is the womans right to choose however taking this case the high court could have given directives to draft fresh guidelines
1136727 this matter was important enough for the judiciary to look beyond legislation
1136728 i believe the apprehension is that if one allows abortion beyond the stipulated time it will abuse the current law mtp act is a terrific act the best abortion law in the world but it needs to be updated the current act is based on the technology used in 1971 with newer techniques the law should be amended
1136729 i honestly feel justice would have only been served if termination was allowed according to the report submitted by the expert committee both paediatrics as well as cardiologists all suggested termination
1136730 the law that we have is in line with the rights based approach to human life and probably no court would ever say that you are allowed to abort the child after 20 weeks of pregnancy if the court had allowed it the misuse would be very heavy the worry is foeticide we are already a country where we are managing strict laws for making sure that such malpractice is removed
1136731 a lot of suffering is involved in bringing up an abnormal child in this case it is clear that the child will have to be fitted with a pacemaker every few years most civilized countries allow abortions when it is established that the child will have a lifelong ailment and the parents plea was completely justified the law needs to be changed
1136732 by keeping the legal limit at 20 weeks we are forcing parents to rush into a decision many times abnormalities are detected after the 20th week it is not possible to detect all complications within 20 weeks
1136733 we need to revise the law and be easy on parents as well
1136734 abnormalities of the heart as in the case of the mehtas kidney and spine are usually not clear till last stages of pregnancy in such cases abortions should be allowed
1136735 the mtp act in india is very clear if its an unwanted pregnancy till 12 weeks only one registered mtp provider can certify that the pregnancy can be terminated between 12 20 weeks the termination of pregnancy has to be certified by two providers registered under mtp act
1136736 we cannot go against the law of the land but when we come across a case when the child is not capable of surviving the usual policy is to constitute an expert committee besides the childs chances of survival doctors consider the parents situation before decision on the likelihood of abortion
1136737 tearing me down every time you smile every shiny time you arrive
1136738 i feel comfortable here the indian community is here we share common values lifestyle and culture
1136739 there is also easy access to supermarkets and groceries cost of food is cheaper too

1136751 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1136752 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1136753 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama

1136760 into her bubbling cauldron of creativity author lanaia lee decided to toss such tempting ingredients as fantasy magic romance betrayal revenge and the eternal battle of good vs evil the result of atlantis a novel thats very hard to put down once you start reading it
1136761 i am a sucker for all things atlantis and so i looked forward with drooling anticipation when presented with of atlantis by lanaia lee the plot has plenty of action especially in the way of hand to hand bloodletting skirmishes the plot also has intriguing twists as the young archimedes explores his powers and his father fed with false information becomes suspicious of former friends the best character by far is uric evil personified his black soul enables him everlasting life nearly his only realistic adversary for the bulk of the novel is the boy archimedes but will he survive long enough to gain sufficient power to both discover the true wickedness of uric and then defeat him meanwhile archimedes although with an extended lifespan suffers especially when his mortal loves and family have to die the writing style isnt how i would have written or edited it but we are all different and this book should have heaps of appeal to teens and young adults and of course to other aficionados of all things atlantis

1136774 most men even in this comparitively free country through mere ignorance and mistake are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them their fingers from excessive toil are too clumsy and tremble too much for that actually the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men his labor would be depreciated by the market he has no time to be anything but a machine some of you we all know are poor find it hard to live are sometimes as it were gasping for breath i have no doubt that some of you who read this are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out and have come to this page to spend borrowed or stolen times robbing your creditors of an hour it is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live for my sight has been whetted by experience always on the limits trying to get into business and trying to get out of debt a very ancient slough called by the ancient romans aes alienum anothers brass for some of their coins were made of brass still living and dying and buried by this others brass always promising to pay promising to pay to morrow and dying to day insolvent seeking to curry favor to get custom by how many modes only not state prison offenses lying flattering voting contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes or his hat or his coat or his carriage or import his groceries for him making yourself sick that you may lay up something against a sick day something to be tucked away in an old chest or in a stocking behind the plastering or more safely in the brick bank no matter where no matter how much or how little i sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous i may almost say as to attend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called negro slavery there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both north and south

1136804 the most important cannabis resin producers in the near east
1136805 what locals describe as one of their best cannabis crops since the 1975 1990 civil war
1136806 to clear a few marijuana or opium fields for the press just to show that the lebanese government is addressing the drugs problem
1136807 is dominated by the industrial production of and trade in drugs
1136808 allows lebanese dealers to smuggle drugs into israel in exchange for which they provide hizbullah through their israeli contacts with intelligence information on the deployment of the idf in the north and purchase maps and equipment for hizbullah
1136809 the nexus between drugs and terror is growing at light speed one of the most prominent regions where the drug terror nexus is at its strongest is the tri border area in latin america where the borders of brazil argentina and paraguay join both hamas and hizbullah are active in this region

1136812 is this a real terrorist attack and are there more explosive laden vans
1136813 since 1968 over 90 of the terrorists incidents globally have been bombings
1136814 i really think that we will prevent the next terrorist attack hopefully we will prevent the next terrorist attack by good intelligence and information sharing
1136815 weve gotten feedback direct feedback from major law enforcement agencies that theyve changed some of their security and protective measures for special events based on the information that we are able to provide them
1136816 the ability now to take products like hydrogen peroxide and to convert that into a bomb is fairly easy and those types of materials can be purchased fairly readily
1136817 i dont think its as readily able to happen here recruiting and infiltrating has been made difficult surveillance doing the things getting the truck getting the materials getting a hotel room using an atm machine using a cell phone all of the things that take place i think weve been able to disrupt that

1136822 this abhorrent film will only add to the anguish of families who have suffered a great deal over a year for their loved ones who have been kept in captivity i call on the hostage takers to release these people who have been held in captivity immediately
1136823 i will work with the iraqi government as i said to prime minister maliki yesterday to secure their release and we will do everything in our power to work with everyone who is in a position to help us release these hostages these men have suffered enough

1136840 vanessa manifest your muscles atrophy looks a lot like the last years of your journal
1136841 make up your mind if you wont take her i will
1136842 i think i have done a good job in rising politically in this environment without being entangled in some of the traditional problems of chicago politics
1136843 i know there are those like john kass who would like me to decry chicago politics more frequently and ill leave that to his editorial commentary
1136844 to a large degree the media has accepted much of the obama narrative thus far
1136845 hes risen so quickly but his history hasnt been bogged down with an association of chicago politics and i cant tell you why exactly except perhaps that some may have bought into the established narrative and cant separate themselves from it
1136846 and i dont know if the country understands just how corrupt the system is in illinois people dont see it theyre flying over us cruising at 30 000 feet
1136847 no one should have to live like this and no one did anything about it
1136848 consistently fought to make livable affordable housing in mixed income neighborhoods available to all
1136849 government is just not as good at owning and managing as the private sector because the incentives are not there
1136850 i would argue that someone living in a poor neighborhood that isnt 100 percent public housing is by definition better off
1136851 they are rapidly displacing poor people and these companies are profiting from this displacement
1136852 the same exact people who ran these places into the ground
1136853 the developers were thinking in market terms and operating under the rules of the marketplace but at the same time we had government supporting and subsidizing those efforts
1136854 he was someone we could go to and count on him to be there
1136855 i will restore the federal governments commitment to low income housing
1136856 our nations low income families are facing an affordable housing crisis and it is our responsibility to ensure this crisis does not get worse by ineffective replacement of existing public housing units
1136857 grove parc is quite an exception to what weve normally done because its in such bad shape
1136858 these complexes are often tired theyre always denser than todays philosophy but theyre not usually anywhere near as deteriorated
1136859 in the winter i can feel the cold air coming through the walls and the sockets
1136860 you could hear them under the floor and in the walls and they didnt do nothing about it
1136861 its difficult if not impossible for a private company to maintain affordable housing for low income tenants
1136862 i started getting complaints from police officers about particular properties that turned out to be rezko properties
1136863 i didnt see him nor have anything to do with him after that
1136864 the margin of error at sedgwick was a little too close to begin with
1136865 throughout his career in public service barack obama has advocated for the development of mixed income housing and public private partnerships to create affordable housing as an alternative to publicly subsidized concentrated low income housing
1136866 what i am against is some of the people around him
1136867 i hope there is not much predictive value in his history and in his involvement with that community
1136868 two years ago watching the olympics live via the internet was limited to a single gold medal game of a popular sport this year everything from preliminary table tennis matches to team handball will be available both live and on demand directly to the pc
1136869 new short term and long term solutions to the energy crisis that were facing
1136870 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here
1136871 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
1136872 im not giving the gavel away to a tactic that supports the oil companies big oil at the cost and the expense of the consumer
1136873 basically cools the passion of environmentalists knowing its not going anywhere while he is open to compromise on a comprehensive package that would achieve many other objectives
1136874 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but
1136875 obamas narrative is being altered enhanced and manipulated to whitewash troubling facts
1136876 the millions of u s children who have been carted abroad dont spend enough time in their adopted countries to become fully bicultural but they take pieces and add it to their home values and traditions studies have shown that kids who have spent time abroad are more likely to go to college and to relate to one another despite the influences of vastly differing cultures
1136877 from 1992 until his election to the u s senate in 2004 barack obama served as a professor in the law school he was a lecturer from 1992 to 1996 he was a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004 during which time he taught three courses per year senior lecturers are considered to be members of the law school faculty and are regarded as professors although not full time or tenure track the title of senior lecturer is distinct from the title of lecturer which signifies adjunct status like obama each of the law schools senior lecturers has high demand careers in politics or public service which prevent full time teaching several times during his 12 years as a professor in the law school obama was invited to join the faculty in a full time tenure track position but he declined
1136878 no single change would add more to public understanding of how money really operates in washington
1136879 i dont have i dont maintain a file of eight years of work in the state senate because i didnt have the resources available to maintain those kinds of records
1136880 in no possible way was i inferring that he obama was going to introduce any policies that you should ignore and he had no intention of enacting
1136881 once the bus is in the ditch there are only so many ways to get it out

1136885 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1136886 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1136887 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1136888 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1136889 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1136890 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
1136891 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
1136892 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
1136893 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
1136894 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
1136895 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1136896 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1136897 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1136898 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1136899 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1136900 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1136901 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1136902 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
1136903 ok ok i get it mccain doesnt know anything about the economy leave the poor guy alone already
1136904 you can have a victim of whatever age you like so long as its seven
1136905 and science can advance even without coherent models unified theories or really any mechanistic explanation at all
1136906 finally markets and google both suffer from one severe defect they are highly effective at identifying two separate things as the same but very bad at specifying the difference between them
1136907 people are incapable of becoming as stupid as these strategies require
1136908 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
1136909 i dont think there is any realistic chance of modalities being agreed this year or in the foreseeable future and that is a source of deep regret in europe
1136910 its historic role in authorising changes or modifications to the authoritative root zone file
1136911 the transition of the technical coordination of the management function related to the internet domain name and addressing system dns to the private sector
1136912 that it is important to clarify that we are not in discussions with either party to change the respective roles of the department icann or verisign regarding the management of the authoritative root zone file nor do we have any plans to undertake such discussions
1136913 discussions on the three trips issues during the ministerial meeting and possible ways to address them were mostly limited to process matters that would not entail significant changes in comparison with existing deliberations on these issues
1136914 for us if the geographical indications are not maintained the agreement will not be closed
1136915 sometimes i wear them for fights and sometimes i dont
1136916 i see okay without them its just for the clarity really i have lenses that are specially made for my eyes and they stay real tight to the eyes ive had some start to fall out in the past and i just knock them out with my fingers and get back into battle
1136917 i caught nogueira with a kick and had the chance to finish him
1136918 lots of people ask me whether i regret not finishing him and i always tell them i have no regrets whatsoever
1136919 it was a wake up call it made me want to become serious rededicate myself and actually put my all into this thing i wasnt really training properly back then i was training and thinking more like an amateur
1136920 honestly i didnt know too much about him before he started doing mma
1136921 as a kid i used to watch that sort of stuff wrestling but that was way before brock became involved with it i never really knew who he was or paid attention to him
1136922 hes a big strong guy and hes able to use that weight effectively and to his advantage
1136923 youve got to give him respect for that i like coming in and being a bit of an underdog im just excited to be involved in a fight that everyone is talking about
1136924 ive fought bigger guys than him and better wrestlers than him
1136925 i walk into this fight and every other fight absolutely fearless who am i going to be scared of at this stage of my career i know what ive got to do and i know what im capable of
1136926 to be honest im really really confident for this fight
1136927 i know exactly what i need to do to win and barring any unforeseen bad luck im really not even worried about this fight
1136928 its nice going into a fight knowing you have the skill set and the ability to take out your opponent i think he knows that too and i think hes real nervous about this fight and he should be hes fighting a very well seasoned and well travelled veteran who has fought all over the world against the best guys put it this way id rather be on this side of the fence than brocks side i wouldnt want to be in his corner
1136929 hes fighting in his hometown and hes coming off a first round defeat if he goes 0 2 lesnar could be done in the ufc thats a lot of pressure right there and something we will look to exploit im a completely different beast to the two guys lesnars fought so far mirs very comfortable on his back and i think actually gave up several takedowns just to get there and the korean guy he fought min soo kim was just a tomato can
1136930 keeping the fight standing will definitely give me an advantage
1136931 actually anywhere the fight goes i feel ill have an advantage in certain aspects brocks inexperienced hes new to the game and there are certain things he wont know and wont be able to execute against me
1136932 if you want to really get down to the nitty gritty of it all and be honest this is a lose lose situation as far as im concerned
1136933 the only reason im taking this fight is because the ufc offered it and the fans want it it really doesnt make any sense for me to be taking this fight otherwise i guess im just an entertainer this is what i do
1136934 brocks never been in a scrap with anybody that has got the abilities i have my punching my kicking my scrambling off the ground its all well and good watching videos of me and saying youre going to do this and that but its a lot more difficult getting into the octagon and executing things youve never done before to be honest im not sure how hes going to handle me i dont even think he knows how hes going to react
1136935 its a fight youre going to get in awkward situations and dangerous places no matter how much you plan and hope to stay out of them youre in with another guy who is trying to do the same kind of stuff youre doing to him this isnt pro wrestling it isnt scripted

1136940 is without doubt a man of vision and i look forward to partnering with him on new and exciting challenges
1136941 as a distribution company p amp h is of course particularly impacted by fuel costs as they form a signficant part of our overall costs structure until now we have absorbed this significant cost pressure but now we are forced regrettably into passing some of this on to our customers
1136942 the incredible and unanticipated increase in fuel costs has caused us much heartache and worry
1136943 we have to see evidence of what their increased costs are so that we can see that they are increasing the costs of the holiday by the appropriate amount
1136944 if people have booked a year or a year and a half in advance for example to take advantage of free child place offers they could not have foreseen the huge rises
1136945 if it was the other way around and fuel costs were going down how many consumers would get money back
1136946 sensible in trying to keep the temperature as low as possible
1136947 rumble on because it cant be resolved with two great cultural gaps
1136948 overall the conference did less damage than it could have
1136949 an educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false misleading fictitious mendacious just dead wrong
1136950 skate 2 be on your radar absolutely we both probably
1136951 skate 2 was already looking leaps and bounds better visually it still looked rough but my guess is the guys at development studio
1136952 skate 2 benefit from that partnership no one at the event was talking though they acknowledged fans requests for it it didnt seem likely though
1136953 skate 2 doesnt have a release date yet and is completely separate from
1136954 our hope is to go as far as possible to harmonize all viable proposals into a regional health care system that benefits each partner provides the highest quality health care and serves as an economic engine for the region and state
1136955 by working together and implementing this plan we believe hartford will join new york and boston as one of the nations premier biomedical hubs for teaching research and cutting edge patient care
1136956 this is a plan primarily promoted by one consulting group it should not be confused with an esop employee stock ownership plan which is sanctioned by federal law
1136957 the irs had an opportunity to stop them cold and they didnt
1136958 the federal pension law erisa and the internal revenue code governing these arrangements permit a company to maintain more than one tax qualified retirement plan for its employees
1136959 your employees salary deferral contributions into the 401 k plan could be separately invested in mutual funds or other investments that are unrelated to the ersops investment in your companys stock
1136960 since the rollover feature of the plan is designed to benefit only one plan participant the structure may be subject to a number of attacks on its qualified status including its ability to comply with the exclusive benefit rule of section 401 a of the internal revenue code
1136961 if they did and that logic seems compelling then your company must at least do a few things that will cost some tens of thousands of dollars
1136962 most of our franchisees did the same thing in their local markets
1136963 this marketplace has grown significantly which means theres a lot of restaurants and a lot of seats and not enough people to fill those seats
1136964 we set our own royalty rates we have our own meetings
1136965 when we said we werent going to raise more capital we said we were adequately capitalized at that point in time
1136966 if we lose more money going forward we may have to raise more money and that was always true
1136967 as shareholders redeemed their shares the selling shareholders were overpaid depleting the funds reserves and harming the plaintiffs
1136968 plaintiffs purchased at an inflated price and were also damaged by the funds failure to properly redeem the shares of the fund investors at a price representing the correct net asset value

1137398 if we had a beat constable system he would have noticed three strangers at the seminary and inquired
1137399 the beat drill failed and the ayodhya attack happened then waliullah was charged but the absence of pota prevention of terrorism act made it easy for him to get bail
1137400 when he got bail he went to bangladesh and set up a network to send indian youth to help carry out bombings with training in pakistan

1137433 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1137434 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes

1137437 we also circulated over 200 000 books across our twelve library system that is the first time that we have reached that we are very excited about that it was hot outside but people were reading inside

1137443 it is imperative that texas officials stay the execution of jos medellin not only because of the pending world court decision but also to take into account recent congressional action on this issue
1137444 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jos medellins execution goes forward
1137445 flouting the world court ruling would be yet another blight on americas already tarnished international reputation
1137446 texas has a responsibility to respect u s commitments particularly those which also serve to protect american citizens abroad and in an era of increasing distrust over the united states ability to use its power fairly and wisely governor perry should seriously consider whether he wants his actions to further strain u s relationships with important allies

1137458 the overall package detracts from the ability to seamlessly use this camera as an extension of my eye this is a factor of both form and function it is not a camera that feels sure in the hand the finish smoothness certainly contributes to this as does the lack of an optical finder
1137459 i like the sony dsc h10 it is a handy size for a camera with such a long lens it takes a good photo in most circumstances and has very low shutter lag times
1137460 the h10 is a compact long zoom point and shoot camera that reliably takes pictures in auto mode and offers good value for money there are a few negatives you should have in mind but image quality is decent most of all like its predecessor it is a fun to use camera that you can carry wherever you go

1137462 these findings are significant because the national health and nutrition examination survey shows 58 percent of all current drinkers in the united states reported usual alcohol consumption that exceeded the dietary guidelines and 52 percent of all current drinkers reported at least one episode of binge drinking in the past year
1137463 most people who consume alcohol in the united states drink in ways that may increase their risk of the metabolic syndrome and related conditions
1137464 since more than half of current drinkers in our study drank in excess of the dietary guidelines limits and reported binge drinking prevention efforts should focus on reducing alcohol consumption to safer levels
1137465 unfortunately few physicians screen their patients about alcohol use or are knowledgeable about guidelines that define low risk or moderate drinking
1137466 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1137467 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1137468 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people

1137546 few people know much about what mormons believe and mormons often dont explain their deep doctrine to outsiders
1137547 and why is it always mormons that have to do the explaining given 500 years of protestant disagreement and confusion
1137548 perhaps because the rhetoric of possessing the true doctrine in evangelical circles does even come close to the prevalence of such rhetoric in mormonism
1137549 i agree with john c i think evangelicals are every bit as strident on these issues as mormons are

1137614 we were pleased to have met our previously stated expectations for the quarter despite a challenging domestic economy and very tough conditions in several of our end markets we are prudently addressing our cost position in the near term to ensure we weather the current economic environment while we build a leaner more efficient platform from which sustainable value can be created over the long term
1137615 at the beginning of this year we announced that we would continue to invest in our logistics and information infrastructure as well as in select growth initiatives in the facilities maintenance end market in order to ensure long term profitable sales and earnings growth for interline brands our plans are to continue supporting these initiatives while we have discussed many of these initiatives over the past year we are stepping out this quarter with a more detailed roadmap we are announcing plans that should allow us to reduce our annual operating costs by 20 million and reduce working capital by 20 million over the next several years we look forward to sharing the details of our plans on our second quarter earnings call tomorrow
1137616 sales to the facilities maintenance end market posted positive growth during the quarter sales to the multi family housing market grew despite extremely difficult 20 organic growth comparables for 2007 while sales in the institutional market continued to grow at a level consistent with historical performance these results were offset by continued declines in the smaller pro contractor and specialty distributor end markets
1137617 as we look ahead to the second half of the year we are faced with similar trends that affected our performance in the first half of 2008 on a relative basis profitability in the second half of the year will be higher than the first half due to a seasonally stronger third and fourth quarter we therefore expect earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008 to be between 41 and 46 cents due to one time costs including the two cents per share charge related to mr sanford and four cents per share related to our operational initiatives which will be discussed in our conference call tomorrow we expect earnings per share for the full year 2008 to be between 1 40 and 1 50

1137651 very early in the process senators dole and burr helped lead the effort to ensure the harmful medicare regulation highly detrimental to the health care needs of north carolina seniors would not go into effect
1137652 senators dole and burr helped make sure the administration was aware of the impending funding cuts for north carolina medicare beneficiaries and were among the very first senators to co sign a letter to health and human services hhs secretary mike leavitt
1137653 jeopardize the significant quality improvements made by the skilled nursing facility snf community in recent years as well as the ability of snfs to continue caring for high acuity patients because snfs rely on medicare to make up for chronic underfunding by the medicaid program an average of 13 per day for every medicaid beneficiary in nursing homes nationwide it is critically important that medicare reimbursement remain fair and consistent we believe that if the administration were to finalize its proposed rule the ability of providers to care for our nations most vulnerable population the frail elderly and disabled would be severely threatened
1137654 from a health policy standpoint the cancellation of the medicare regulation last week is an outstanding development in terms of both meeting seniors changing health care needs and doing so in a manner that uses medicare funds efficiently senators dole and burr deserve enormous credit for working in an intelligent bipartisan manner to help achieve a result highly beneficial to every north carolina medicare beneficiary

1137814 with the first full quarter of consolidation of our parliament business and approximately one month of earnings from our whitehall operations we are pleased to see continuing strong underlying growth trends in our overall business
1137815 we continue to see double digit growth coming from our key vodka brands in poland led by strong performance from our premium vodka brand bols we also continue to see strong consumer demand for imported wines and spirits with sales of our import portfolio up over 40 as compared to the second quarter last year the strong polish currency has contributed to keeping our raw material prices down especially our main cost component raw spirit
1137816 on july 9th 2008 we closed our 42 investment in the russian alcohol group the largest vodka producer in russia which has positioned our company to take full advantage of the strong growth trends in the mainstream and sub premium vodka sectors in russia we look forward to working with lion capital to improve the operating performance of the russian alcohol group and to address potential synergies between our operations
1137817 as a result of our strong second quarter performance we are raising our full year 2008 net sales guidance from 1 57 1 70 billion to 1 65 1 80 billion and our full year comparable fully diluted earnings per share guidance from 2 65 2 80 to 2 75 2 95 we plan to update our full year 2009 guidance in the fall of this year based on the ongoing performance of our business
1137818 the koran is like a big store a supermarket in this book you are able to pick different answers you are able to make peace according to the koran you are able to declare war
1137819 with respect to the mancos initial production rates we are seeing good pressures and expected rates in the new cost saving mancos blackhawk dual completions what we are finding is that while we can complete the blackhawk during the first mobilization the mancos still has higher pressures and somewhat suppresses the blackhawk contribution as observed from the federal 34 30 and the federal 41 19 it appears that as the mancos pressures down the blackhawk begins flowing and what we see are wells that actually have stable to inclining production rates up to 60 days or more following the dual completion later we can return to recomplete up hole in the upper mesaverde and wasatch
1137820 we are pleased with the results from what is our best quarter ever
1137821 we have been fortunate to be able to continue to flow all of our natural gas production due to our agreement with a third party that provides for purchases of up to 50 000 mmbtu per day thru 2009 the contract we believe will be sufficient to handle our estimated gross production for that period our hedged volumes for 2008 and 2009 should provide some protection against any downward movement in price here in the rockies should pipeline service dates and other takeaway issues further erode the basis approximately 50 of our current daily net production is hedged at prices between 6 00 and 6 91 per mmbtu
1137822 this morning us airways began charging fliers 2 for bottled water and sodas and 1 for teas and coffees first class members trans atlantic passengers and a select group of others are exempt from the extra fees
1137823 fail to act to correct imbalance or consistent bias from the networks
1137824 a blatant attempt to use the governments licensing power to enforce certain political views or standards
1137825 youve got to remember that we were always looking over our shoulders in that white house
1137826 they were a lot more interested in fighting with the democrats over vietnam and watergate than in telecommunications policy they wanted everything we did to be a part of that fight and colson was the big gun he could have shut us down at any time in fact he almost did when whitehead called for the abolition of the fairness doctrine
1137827 gehst du mich kurz an den bahnhof ins aperto posten
1137828 nemmeno una rosa rossa nel mio giardino ripet e i suoi begli occhi si riempirono di lacrime oh da che misere cose dipende la felicit ho letto tutto quello che i saggi hanno scritto e possiedo ogni segreto della filosofia ma ora poich mi manca una rosa rossa la mia vita rovinata
1137829 ecco dunque un vero innamorato disse lusignolo notte dopo notte ho cantato per lui anche se non lo conoscevo notte dopo notte ho raccontato la sua storia alle stelle e finalmente lo vedo i suoi capelli sono scuri come il bulbo del giacinto e le sue labbra sono rosse come la rosa che bramerebbe avere ma la passione ha reso il suo viso pallido come avorio e il dolore ha impresso il suo sigillo sulla sua fronte
1137830 il principe dar un ballo domani sera mormor il giovane studente e il mio amore ci andr se le porter una rosa rossa lei danzer con me fino allalba se le porter una rosa rossa la potr tenere tra le mie braccia e lei appogger il suo capo sulla mia spalla e la sua mano stringer la mia ma non c nemmeno una rosa rossa nel mio giardino cosicch io sieder da solo e lei mi passer vicino non si curer di me e il mio cuore sar spezzato
1137831 ecco dunque un vero innamorato disse lusignolo per ci di cui io canto lui soffre ci che gioia per me per lui sofferenza certamente lamore una cosa meravigliosa e pi prezioso di uno smeraldo e pi raro del pi splendido opale le perle e i granati non riescono a comprarlo e nemmeno si riesce a trovarlo al mercato non pu essere acquistato dai mercanti n pu essere pesato su un bilancino per loro
1137832 lorchestra sieder sul palco disse il giovane studente e suoner e il mio amore baller al ritmo dellarpa e del violino danzer con leggerezza senza nemmeno toccare il pavimento e i cortigiani si affolleranno nei loro vestiti variopinti attorno a lei ma con me non baller non ho una rosa rossa da donarle
1137833 dammi una rosa rossa esclam e ti canter la mia canzone pi dolce
1137834 le mie rose sono bianche rispose bianche come la schiuma del mare e pi bianche della neve sulle montagne ma vai da mio fratello che cresce vicino alla vecchia meridiana e forse lui ti dar quello che desideri
1137835 dammi una rosa rossa esclam e ti canter la mia canzone pi dolce
1137836 le mie rose sono gialle rispose gialle come il capelli della ninfa marina che siede vicino al trono dambra e pi gialle dellasfodelo che spunta nel prato prima che il giardiniere giunga con la sua falce ma vai da mio fratello che cresce vicino alla finestra dello studente e forse lui ti dar quello che desideri
1137837 dammi una rosa rossa esclam e ti canter la mia canzone pi dolce
1137838 le mie rose sono rosse rispose rosse come le zampe della colomba e pi rosse dei grandi ventagli di corallo che ondeggiano nelle caverne delloceano ma linverno ha gelato le mie vene e il gelo ha fatto cadere i miei germogli e la tempesta ha spezzato i miei rami e io non avr pi rose per questanno
1137839 una sola rosa rossa mi basta insistette lusignolo solo una rosa rossa non c nessun modo per averla
1137840 c un modo disse il cespuglio ma cos terribile che non oso parlartene
1137841 se vuoi una rosa rossa prosegu il cespuglio devi costruirtela con il tuo canto alla luce della luna e colorarla col sangue del tuo cuore devi cantare per me con il petto squarciato da una spina devi cantare tutta la notte e la spina deve straziare il tuo cuore e il tuo sangue il tuo fluido vitale deve scorrere nelle mie vene diventando il mio
1137842 la morte un caro prezzo da pagare per una rosa rossa si lament lusignolo e la vita cara a tutti e bello stare nel folto degli alberi e seguire il corso del sole sul suo carro dorato e della luna sul suo cocchio di perle dolce il profumo del biancospino e dolci sono le campanule che si nascondono nella valle e lerica che cresce sulla collina per lamore pi bello della vita e cos il cuore di un piccolo uccellino paragonato al cuore di un uomo
1137843 sii allegro disse lusignolo sii allegro avrai la tua rosa rossa te la costruir con il mio canto alla luce della luna e la colorer con il sangue del mio cuore tutto quello che ti chiedo in cambio che tu sia un buon innamorato poich lamore pi saggio della filosofia bench essa sia saggia e pi forte della stessa forza la quale tuttavia potente le ali dellamore sono colore di fiamma e colore di fiamma il suo corpo le sue labbra sono dolci come il miele e il suo alito profumato come lincenso
1137844 cantami unultima canzone sussurr mi sentir molto triste quando tu non ci sarai pi
1137845 e bella disse a se stesso mentre usciva dal folto del boschetto e questo non si pu negarlo ma avr del sentimento ho paura di no in effetti come la maggior parte degli artisti solo apparenza apparenza senza sincerit non si sacrificherebbe per gli altri pensa solo alla musica e tutti sanno che le arti sono egoiste per bisogna ammettere che ha una bella voce che peccato che tutto questo non significhi niente o comunque non porti nessun beneficio pratico
1137846 premi pi forte piccolo usignolo incit il cespuglio o il giorno si alzer prima che la rosa sia spuntata
1137847 che fortuna incredibile esclam ecco una rosa rossa non ne ho mai vista una uguale in tutta la mia vita e cos bella che sono sicuro che deve avere un lungo nome latino
1137848 hai detto che avresti danzato con me se ti avessi portato una rosa rossa cominci lo studente eccoti la rosa pi rossa del mondo lappunterai vicino al tuo cuore stasera e mentre balleremo ti dir quanto ti amo
1137849 ho paura che non si adatti al mio vestito rispose e inoltre il nipote del ciambellano mi ha mandato dei veri gioielli e tutti sanno che i gioielli valgono molto di pi dei fiori
1137850 maleducato esclam la ragazza sei proprio maleducato e dopo tutto chi sei solo uno studente in verit non credo nemmeno tu abbia fibbie dargento alle scarpe come il nipote del ciambellano
1137851 che cosa sciocca lamore esclam lo studente non vale la met della logica non dimostra niente fa sperare in eventi che non succedono mai e fa credere cose che non sono vere in effetti poco utile mentre in questepoca tutto deve essere utile
1137852 it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all
1137853 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1137854 they said i need to come to a place on sunday morning where i dont experience
1137855 we are the church together another book that looks at interracial churches says whites often say that church should transcend race
1137856 theyd say cant we just get along without talking about race all the time
1137857 people said that if jews greeks africans slaves men and women the huge divides of that time period could come together successfully there must be something to this religion
1137858 everyone understands the rules the lingo the mind set except you
1137859 it was invaluable but i didnt know it at the time
1137860 the fear there was people would think i was chinese
1137861 there would be a flood of all these asians coming in and what would we do then
1137862 if theres not any tension we probably havent done too well
1137863 if one group feels too comfortable weve probably neglected another group
1137864 they didnt want their kids involved in interracial dating and thats not just whites
1137865 as long as the top person the senior pastor is white power sort of resides with whites
1137866 but when that shifts it does something psychologically to people people usually leave
1137867 a black church sermon that could be understood as impassioned might be interpreted as angry and defensive by a white congregation
1137868 taking one dominant identity and forcing everyone to fit into it
1137869 nevermind lah thats the fate of politicians up and down whats important is what you do before you leave
1137870 while our leasing activity and rental rate growth remain steady and in line with expectations our caution for the remainder of 2008 has increased
1137871 weve taken additional steps to further strengthen our balance sheet this year including extending the maturity on 175 million of an unsecured note by five years and closing a 300 million senior unsecured term loan both with very favorable terms and disposing of 89 million of low growth non strategic assets we remain confident that our financial flexibility will benefit us through this softer economic environment and we will continue to focus on executing our business plan to build long term value
1137872 while we completed the lease up of two development projects in chicago and southern california and two projects in mexico we have experienced a slowdown in the leasing of some of our other development assets
1137873 given our caution for the rest of the year we have decided to move the stabilization dates for several projects from 2008 to 2009
1137874 gi altri studi precedenti avevano dimostrato che chi fa una colazione a base di cereali ha livelli di colesterolo e insulina pi bassi
1137875 e i nuovi dati ci suggeriscono che trovare il tempo per fare colazione a lungo andare ha dei concreti benefici per il cuore
1137876 sono necessari altri studi sullimpatto della colazione sul peso corporeo
1137877 ma limportanza di questo studio sta nellaver scoperto che se si inizia la giornata con uno snack a met mattinata e non con una colazione il metabolismo viene gravemente alterato
1137878 questa indagine dimostra che esiste una reale confusione circa le reali cause delle malattie cardiovascolari e il legame tra dieta e salute
1137879 le campagne contro il fumo e lobesit sembrano funzionare ma il fattore di rischio pi importante il colesterolo non ancora riconosciuto da molte persone
1137880 le differenze fra uomo e donna esistono soprattutto in relazione ai sintomi i cosiddetti campanelli di allarme
1137881 il fatto particolarmente preoccupante perch spesso allosservazione dello specialista arrivano donne con infarti mai diagnosticati o gi affette da scompenso cardiaco
1137882 perch per le donne i campanelli dallarme cio i sintomi sono meno avvertiti capita quindi allo specialista di vedere donne gi colpite da infarto che rischiano per questo motivo di andare incontro a scompenso o altri danni vascolari negli uomini il 20 per cento nelle donne il 30 per cento
1137883 negli stati uniti la dottoressa viola vaccarino ha recentemente pubblicato sul new england journal of medicine una ricerca che ha evidenziato che i medici in generale ascoltano meno le descrizioni dei sintomi delle donne continua sirtori e per questo il trattamento farmacologico prescritto loro meno accurato le donne infatti vengono meno frequentemente sottoposte ad angiografia e altri esami per accertare le patologie
1137884 fattori genetici cambiamenti nella distribuzione dei grassi e abitudini comportamentali come lallattamento al seno
1137885 potrebbero esercitare degli effetti negativi sui valori di colesterolo sicuramente tali fattori andranno esaminati con ulteriori studi
1137886 il nostro studio conferma i benefici delle statine nel ridurre il rischio di mortalit totale e cardiovascolare nei pazienti con e senza cardiopatie e inoltre aggiunge prove a favore degli omega 3 nei pazienti cardiopatici
1137887 nei pazienti in terapia con fibrati invece non viene osservata una riduzione di mortalit totale ma un aumento della mortalit per cause non cardiovascolari
1137888 sono quasi 5 milioni le persone che soffrono di diabete o che sono comunque a rischio circa 15 milioni hanno la pressione arteriosa troppo elevata e addirittura 30 milioni sono pi o meno in sovrappeso infine il 34 per cento degli uomini e il 46 per cento delle donne fanno vita sedentaria e non svolgono alcuna attivit fisica durante il tempo libero
1137889 in particolare i pazienti maggiormente esposti al rischio cardiovascolare diabetici cardiopatici ipertesi anziani obesi su consiglio del medico necessitano di una terapia che sia in grado di aumentare il livello di colesterolo hdl in modo da ridurre laccumulo di colesterolo ldl diminuendone il deposito sulle pareti arteriose
1137890 fare attivit fisica aerobica a media intensit usare comunque prudenza e non sottoporsi a sforzi bruschi che potrebbero danneggiare il cuore evitare occasioni di stress liberarsi dellabitudine al fumo di sigaretta non trascurare di comprendere nella dieta il pesce azzurro ricordare di controllare la pressione arteriosa prima di scegliere se andare o meno in montagna valori elevati di pressione arteriosa aumentano il rischio in alta quota sono buone norme che il paziente deve sempre seguire su consiglio del proprio medico curante

1137927 we should not be tolerating a society where the social divide has become so vast we should not have communities with glass walls around them invisibly trapping their residents in a life of dependency

1137929 if we all did things like hang out our clothes we could shut down the nuclear industry
1137930 tap water is unquestionably the most eco friendly source of water unless you live next to a pristine stream it is for this reason that belu recommends tap water as the most environmental choice if you want a drink this might sound odd coming from an organization selling bottled water but if we are to save the planet we must face reality but this issue is not as simple as it sounds there are times when a bottle of water is very convenient there are also many people who have reservations about the quality of tap water for both these reasons not everyone is always going to choose tap water for those occasions when bottled water is going to be chosen anyway belu has created the most eco friendly bottled water on the market we do not import or export our water to reduce the carbon footprint of shipping we are converting to clean energy and offsetting all remaining co2 emissions to become the worlds first carbon neutral bottled water belu has also introduced the uks first compostable bottle made from corn these bottles can first be recycled and then at the end of their life composted back to soil in only 8 weeks a zillion times faster than petrol chemical plastic bottles last but not least belu donates 100 of its profits to fund clean water projects in the uk and around the world as mentioned one primary reason people choose bottled water is their concern about tap water quality the easiest way to increase consumer confidence would be to raise the uks tap water standards to the highest in the world why settle for anything else to encourage the further adoption of tap water in the meantime belu is launching a world class tap water filtration system for use in hotels restaurants businesses and at home for anyone preferring tap water but seeking for a guarantee of purity please email thanks for your interest in this issue we should not have to choose between the environment and our own well being simply to have a drink of water reed paget founder belu belu water
1137931 q will they contaminate the existing recycling streams a as long as bio bottles make up less than 1 of all plastics they wont affect the quality of recycled products in addition roughly 10 of recycling centres in the uk have machines that can sort bio bottles from pet and hdpe bottles with landfill taxes rising we expect the rest to be installing them soon too what will further hasten waste companies to sort bio bottles is if it makes them money belu is helping make this happen by buying back bio bottles to make into cool stuff but we still need to get enough bio bottles into circulation to make it worth their time here we could use your help the more people that choose compostable bottles the more businesses that will use them and the sooner recycling companies will sort them in earnest on this point innocent smoothies is on the verge of launching compostable bottles so why not buy innocent if you are buying a smoothie as with any innovation the bio bottle represents the first step on a journey just as there was no recycling system in place for pet when it was introduced 30 years ago bio bottles are slightly ahead of our time but there is no question that this journey is worth it we have endured over 75 years of toxic plastic pollution and the end is nearly in sight

1137981 because the technology is simpler an evaporative cooler costs about half as much as an air conditioner that will cool the same sized area some california utilities such as also offer rebates up to 300 to electricity customers who install whole house evaporative systems for perspective a quick check of the internet in july 2001 found units capable of cooling 750 square feet that were priced as low as 275 installation costs of swamp coolers are comparable to air conditioning units
1137982 two stage evaporative coolers have been developed that pre cool air before it goes through the moistened pad
1137983 like your refrigerator heat pumps use electricity to move heat from a cool space into a warm making the cool space cooler and the warm space warmer
1137984 switch to fluorescent bulbs which give off much less heat than incandescents dont use any appliances in the house when its hot if you must run the dishwasher do so at night
1137985 you may further leverage nature if you have a layout and weather that permits a cross breeze open the incoming breeze window a little and the outgoing window a lot on the out window place an out facing window fan which will pull the air through the house even if you have only two windows facing the same direction you may get relief by opening both placing an inward fan on one and an outward on the other
1137986 if we all did things like hang out our clothes we could shut down the nuclear industry
1137987 teaching college today is like teaching high school thirty years ago these kids are nowhere near ready for what we used to call higher education
1137988 you know i have a lot of college professors as clients they all say their students are a mess that college is not what it used to be they all just seem so beaten down by it so i was just wondering what your experience was
1137989 just tell me what you want give me the recipe for a good grade and i like more videos in class
1137990 what can we say to our mother to comfort her
1137991 when a mother loses a child rather than think about the future she wont have with the child the true feeling the one to concentrate on is gratitude for the years she had with that child because if the mother has done everything she can to love the child and feed and clothe the child and here he paused for emphasis and educate the child then she has done all she was meant to do for the length of time she was given and wasnt that a wonderful thing to have
1137992 he turned to the right and looked directly into my eyes as he said that
1137993 someone told me and i know for a fact it was
1137994 i remember taking george harrison to meet maharishi in 1993 george had gone to apologize for the bad behaviour of the beatles back in 1969 back then the beatles especially john lennon had insinuated that the maharishi was having an affair with mia farrow
1137995 when george apologised the maharishi said there was nothing to be sorry about he said the beatles were angels on earth with their music and he could never be angry with them george wept
1137996 this speech is probably the most monumental speech since martin luther king as it relates to matters of race
1137997 the rhetorical magic of the speech what made it extraordinary was that it was at once both unequivocal and healing there were no weasel words no bushian platitudes or clintonian verb parsing it was a grand demonstration of the largely unfulfilled promise of obamas candidacy the possibility that given his eloquence and intelligence he will be able to create a new sense of national unity not by smoothing over problems but by confronting them candidly and with civility
1137998 obama offered himself as the man who rises from flames and invites you to rise from your own he took a grievous embarrassment and moved his lesson to the plane of prophecy talk about hope talk about audacity tears came to my eyes i dont think im especially hard hearted but i cannot think of another time when the speech of a presidential candidate watered me up
1137999 and so at 11 oclock am on a tuesday a prominent politician spoke to americans about race
1138000 some scholars have contended that the enigmatic stones surrounded by a ditch and earthen banks in concentric circles more than likely marked a sacred place of healing the idea is at least as old as medieval literature which also includes stories of stonehenge as a memorial to the dead so there could be an element of truth to both hypotheses experts say

1138018 we felt most the moral qualities of ernie pyles work and life but we could not help realizing that his work was in our time an unprecedented aesthetic triumph because of it most of the people of a country felt in the fullest moral and emotional sense something that had never happened to them that they could never have imagined without it a war

1138027 even a dog knows the difference between being kicked and being tripped over
1138028 ernie pyle covered world war ii the way the infantry soldier fought it on the ground and on the move subject to fear filth and the capricious fates that dealt death to one man life to another pyle was a novelty as a war correspondent only rarely did he write about the so called big picture rather pyle focused on the individual combatant how he lived endured by turns battle and boredom and sometimes how he died far from home in a war whose origins he only vaguely understood
1138029 it is an exquisite irony that this journalist became celebrated for celebrating the non celebrated it is further irony that his deeply moving pieces became dis remembered at wars end so did the war for that matter we may be the richest country in material things and possibly the poorest in memory
1138030 he sensed immediately what war poet wilfred owen who died in some other war called chances strange arithmetic
1138031 he knew too that it was neither god nor flag nor mother that impelled a pimply faced kid to risk to lose his life in an obscene adventure
1138032 when they found ernies body on ie an island in the okinanawan chain where the battle was being fought they came across a rough draft of a column that he had with him fragments dead men in such familiar promiscuity that they become monotonous dead men in such monstrous infinity that you come almost to hate them these are the things that you at home need not even try to understand to you at home they are columns of figures
1138033 no man in this war has so well told the story of the american fighting man as american fighting men wanted it told he deserves the gratitude of all his countrymen
1138034 with deep regret the navy announces the death on ie shima island of ernie pyle
1138035 he was killed instantly by japanese machine gun fire while standing beside the regimental commanding officer of headquarters troop seventy seventh division united states army
1138036 mr pyle will live in the hearts of all service men who revered him as a comrade and spokesman more than anyone else he helped america to understand the heroism and sacrifices of her fighting men for that achievement the nation owes him its unending gratitude
1138037 ernie pyle belonged to the millions of soldiers he had made his friends his dispatches reached down into the ranks to draw out the stories of individual soldiers he did not glorify war but he did glorify the nobility the simplicity and heroism of the american fighting man the army deeply mourns his death
1138038 the gis in europe and that means all of us here have lost one of our best and most understanding friends
1138039 i was so impressed with pyles coolness calmness and his deep interest in enlisted men they have lost their best friend

1138063 you know when i said i knew little about love that wasnt true i know a lot about love ive seen it centuries and centuries of it and it was the only thing that made watching your world bearable all those wars pain lies hate it made me want to turn away and never look down again but when i see the way that mankind loves you could search to the furthest reaches of the universe and never find anything more beautiful so yes i know that love is unconditional but i also know that it can be unpredictable unexpected uncontrollable unbearable and strangely easy to mistake for loathing and what im trying to say tristan is i think i love you is this love tristan i never imagined id know it for myself my heart it feels like my chest can barely contain it like its trying to escape because it doesnt belong to me any more it belongs to you and if you wanted it id wish for nothing in exchange no fits no goods no demonstrations of devotion nothing but knowing you loved me too just your heart in exchange for mine
1138064 i often relate to my emotional suffering as though it were a physical pain
1138065 can i imagine a time in the future when these scars and these experiences will dissolve drop away so that i will finally be free this is not actually a condition of freedom im free right now because i can acknowledge that the scars are there because i no longer wish for them to be any different from what they are dont get me wrong i spent a long time wishing that the scars of my life would just go away but the more i wished for this the crazier i felt because the reality is that my scars are part of me like my own hand i needed to learn to acknowledge them and to live with them in peace and harmony

1138069 some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america no to independence from foreign oil
1138070 one man knows we must now drill more in america and rescue our family budgets
1138071 that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
1138072 weve always envisioned the company to be more than a high end niche sports car manufacturer
1138073 its a great way to change the worlds perceptions of evs and to show what electric cars can do but we want to make affordable vehicles in much greater quantities
1138074 climate change is the biggest challenge that mankind has ever faced if we cant change such a simple thing as the cars we drive were going to be in trouble

1138079 because any decision on development has the greatest affect on communities local planning will only be done in agreement with first nations
1138080 it is critical that any development of natural resources in the far north must respect aboriginal and treaty rights while supporting an environmentally sustainable economic future for our people
1138081 and if theres one thing we know for sure its not going to stay that way forever unless we do something its our responsibility as global citizens to get this right and to act now
1138082 wouldnt it be nice if everyone regardless of political preference simply tried to understand what is true and stopped trying to fit evolution into ideologic al pigeonholes
1138083 the question the conference has left unanswered is whether a new paradigm will appear or whether the study of language evolution will simply fall back into the chaos and confusion that once made taboo all inquiry into speech origins
1138084 why and how the problem of universal grammar is hard
1138085 are crucial in understanding many aspects of linguistic structure as well as the processes of language change
1138086 the scientific method begins by seeking functional explanations for their apparent arbitrariness
1138087 the study of cultural evolution from a biological perspective remains in its infancy and we can expect substantial progress in the coming decade
1138088 a general tendency for increased rates of linguistic evolution in fledgling languages perhaps arising from a linguistic founder effect or a desire to establish a distinct social identity
1138089 what the biological sciences can and cannot contribute to ethics
1138090 a man lacking shame can go far in life especially one who feels no need for friends
1138091 if culture was the outcome the revolution itself must have been biological or at least begun that way
1138092 for genetic assimilation to take place this hypothetical persistent aspect of language must also impose consistent invariant demands on neural processes
1138093 we suggest that language does not involve any qualitatively different mechanisms compared to extant apes
1138094 may force a code that can be interpreted incrementally rather than by using one of the many practical codes in engineering in which information is stored in large blocks
1138095 the basic phonentic inventory is transparently related to deployment of the vocal apparatus
1138096 involve the extraction and further processing of discrete elements occurring in complex temporal sequences
1138097 the lexical turn in linguistics focusing on specific lexical items i e words with their associated syntactic and semantic information
1138098 specifically we adopt a construction grammar view of language proposing that individual constructions consisting of words or combinations thereof are among the basic units of selection
1138099 their explanations of fashions e g wearing baseball caps backwards catchphrases memorable tunes engineering methods cultural conventions and institutions e g marriage revenge killings scientific and artistic ideas religious views and so on seem patently to be products of sighted watchmakers i e they are products in part at least of many generations of intelligent designers imitators and critics
1138100 languages that are not limited by the vocal apparatus naturally lexicalize these into non sequential constructions
1138101 far more robust arguments for universal grammar perhaps because the one who gave them wasnt chomsky
1138102 everyone will have to give a little in order for the pieces to fit together
1138103 given such a strong misalignment among individuals why is communication so effective
1138104 elite or domineering group telling the others how or what
1138105 elite or domineering group from the telling the others how or what language they had to speak while in prehistoric times the mixture of language was definitely a common phenomenon and the most important factor in language evolution
1138106 algo evoluiu mas ainda n o se chegou ao ponto ideal
1138107 open air prison with no way in and no way out
1138108 i have the feeling that this discovery is one of those things like robinson crusoe observing a footprint that changes many expectations the dediu ladd paper on the relation between tones and genes calls for a new way of thinking about thinking the nature nurture discussion just took a new turn
1138109 language can adapt to the abilities of the speakers by changing so that it is easier to learn
1138110 sits uneasily with the idea of language as a perfect and economical system
1138111 capacity for language is not fixed and uniform across the species but diverse and dynamic
1138112 my trust in you has been shattered forever by your unfaithfulness
1138113 a priest a rabbi and a minister walked into a bar
1138114 a boy an innocent a na ve lamb walked into a bar
1138115 a natural history of the human mind tracing evolutionary changes in brain and cognition
1138116 all great apes but no monkey species possess a suite of behaviors that include gestures and styles of object manipulations that are distinctive for a given social group community persist from generation to generation and are transmitted horizontally through social learning
1138117 great apes are acutely sensitive to the direction of others gaze
1138118 great apes appear to be able to delay gratification longer than rhesus monkeys
1138119 both cooperation and imitation come more naturally to human children than to young chimpanzees
1138120 human children learn from others mistakes but nonhuman primates do not
1138121 it can represent any object for which it has a term as possessing any property for which it has a term
1138122 there is little archaeological evidence that even our relatively recent hominin ancestor homo erectus was capable of such thought
1138123 neural correlates of early stone age toolmaking technology language and cognition in human evolution
1138124 more or less symmetrical teardrop shaped tool well suited for butchery and other heavy duty cutting tasks
1138125 seems much more demanding than oldowan flaking requiring greater motor skill and practical understanding of stone fracture more elaborate planning and an increased number of special purpose knapping tools and technical operations
1138126 particularly with respect to larger scale phenomena such as metaphor figurative language connotative meaning prosody and discourse comprehension
1138127 heres what i think apple is about to do i reported more than a year ago and repeated in this years predictions that apple would be adding h 264 hardware support to its entire line of computers the chip they are adding comes from ntt in japan and was developed in cooperation with japanese broadcaster nhk the chips began sampling a year ago and should now be available in volume though apple may be paying as much as 50 each for early production
1138128 the ntt chip is not just an h 264 decoder it encodes too which is what makes it so special the last i heard nhk was claiming the chip could compress a 1080p video and audio stream into four megabits per second down from the 20 megabits normally required if we assume apple will apply the same kind of wink wink nudge nudge transcoding to 1080p that theyve already applied to 720p in the apple tv then it is within reason to expect theyll claim to distribute 1080p over itunes in two megabits per second
1138129 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1138130 they said i need to come to a place on sunday morning where i dont experience
1138131 we are the church together another book that looks at interracial churches says whites often say that church should transcend race
1138132 theyd say cant we just get along without talking about race all the time
1138133 people said that if jews greeks africans slaves men and women the huge divides of that time period could come together successfully there must be something to this
1138134 everyone understands the rules the lingo the mind set except you
1138135 it was invaluable but i didnt know it at the time
1138136 the fear there was people would think i was chinese
1138137 there would be a flood of all these asians coming in and what would we do then
1138138 if theres not any tension we probably havent done too well
1138139 if one group feels too comfortable weve probably neglected another group
1138140 they didnt want their kids involved in interracial dating and thats not just whites
1138141 as long as the top person the senior pastor is white power sort of resides with whites
1138142 but when that shifts it does something psychologically to people people usually leave
1138143 a black church sermon that could be understood as impassioned might be interpreted as angry and defensive by a white congregation
1138144 taking one dominant identity and forcing everyone to fit into it
1138145 the papers suggest that the neural circuitry in humans evolved gradually from primate precursors the human language circuits did not appear de novo through a chance mutation or as a spandrel of increased brain size but instead have their basis in modified versions of neural structures shared by related species
1138146 emerging from that process came something quite new interest in neutral topics
1138147 i am new here and i just wanted to say i enjoyed this video very much i dont get the people who are griping about it if you dont like it dont wacth it i am a big fan of david caruso and enjoy everything i find on him so thank you to the maker of this video for making my day
1138148 the st louis north assembly plant has created the model for future plant events for minority suppliers

1138164 weve built up quite sophisticated neoclassical models where theres no entreprener in there just factors of production
1138165 el equipo est bien sobre ponernos de un resultado adverso en los dos partidos habla muy bien del grupo pero hay que estar tranquilos y mantener los pies sobre la tierra porque esto reci n empieza como en todos los arranques del torneo nos falta un poco de ritmo y cosas por mejorar en todas las l neas para mantener una gran regularidad durante los noventa minutos de cada partido
1138166 uno siempre sue a con hacer su primer gol y obviamente el haber colaborado con un gol en la reciente victoria me pone feliz ya que apenas es mi segundo partido en el torneo de este pa s pero tambi n debo reconocer que lo m s importante es que el equipo obtuvo el triunfo y que est colocado en los primeros planos que es lo que m s me interesa creo que mientras todo el plantel juegue bien los goles llegar n y de esa manera cada uno de nosotros como jugadores cumpliremos con el compromiso que tenemos en este club
1138167 estoy listo y en grandes condiciones para ser tomado en cuenta desde un inicio de cada partido pero as ser cuando el t cnico lo decida
1138168 por ahora disfrutamos el triunfo pero desde ma ana que viajemos tendremos en el pensamiento a san luis no s mucho del rival pero por lo poco que lo he visto s de la clase de buenos jugadores que tiene por tal motivo debemos estar atentos todo el tiempo sobre ellos para que nos sorprendan desde los primeros minutos y posteriormente hacer lo que pretendemos
1138169 es agradable que haya una competencia interna por un puesto
1138170 apenas es el inicio de torneo y no veo el caso de hacer movimientos
1138171 evidentemente el inicio de torneo que hemos tenido ha sido bueno durante estas dos fechas nos enfrentamos a buenos equipos que coincide que son de la ciudad de guadalajara contra chivas rescatamos un empate en casa y recientemente frente al atlas el equipo se repuso en dos ocasiones y finalmente sac un buen resultado en un gran partido y de muchos goles
1138172 me preocupar a si no me hubiesen alcanzado los resultados pero el equipo cada vez est m s fortalecido mentalmente no se desespera ni pierde su esquema y eso es lo m s importante nos hemos recuperado de marcadores adversos y eso es lo que habla de la gran personalidad que tiene este equipo
1138173 m s que tomarlo como un problema por determinar qui n inicia en cada juego me es agradable saber que cuento con un gran grupo que de alguna manera hace que haya una competencia interna la cual es fundamental para cumplir con lo objetivos de esta instituci n y que no se base en los logros individuales obviamente que el jugador que no tiene actividad est descontento pero junto con mi cuerpo t cnico hemos hablado con cada uno de ellos para reiterarle que ser n tomados en cuenta en su momento
1138174 hay que vivir el momento despu s del partido del atlas pensamos en nuestro partido contra el san luis m s all de lo resultados y de la gira que vamos a tener en espa a estamos enfocados en nuestros compromisos que tenemos esta semana para irnos tranquilos a nuestra gira por europa
1138175 no acostumbro a comentar o dar mi alienaci n antes de cada partido apenas es la segunda fecha y el grupo est bien preparado para darle continuidad al trabajo que se ha venido realizando creo que si estuvi ramos hablando de la d cima jornada tal vez pensar a en hacer algunos movimientos
1138176 es muy malo tener que ver por la televisi n jugar a la selecci n ol mpica mi voluntad era estar junto con todo el grupo pero el real madrid no me quiso liberar lo lamento mucho
1138177 nos estamos viendo muy fuertes en la delantera con los jugadores que tenemos y esto es muy bueno para el equipo yo espero que continuemos jugando tan bien como hasta ahora en el inicio de la temporada
1138178 en mi gol iba al uno contra uno ante el portero e intent no pensar demasiado en c mo iba a resolver yo estaba muy feliz con mi gol una vez concluido el partido
1138179 darren es un delantero muy bueno y es f cil jugar con l porque es muy r pido el est siempre desmarcado para recibir un pase y espero que este entendimiento contin e
1138180 igualmente ma ana por la tarde le estaremos haciendo un ecosonograma
1138181 sali con una distensi n muscular en la parte posterior del muslo espec ficamente en el tercio medio del m sculo b ceps femoral
1138182 igualmente ma ana por la tarde le estaremos haciendo un ecosonograma para descartar una posibilidad diagn stica que ser a un tir n o rotura miofibrilar parcial grado uno
1138183 s obviamente era riesgoso aparte que ya no le permit a desenvolverse futbol sticamente y decidi l pedir su cambio
1138184 el entrenador es siempre el que decide y nosotros trabajamos para que tenga todas las opciones disponibles y en buena forma
1138185 todos esperamos siempre salir y ayudar si nos toca jugar todos damos lo mejor y as fue el s bado encontramos la forma de darle vuelta al marcador y convertimos dos goles m s con base a trabajo y paciencia ya que nos dimos cuenta que faltaba mucho tiempo para que el duelo terminara y por suerte con el sacrificio anotamos dos goles m s

1138221 ignoring the rules is often a socially trivial matter certainly when it is accepted by the masses but breaking the rules is a very different matter from ignoring the rules breaking the rules takes bravery it requires great courage to stand up in china today and say stop this is wrong i protest and doing that in china is dangerous the lack of those citizens with the courage to stand up and say i protest is today the weakest link in the connection between china and greatness those few who do stand up suffer perils beyond imagination china has its dissidents but they do not have a tradition of dissent and struggle in which to orient themselves at least not a chinese one their idols and role models are also foreigners such as lech walesa aleksandr solzhenitsyn vaclav havel and the dreamer martin luther king brave chinese dissidents are very much a minority and they are almost totally ignored by chinese society there are no parades calling for the freeing of chinas prisoners of conscience how can there be most chinese people are not allowed to know such prisoners exist and of those who do know many simply do not care enough to raise their voice possibly to suffer a similar fate think of william wilberforce who did so much to end slavery at the beginning of the 19th century think of emmeline pankhurst who fought to get women the vote in the early 20th century think of rachel carson whose 1962 book silent spring sparked off the global environmental movement these are people who did not just ignore the rules they broke them and allowed their countries to grow positively and dynamically freer it is not that such people do not exist in china it is that they will not raise their head above the parapet today chinese culture and society stresses conformity and consensus above all else there is conformity in ignoring the rules and conformity in refusing to break them when chinese people feel fear the fear that comes when they see their country is not changing not developing its political liberties then and only then will the charge be led over the parapets and into the firing line

1138233 i f this were the chicago intl festival say then most likely there would be many chicago based musicians on the bill the rijf is a fantastic opportunity to put some of our best local musicians in the spotlight
1138234 contemporary jazz amp r amp b artists such as lee ritenour fourplay bobby caldwell ivan lins patti austin dave grusin brian auger tower of power

1138240 p lease leave the jerry lee lewis shit at home theres no justification for that as he and others fs jr for ex are not showing up at the hipper more revered jazz fests across the land and certainly not in europe
1138241 i would like rijf attendees to stop whining when there are other than mainstream jazz acts at the fest the rijf allows us the opportunity to come together as a community and experience musical art that we may not otherwise be exposed to during the course of the year just like tv there are some 800 channels to choose from if you dont like one channel then change it

1138301 q the absence of black people in any town in the south is an impossibility did the writers deliberatly script only white people for the show
1138302 also you are wrong that there were no blacks in mayberry
1138303 of course theres also flip conroy played by rockne tarkington
1138304 in my opinion not having blacks on the show was just a reflection of the way things were and actually still are in many places
1138305 i dont really think it was the writers sponsors or anybody else that caused the

1138308 for slaves military duty offered a welcome escape from the misery of plantation labor the allure of a promise of freedom also entailed upward mobility dignity prestige and the chance to prove ones manhood and even to receive awards that would impress ones peers as well as white authorities for blacks who had already spent significant time in the new world there were also motives to defend ones homes families and even paternalistic whites
1138309 soldiers fight for different reasons patriotism boredom revenge defense of home career opportunities etc often a combination of these they are still soldiers
1138310 i think that the proposition to make soldiers of the slaves is the most pernicious idea that has been suggested since the war began you cannot make soldiers of slaves or slaves of soldiers the day you make a soldier of them is the beginning of the end of the revolution and if slaves seem good soldiers then our whole theory of slavery is wrong if blacks can be well led well trained and go into battle and show the same courage as whites then the whole theory of slavery is dead the confederacy must be alive
1138311 the day that the army of virginia allows a negro regiment to enter their lines as soldiers they will be degraded ruined and disgraced
1138312 the existence of a negro soldier is totally inconsistent with our political aim and with our social as well as political system we surrender our position whenever we introduce the negro to arms if a negro is fit to be a soldier he is not fit to be a slave and if any large portion of the race is fit for free labour fit to live and to be useful under the competitive system of labour then the whole race is fit for it
1138313 it is reasonable to believe that they slaves desired to have the same opportunities as their euro american neighbors to acquire personal property raise their families and travel freely it is conceivable that for reasons of personal freedom and the future freedom of their progeny many african americans willingly enlisted in the continental and british armies these personal reasons certainly made it possible for them to justify their active defense of a new nation that demonstrated no signs of eliminating the institution which continued to enslave their fellow african americans

1138346 isnt that cute syracuse won 8 games in 1999 can you imagine
1138347 the messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam used to fast until we thought he would never break his fast and he would not fast until we thought he would never fast i never saw the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam fasting for an entire month except in ramadaan and i never saw him fast more than he did in shabaan
1138348 fasting in shabaan is better than fasting in the sacred months i e dhul qadah dhul hijjah muharram and rajab soorah tawbah 9 36 and the best of voluntary fasts are those that are observed in the months closest to ramadaan before or after the status of these fasts is like that of al sunan al rawaatib which are done before and after fard prayers and which make up for any shortfall in the number of obligatory prayers the same applies to fasts observed before and after ramadaan just as al sunan al rawaatib are better than other kinds of voluntary prayers so fasts observed in the months before and after ramadaan are better than fasts at other times
1138349 worship at times of tribulation fitnah is like hijrah migration to me
1138350 the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam did not fast any entire month apart from ramadaan

1138381 i have a choice to step inside the cage to fight but there are a lot of helpless animals that are not given that choice dog fighting is cruel and inhumane and those who engage in it are losers
1138382 dog fighting is animal abuse plain and simple torturing or abusing animals is not cool nor is it a sign of being a real man real fighters stand up for whats right and protect those who are unable to do so

1138401 there are several inaccuracies on twitter we take great care in having authorized people speak on behalf of the company we want to make sure anyone who is speaking for the company is doing so accurately
1138402 we think it amp apos s important that people are transparent and honest about whom they represent
1138403 we think they should be honest about where they are coming from
1138404 i believe we are the first major energy company here on twitter exxon mobile is trying to lead the way in corporate citizenship
1138405 exxon mobil reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 5 million metric tons from 2006 to 2007
1138406 although the valdez spill was tragic it was only 10 million gallons compare that to the 73 million in the nowruz oil field in 1983
1138407 brands should be monitoring the discussion and instances of their keywords in social networks failure to do so results in becoming case studies
1138408 the power has shifted to those that participate so while janet may have achieved momentum by participating further opportunity lies within exxon when theyre ready to come forward

1138410 there is little if any value in live mesh for most enterprise users or others who must live and work in a heterogeneous environment
1138411 targeting developers early on is key theyve certainly learned this in the past
1138412 if you dont get the developers you dont win the platform battle
1138413 if i mesh enable a service does it mean it can be accessed from any mesh compatible device
1138414 if i dont have to do anything extra to make that phone work with a service thats cool
1138415 the it industry didnt speak kilowatts that well and the utility industry wasnt that well versed in geek
1138416 they needed some translation to go that last mile even though there are very smart people in both industries

1138438 statements of mine secretly recorded at a social function last friday and published over the weekend have caused confusion and concern about nationals policy on kiwibank and working for families
1138439 we have worked for several years to find a better way of allowing families to keep their own income
1138440 we opted to retain the existing structure because we were not willing to create uncertainty for families under pressure if we are elected we will work to improve the system for families without reducing entitlements
1138441 with respect to kiwibank i shouldnt have made the comments i made national has had no discussions about kiwibank and has no plans to sell it
1138442 comments i made regarding the complexity of wff have been construed as criticism of john key that is wrong my repeated responses to this question yesterday reflected my determination not to widen the debate not an attempt to criticise john key
1138443 i should have made it clear that i meant no such criticism and im making that clear today
1138444 the electricity commission is calling for proposals to introduce household compact fluorescent lighting programmes nationally it will spend up to 3 million to expand its household lighting efficiency programme across new zealand
1138445 imagine 20years down the road with 4 5 million people dumping these things in there everyday rubbish
1138446 it was something about the little boy that cried wolf finally coming to town with the most important message ever and the towns folk were so used to the little boy trying to be self servingly sensationalist that the important message was ignored
1138447 so much for a proper handling of your bulbs by your local council
1138448 i got your magazine today and nearly cried about a month ago a cfl broke in my kids room somehow it had fallen out of the light fitting and i found it broken on the floor thankfully no one was in the room at the time
1138449 this it not right we cant find anything wrong with you you can be discharged now you shouldnt be doing this
1138450 as teams of officials scour new zealand for some indian pilgrims who have done a runner believing they are entitled to be here the anz announces the loss of nearly 200 jobs to india
1138451 perhaps the anz could attract these missing pilgrims back to the jobs that have been snatched from new zealanders from a foreign owned bank which does not give a damn about us
1138452 the anz has had to set aside funds to cover their sub prime losses and new zealanders will be paying through job losses fees and interest rates
1138453 it is very difficult to assess the claims made because the article confuses elemental mercury with methyl mercury ambient air guidelines with single doses and kilowatts with kilowatt hours
1138454 it is also very hard to see the connection between a pin head sized solid of mercury amalgam and a vapour which is said to contaminate whole houses
1138455 there is such a thing as the public good you know
1138456 linux comes in many flavours somw of them nerdware or hobbyist grade that includes ubuntu
1138457 our company has been on the web since the late 1990s
1138458 we have always maintained and grown our internet presence recognising early on that it was a fantastic mechanism for delivering news and current affairs content
1138459 the recent uptake of high speed broadband in new zealand and around the world has pushed the industry to a tipping point that will change the news publishing industry forever
1138460 at the moment while ordinary newspapers obviously have interactive websites you actually have to remember to go to the site and check for updates
1138461 with tgif the newspaper comes to you in an ordinary pdf format
1138462 weve secured the rights to some of the top news and photo agencies in the world
1138463 that means when you read a story in tgif a hyperlink can take you straight to video of the event in question
1138464 the weather forecasts will always be current because theyre linked through to 24 7 weather bureaux
1138465 if a major news story breaks during our production time we can very easily email out updated versions of the newspaper direct to readers at no extra cost
1138466 in effect tgif will be putting the world at your fingertips saving you an awful lot of browsing time
1138467 for years people have complained about the percieved bias of the traditional news media one of the reasons
1138468 with more than 25 years in the news business we have a depth of knowledge and experience that stretches across the muldoon lange palmer moore bolger shipley and clark years combined thats institutional memory that many current journalists simply dont have
1138469 while advertisers are very important to us in the media and they play a substantial role in boosting awareness of new products we have designed tgif first and foremost to be a newspaper dedicated to the needs of its readers
1138470 to achieve that however we need as many people as possible to subscribe
1138471 the more people who sign up for this first month the stronger the signal you will send to politicians and other media that you want your voice to be heard and your concerns reflected in news coverage
1138472 if you purchase one of the sunday papers from the newsstand not only do you have the cost of travel and your time but itll cost you between 10 and 12 50 a month
1138473 in contrast for 3 tgif is only 1 3 to 1 4 of the cost
1138474 were appealing to everyone reading this to at least try tgif for a month so you can really see what were capable of delivering
1138475 if owen glenn did not provide shipping for tobacco products a competitor would
1138476 should we blame dairy and service station owners for the prevalence of smoking in nz i would not want to let the tobacco companies off that easily
1138477 i still dont know whether i will continue at real madrid
1138478 the negotiations are in hand and will hopefully be settled in a day or two
1138479 i think that we are close to an agreement and that the clubs are on the right track i am close to a move to paris but it is necessary to await a formal agreement between the two clubs
1138480 they will take a bit of beating it will be the usual top four but i cant see anyone getting above them
1138481 he hasnt added to his squad yet and i dont know if he will but the squad last season was the best anyway
1138482 the size and quality in depth in the squad is the difference
1138483 it was a very encouraging night for us in the first half in particular
1138484 i thought we just edged it and their goalkeeper made some very good saves
1138485 if russell does that on saturday ill kill him im glad that he got it out the way in a friendly
1138486 it was a good experience for my players they had eight internationals out there in the first half
1138487 the second half petered out a bit and we gave the ball away a bit too easily when you do that with players of the quality united have it takes you a long time to get it back
1138488 peterborough were the better side in the first half and should have been 2 0 up
1138489 but there were some plus points for us as well
1138490 rafael da silva played the full 90 minutes and was pleasing and his brother fabio played 45 minutes as well
1138491 i was really pleased with their contributions and it will be interesting to see how they get on this season
1138492 i want to play and i think i am strong enough to fight for a regular start
1138493 it cannot continue like last season and it wont do either
1138494 they are one of the top clubs in the world and now they have a coach in jose mourinho who has a lot of charisma
1138495 added to that is the fact that inter is a former club of bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge and mine and for the fans it is also a big hit to have such a game to start the season off with
1138496 there is a saying in italy which says once interista always interista inter has a place in my heart
1138497 it was my first club abroad and i learnt a new language and culture there i became a fan of italy and inter is a special club in italy which means a great deal to its fans
1138498 when karl heinz rummenigge or i go to italy we are always spoken to by inter fans
1138499 i know him from my time as germany manager as he had robert huth with him at chelsea
1138500 i flew to london a few times and we went to eat or have a coffee i think jose mourinho is a fascinating coach who has his own ideas and thoughts
1138501 when he came to the usa with chelsea i had the opportunity of seeing the way he prepares training he really works well and has everything well planned out
1138502 he is a tactician but also a joker and i think that is very important because he emits a lot of joy and enthusiasm
1138503 i am looking forward to seeing how he manages at inter the expectations there like at fc bayern are the highest but he knows that from his chelsea days and this is the next step
1138504 one of the things were looking at for the next update is the creation of a new type of environment for our levels to be built in
1138505 were pretty happy with the way our environments have turned out so far but as we create more and more maps with these achievement packs we want our level designers to have more to work with in terms of giving their settings a unique look
1138506 looks more like a beautiful piece of art than a monitor
1138507 foot plants can be used to spring off the environment from one trick into another
1138508 the xbox 360 version was hitting the 60fps mark most of the time and the gameplay feel was definitely better for it
1138509 on the next food network star adam exhibited a unique combination of quick wit passion for food and an engaging personality
1138510 he earned millions of fans across the country who have let us know that we have a second star in our midst we feel this series is a perfect fit for his talents letting him showcase his brand of humor while he works for food
1138511 it got to the point where we couldnt handle the volume of requests we were getting both internally and from places like espn and our local fox station
1138512 and football was only one of five sports we were shooting we also cover basketball soccer and other sports where there arent any licensing issues so between the need to stream game clips on our site create videos for our coach to review with players put together highlight videos for awards dinners and make footage available to the networks it was time to look for a new editing system
1138513 id always used apple products because theyre just more user friendly
1138514 the functionality of final cut is so much more intuitive than our old system we get a lot of students working here from the annenberg center for communications and the film school since theyre already accustomed to final cut it seemed like an obvious choice plus with our xsan and xserve raid system students really zip through their projects its worked out great
1138515 with the intel macs students really have two computers for the price of one
1138516 im b actually youve answered the phone before havent you are you in paris visiting
1138517 im going around the 18th arrondissement today to look at architecture would you like to come with me
1138518 why are you going about paris with a guidebook you live here in paris dont you
1138519 no i dont live in paris cant stand the place
1138520 and number 7 of this street we have the house of insert name of famous painter picasso braque or renoir etc where he lived from insert year to insert another year note the mural on the top left side of the wall depicting the sculptor insert name of famous sculptor painted in the year insert year
1138521 neither do i i guess it mustve been painted over after this guide was written
1138522 and now we come to street number 45 montmartres first town hall constructed in 1790
1138523 yes it does doesnt it well montmartre was little more than a village at that time you know
1138524 and it was on this very spot outside number 72 that monsieur renault drove the first motorcar
1138525 it says on the sign that its a doctors surgery
1138526 yes it does how curious youd expect that at least theyd have made mention of renault somewhere on the sign it was the first motorcar after all
1138527 you know what im getting a bit suspicious about the accuracy of this guide book it seems to be giving us rather strange historical information about these buildings well anyway on we go
1138528 huh you mean we were looking at the wrong buildings the whole time
1138529 er yes these street numbers are actually for another street entirely this is terribly embarrassing im extremely sorry you must think im awfully stupid
1138530 no i dont think youre stupid i just think its a very good thing you are not strictly speaking a parisian because if you were you would be a disgraceful one
1138531 the contest is really a reflection of what we ultimately want our corporate responsibility report to do and to be
1138532 the sky is gray today healing itself back to blue
1138533 i look out the window and feel like a fool everyone carries on with no ears such motionless supervision a crime
1138534 one day she fell in love with the sadness unlike the man who had given it to her the sadness would stay with her long into the night and never leave if the sadness did leave there would more sadness and that was good
1138535 a faraway voice like a voice underwater he says hello nothing more he hangs up calls back his breath is angry inviting sexual hes distant but intimate saying nothing saying everything
1138536 a companys success is directly tied to its ability to create leaders the companies with the most leaders are the most successful
1138537 there are 2 sure ways to fail the first is you listen to everyone and the second is that you listen to no one
1138538 many receive advice but only the wise profit from it
1138539 mentoring is the process of using invisible keys to unlock the hidden potential in another human being it is not about a leader reproducing him or herself in another person but about helping to maximize the best individual that lives inside the other person
1138540 mentorship is all about a movement not a program programs usually start very big then eventually lose momentum and become very small movements are just the opposite they usually start very small and grow very large
1138541 glenn reminds me of some criminals i have known who didnt accept refusal after a down payment
1138542 henry decided that due to the publicity over the past weekend in respect to mr owen glenn that he should break this policy and inform me that mr owen glenn had donated in 2006 a sum in the order of 100 000 towards the legal costs of the tauranga electoral petition
1138543 energy saving lamps contain a small amount of mercury which makes them operate much more efficiently than incandescent and halogen lamps mercury is toxic to human health and bioaccumulates bioaccumulate the accumulation of a substance such as a toxic chemical in various tissues of a living organism in the environment but the amount inside an individual lamp is not large enough to pose a hazard to users
1138544 the amount is not large enough to pose a hazard to users
1138545 without the mercury the lamp would not produce visible light the average amount of mercury in a cfl is 5 mg with a range of 0 9 to 18 mg
1138546 mercury concentration in the study room air often exceeds the maine ambient air guideline maag of 300 nanograms per cubic meter ng m3 for some period of time with short excursions over 25 000 ng m3 sometimes over 50 000 ng m3 and possibly over 100 000 ng m3 from the breakage of a single compact fluorescent lamp
1138547 the amount inside an individual lamp is not large enough to pose a hazard to users
1138548 the maine ambient air guideline maag of 300 ng m3 is identical to the epa reference concentration rfc which is designed to protect against chronic exposure
1138549 a no effect level the level at which no adverse affects are observed was not identified in these studies
1138550 sensitive populations are of particular concern with mercury exposures for a number of reasons
1138551 neurotoxicants identified in adults may have different and more severe effects in developing organisms
1138552 elderly and unhealthy individuals may already be at comprised health and be more susceptible to mercury effects than a healthy individual for example mercury does kidney damage which could exacerbate an already existing kidney disease
1138553 it is well established that the developing organism may be much more sensitive than the adult to neurotoxic agents
1138554 for example methylmercury exposure can produce devastating effects in the fetus including cerebral palsy blindness deafness and even death while producing no or minimal effects in the mother
1138555 never wash clothing or other items that have come in direct contact with mercury in a washing machine because mercury may contaminate the machine and or pollute sewage clothing that has come into direct contact with mercury should be discarded
1138556 never walk around if your shoes might be contaminated with mercury contaminated clothing can also spread mercury around
1138557 the vacuum will put mercury into the air and increase exposure
1138558 this study identified several potential exposures from the breakage of a cfl the first is the air concentration from the initial break and cleanup the next is the source left in the flooring surface this ongoing emission affects both those using the surface in close contact and sometimes those more distant from the flooring especially when the floor is agitated the final piece is the emissions from the broken lamp debris once cleaned up the three different potential mercury exposures each impact guidance for appropriate handling of a broken cfl
1138559 although following the pre study cleanup guidance produces visibly clean flooring surfaces for both wood and carpets shag and short nap all types of flooring surfaces tested can retain mercury sources even when visibly clean
1138560 this mercury source in the carpeting has particular significance for children rolling around on a floor babies crawling or non mobile infants placed on the floor
1138561 cleaning up a broken cfl by vacuuming up the smaller debris particles in an un vented room can elevate mercury concentrations over the maag in the room and it can linger at these levels for hours vacuuming tends to mix the air within the room such that the one foot and five foot heights are similar immediately after vacuuming a vacuum can become contaminated by mercury such that it cannot be easily decontaminated vacuuming a carpet where a lamp has broken and been visibly cleaned up even weeks after the cleanup can elevate the mercury readings over the maag in an un vented room
1138562 then theres the problem of what to do with the toxic waste
1138563 then theres the problem of what to do with the toxic waste
1138564 our house had a plastic burning smell we searched everywhere for it i thought it was the wiring cause hello hello a cfl had burnt out now i know what it was shame on the govt and shame on consummer mag who sent out a supplementary booklet for recomending them
1138565 if i were president i would make everything free and wear pretty dresses
1138566 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so
1138567 we showed that ade and i have a few nice combinations together
1138568 that is really important for two strikers you always have to work together you always have to look for each other hopefully this is a good start
1138569 i am getting better taking steps every day and i am really happy with how it is going
1138570 it is really important for me to get a good start which is why we are building everything up and we are two weeks on the way now
1138571 i learned a lot in the last two years because i have been injured so much
1138572 i learned what my body can take and what it cant so it was an interesting period for me
1138573 i hope next season will not be so unlucky with injuries
1138574 i just do not want to think about that negative stuff if you think positive you get positive
1138575 flamini was a free agent so he could make this decision alex went but this is football and has been happening for many years
1138576 of course i wanted everyone to stay but this is not how life is
1138577 i am committed to win it and if you look around so is everyone here
1138578 arsenal have to win something every year that is our aim if it is not happening then everyone is really disappointed
1138579 i think any of the top four can win the title
1138580 i am not going to say we are going to win it because you never know they do not know we do not know either
1138581 everybody has his own way of looking at things but i think local coaches are ready for the job
1138582 i thought i had worked well enough under foreign coaches and therefore had to be given the chance to prove myself
1138583 i did the job with all my heart and the outcome clearly showed that i had something in me

1138679 i think its a matter of historical fact now that the nation was misled
1138680 our state government is stealing our money and giving it to corporations
1138681 theres a state constitutional provision that bans gifts to private corporations and a lot of people have felt for a long time that theyre ignoring this provision
1138682 theyre giving our tax money away to everybody i mean ibm bass pro missouri corporation delphi harrison american axle
1138683 if new york doesnt step up and make equity investments like this one these people will be in spain in china in india and texas
1138684 were either going to win the case or were going to rip out a page of the constitution because it doesnt mean anything anymore
1138685 some people may see it as a vain and glorious gesture but the reality is something like this can change the way we think about the relationship between the government and the corporations that take money from the government

1138714 i spoke to president khatami of iran from the aeroplane iran at that point was prepared to be part of this
1138715 my view was always that if you built a strong enough international coalition then it was possible to avoid military action it was even possible actually either to get rid of the regime or change its nature fundamentally if the international community stayed together
1138716 it became more important for the french germans and russians to stop the superpower taking unilateral action than to deal with saddams defiance of the un security council
1138717 he believed that in any event it was important to avoid conflict and i used to keep saying to him look that isnt your job is to just tell us the facts
1138718 chirac didnt say what your guys are saying he said
1138719 i felt that the endgame was rushed i think if the inspections had been allowed to run into the summer then perhaps you would have got a new dynamic among the key players

1138732 its very clear that some time ago say two or three years ago and keep in mind that back then we were hearing rumors that intel was looking at ati or nvidia as possible acquisitions but back then the decision was clearly made to develop this expertise in house
1138733 if im going to a poetry reading or if theres a book launch ill bring it along its such a talking point its a wonderful thing to be able to hand it around to see people handling it and talking about it
1138734 its historic its a first but i really hope that it will happen again

1138740 all will vanish though you remain all wear out like a garment
1138741 then i saw a great white throne and the one who was sitting on it in his presence earth and sky vanished leaving no trace
1138742 now these from what i understand mean that the earth will stay in its position forever a reference to the geocentric model which is believed to be the view at the time

1138754 it can be poor or inadequate diet that may lead to obesity there is definitely a link between low income households and rising levels of obesity in adults and children
1138755 we reduced the status of food from something which was cultural to something which was industrial and connected with fuel for our bodies instead of being one of the centres of cultural focus of the household we simply stuff food into ourselves in front of the television those symptoms need to be reversed
1138756 i think there are millions of people who intuitively know that food security is an issue and they are yearning to be more connected with the story behind their food and to rebuild it as a cultural event in their lives
1138757 the development of a secure resilient food plan for this country is one of the most pressing issues as we go into the 21st century we dont have much time it seems to me that this needs to be an effort on the scale of a war emergency and that the most important action you can take is your own we cant afford to wait for governments here there are some things that only government can do but if the change comes from the ground up that will be the most reliable resilient of changes

1138764 lets make it education based i think every black person in america should be able to go to college for free i think they should have eight years to go after their bachelors masters whatever they can get in those 8 years and the reason why i say 8 is that some of those people are gonna be single parents for example and so i think they should have twice the amount of time the average kid in college takes and for those people thats too old or already got a degree they should get a tax break for a certain amount of years
1138765 less affluent whites have not moved away from the democratic party and that class divisions have not declined in american politics

1138767 if workers in the export processing zones had the freedom to bargain for their rights without living in fear of either a government crackdown or immediate factory flight the need for private codes and independent monitors would virtually disappear in countries like the philippines and indonesia governments would enforce these standards and their own laws or fear the economic repercussions but then this type of rigid regulation is exactly what the corporate sector has so aggressively fought since free trade was introduced by yanking the teeth out of the uns declarations and treaties and by steadfastly opposing all proposals to link trade deals to enforceable labor and environmental codes
1138768 we want to warmly invite people from the local community to come down and see for themselves what the camp is all about

1138781 which of you desiring to build a tower does not first sit down and count the cost whether he has enough to complete it otherwise when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish all who see it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what king going out to encounter another king in war will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand and if not while the other is yet a great way off he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace so therefore any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple
1138782 the purpose of saint albans episcopal church is to provide a joyous loving caring community of christian worship and fellowship that makes christ known through active response to the gospel for the spreading of gods kingdom on earth as it is in heaven
1138783 i am not leading any group or organizing any movement to leave the episcopal church i regret that it is necessary for me to keep saying this but i am working diligently to carve out a place for us to stand in this church a place where we can remain with respect and dignity and where we can prosper and grow as traditional orthodox episcopalians we have much to offer and we must be courageous and firm in upholding apostolic faith and order
1138784 i want to say again that i am not leading a secret movement out of the episcopal church i am working to carve out a place to stand i will do whatever it takes to defend this diocese from revisionism heresy and factionalism
1138785 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1138786 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1138787 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1138788 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1138789 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1138790 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1138791 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1138792 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1138793 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1138794 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter
1138795 sticks and stones will break my bones but words will gt childrens personality features unchanged by short term video play
1138796 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent
1138797 over time the percentage of people who have these conflicts will diminish
1138798 a lot of it will have to do with how much energy the fda is willing to expend to find people who dont have a conflict of interest
1138799 the fda has consistently used a very low standard for granting waivers and there is no evidence that this will change
1138800 by making the standard for waivers more stringent and improving the voting system the fda is moving closer toward ensuring the only interest taken into account during these advisory panels is that of the american people
1138801 simultaneous voting avoids voting momentum in which some voters may be influenced even subconsciously by the votes of those who precede them
1138802 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
1138803 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
1138804 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1138805 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
1138806 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
1138807 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
1138808 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
1138809 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
1138810 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1138811 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1138812 we will have one soldier for every 10 municipalities doing nothing except going to the bar with a policeman its a joke and to cap it all its only a provisional measure
1138813 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1138814 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1138815 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today
1138816 as it cools it crosses thresholds this is one when antarctica became permanently frozen and locked up
1138817 because if human beings are unfortunate enough to push climate over one of these thresholds it could be a total catastrophe
1138818 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent
1138819 over time the percentage of people who have these conflicts will diminish
1138820 a lot of it will have to do with how much energy the fda is willing to expend to find people who dont have a conflict of interest
1138821 the fda has consistently used a very low standard for granting waivers and there is no evidence that this will change
1138822 by making the standard for waivers more stringent and improving the voting system the fda is moving closer toward ensuring the only interest taken into account during these advisory panels is that of the american people
1138823 simultaneous voting avoids voting momentum in which some voters may be influenced even subconsciously by the votes of those who precede them
1138824 i dont really know what a grammy means anymore but i know what an eisner means
1138825 the book just assumes that youve read the previous 200 issues of continuity that never actually happened

1138827 were all willing to let go until the actual moment we have to let go
1138828 you gotta remember in the entire history of the universe youre the only you that has ever existed and ever will exist
1138829 theres nobody in existence who is you and no one can ever see the world the way you see it and can tell the rest of us how it looks and it might be so different and so beautiful that it changes everything
1138830 everything you do is like putting out signals and the people who receive them and who send signals back those are the people you want to talk to
1138831 we dont even eat haggis in scotland are you nuts
1138832 during february 2007 palm acquired the assets of two sole proprietorships focused on mobile computing and media devices one a developer of user interface environments and the other a developer of email software applications
1138833 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
1138834 70 80 of the potential gains that could be obtained
1138835 its aggravating it just makes you mad you do that much work and they just squander it
1138836 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy

1138867 i once found in a party store a baseball cap with a plastic turd affixed to its top and the words
1138868 everyone should wake up smell the coffee and form a united front to take a stand against those chiefly responsible for this economic quagmire of not enough jobs gutted safety nets unaffordable energy and fuel costs and runaway prescription drugs medical costs
1138869 this bad news just in not only do you have to buy your way into the american middle class through forceful consumption of the lifestyle but you have to buy your way out of it
1138870 take away americas wal mart junk and cheap electronics and what you have left is a mindless primitive tribe and a gaggle of bullshit artists pretending to lead them
1138871 how did you come under the impression that tax dollars will not pay the fees for people to have these procedures
1138872 what do you think senator clinton means when she insists on universal coverage automatic enrollment and wage garnishment for reluctant individuals for the purpose of paying for universal health care
1138873 i imagine that you will insist that the ones who created the jobs in the first place are those cruel and punitive patriarchs who now are making off with the loot who precisely is responsible for this mess
1138874 since you seem to think that socialists progressives in particular

1138878 through all of her years in washington clinton has been an active participant in conservative bible study and prayer circles that are part of a secretive capitol hill group known as the
1138879 a unique presence in washington a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide to anyone regardless of party or faith who wants to deepen his or her relationship with god
1138880 governmental system led by a dictator having complete power forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism regimenting all industry commerce etc and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism
1138881 the familys most visible activity is its blandly innocuous national prayer breakfast held every february in washington
1138882 in fact clintons god talk is more complicated and more deeply rooted than either fans or foes would have it a revelation not just of her determination to out jesus the gop but of the powerful religious strand in her own politics
1138883 these days clinton has graduated from the political wives group into what may be coes most elite cell the weekly senate prayer breakfast
1138884 but if you feel coburn has a point in proposing the death penalty for abortion providers or that inhofe makes a fair case for why
1138885 its like conversing with a random person on the street only to notice about 5 minutes in that the persons fingernails are filthy their cuffs are worn and their hair is matted
1138886 i guess politics can bring out the insanity in people
1138887 if obama has questionable spriritual advisors then we need to examine all of his other advisors we cannot afford to have questionable individuals in the white house or even second in command
1138888 yahoo was very diligent in evaluating traffic data analysis and speed estimation
1138889 the extension of trafficcasts relationship with yahoo brings critical real time traffic information to yahoo maps users and validates the strength and quality of our data

1138925 sadly however ive long since given up expecting middle aged white feminists to give a damn about subordination of gender noncomforming men and boys living through the 1970s apparently has rendered the entire class hopelessly self absorbed
1138926 hes gonna change the way politics is delivered in america
1138927 do we really need another white guy considering the past history of the others
1138928 oh sure i know all about the civil rights movement
1138929 there was a pray in at a chevron station in san francisco on friday led by a minister asking god for cheaper gas
1138930 we own the government we pay for it and now it better do something for us
1138931 well its like a fellow who has a certain amount of money and doesnt know where the next batch is coming from he can spend it all immediately or spend it slowly depends what kind of drama you like i guess
1138932 in that case we dont need to release any of that locked up oil youve been talking about
1138933 far be it from me to make the revolutionary suggestion that babies are more important than profits
1138934 my husband and i were discussing the need to try funding the poor and see how it trickles to the rich
1138935 yeah babies are more important thats why over 1 1 million women kill one each year
1138936 my husband and i were discussing the need to try funding the poor and see how it trickles to the rich
1138937 we saw a need for a change in the trickle down theory citing how rather than help grow the economy feeding money and tax breaks to the rich helps to grow the profits more people have lost jobs their ability to be consumers in the name of profits than for any other reason
1138938 no one seems to know how much profit is enough and those with the power and money seem to find this a game of finding the tipping point when they have too much profit so far none of the wealthy have decided that one can be too wealthy
1138939 ive been reading about the homeless the poor the drugged out the death of our young stars due to drugs and desperation what a sad statement that some compassion some reason some investment some caring could turn that around
1138940 i think as a country we have reached that tipping point where profit has turned into a detriment for us all the wealthy are still floating in that beaker of gradually heating water and havent realized that theyre cooking their own goose by contributing to the downfall of the middle class
1138941 ive been reading about the homeless the poor the drugged out the death of our young stars due to drugs and desperation
1138942 far be it from me to make the revolutionary suggestion that babies are more important than profits
1138943 so what to conclude is our democracy a myth carefully spun and manipulated the velvet glove of an iron fisted growing police state to keep hold of an increasingly restive worker population are workers simply innocents in this or is there some dysfunctional co enabling relationship of entangled abuse going on
1138944 these persons earn a living wage in exchange for unskilled manual labor
1138945 americas richest 25 percent of taxpayers paid about 86 percent of all federal income taxes in 2005 despite earning only 67 percent of the nations income the highest earning 1 percent alone those earning more than 364 657 paid a staggering 39 4 percent of all federal income taxes despite earning just 21 percent of the nations income that means the top 1 percent of tax returns paid about the same amount of federal income tax as the bottom 95 percent of tax returns combined
1138946 this years numbers show that both the income share earned by the top 1 percent of tax returns and the tax share paid by that top 1 percent have once again reached all time highs in 2006 the top 1 percent of tax returns paid 39 9 percent of all federal individual income taxes and earned 22 1 percent of adjusted gross income both are significantly higher than 2004 when the top 1 percent earned 19 percent of adjusted gross income agi and paid 36 9 percent of federal individual income taxes
1138947 us president george w bush plans to attend church while in china for the opening of the olympic games next month and will speak about freedom of religion a top aide said wednesday
1138948 when he goes to church on sunday august 10 he will make a statement afterwards in which he discusses his view on religious freedom in china
1138949 you can deliver the message of freedom without politicizing the events of the game
1138950 the president will have diplomatic meetings with the chinese leadership that are separate from the games and in those meetings with the chinese leaders he will of course bring up these issues
1138951 i would remind you that falun gong is an evil fake religion which has been banned by the chinese government
1138952 so what everyone knows bush is a world class fleaweight and a very lame duck to boot

1138978 i love to feel super feminine i love dresses and skirts and dislike jeans i think what makes a woman sexy is confidence
1138979 this country really needs a new president this country is so messed up its such a joke and its quite upsetting frankly how hypocritical this country has become its ok for children to see people killed by guns spreading a little love right now would be a good idea she is being a little sexy but they are not provocative
1138980 she was followed by her husband ben then matt damon the men gave serious political speeches on how the country needs change
1138981 they were all in great moods and very friendly to everyone

1139073 towards the end of 1995 i woke up one day to find id become a sex symbol
1139074 john prescott unlike tony blair has never won any plaudits for his smooth good looks and photogenic charm until now for labours deputy leader and former merchant seaman now finds himself cast in the unlikely role of a sex symbol in a political kiss a new poem published in the latest edition of poetry review the quarterly magazine of the poetry society fleur adcock 61 the new zealand born poet describes a sexual fantasy in which she dreams of kissing the tough talking face of new labour
1139075 ms adcock right who is published by oxford university press is described as one of the most popular poets in britain in the latest edition of contemporary poets the poetry worlds bible
1139076 the times had published on its front page a poem by a poet id never heard of fleur adcock shed had a fantasy of sleeping with me or something daft like that all about we were leaning avidly forward lips out thrust certain protuberances under our clothing brushing each others fronts i didnt know what she was on about i had to look up protuberances in the dictionary all the papers followed it up melanie mcdonagh in the evening standard said shed had lunch with me and tony blair but as far as fanciability goes mr prescott is well ahead of the leader the daily express carried a feature called the strange allure of thumper prescott and the mail examined the reasons why prescott is attractive to women the times even sent a reporter valerie grove with me all the way to brussels where i was going to a socialist international meeting just to ask me about it
1139077 then bloody michael heseltine tory deputy prime minister at the time read out the whole poem in the house of commons it got more coverage than my speech in the budget debate which id been slaving over i suppose it was funny and probably meant affectionately but at the time i was so busy with serious things that i suspected they were all just taking the piss
1139078 sir in the dream i was strangling fleur adcock or about to strangle her my fingers had locked and i was leaning avidly forward lips smiling severe intemperance under my calm exterior giving me added strength when john prescott saw us and i woke up in fact ive never strangled a poet but i will if they go on churning out this rubbish in the name of poetry the good old fashioned kind that rhymes and scans but theyre not going to change are they

1139082 there were many friendly competitions to see which team could cover the most houses and two teams reached 150 houses on day three

1139085 three weeks ago i got bitten by a spider and had to be rushed into emergency
1139086 i couldnt walk on my foot for two days it was poisonous and i had a really bad fever that night i woke up and couldnt stand on the foot by the morning it was like a balloon and i had a red line all the way up the inside of my leg
1139087 im the type of person that if you say i cant do this then it makes me more determined
1139088 but aside from what happened four years ago its just been one nightmare after another when each one comes it hits you like a punch in the stomach and youre down on the floor but fighting it gives you a bit of energy as well
1139089 i was in really good shape and suddenly it all dropped on me two weeks before
1139090 this time i think ive had the worst of the stress
1139091 i dont think youre getting it its not a decision is it i dont even want to talk about it im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run thats it that has already been decided
1139092 i wouldnt be here if i didnt think i was in good enough shape
1139093 the crime scene has been degrading every day this has been going on
1139094 as with any murder it is important to get there as soon as possible however in the end we were lucky to have got british detectives out there in a week it was looking like we would not provide police assistance where the death penalty was an issue
1139095 we thought it was important to be involved as the local police must be under huge pressure to sort this out and reassure tourists

1139103 i sat down with peter for a long chat yesterday afternoon and i am 100 per cent confident that we can work together
1139104 i wouldnt be sat here now if that wasnt the case
1139105 thats all we want were not asking speaker pelosi to pass it put it on the floor and let the peoples house work its will were going to win were going to win and she knows that and thats why she wont bring it to the floor of the house her energy policy may work for the people who live in san francisco but it doesnt work for my constituents out here in ohio it doesnt work for most people in america and at the end of the day her position is unsustainable and she knows it her members know it but the only way were ever going to bring her to heel and allow a vote is for us to continue to put pressure on her and so its 25 members we had in congress today led by tom price and mike pence its members all over the country doing their townhall meetings doing their rotary clubs theyre all talking about it and were going to keep talking about it until we get our vote
1139106 sean were just taking the fight to them we had about 25 members on the floor today and well have members every day there every day for the foreseeable future trying to let our constituents speak you know we get elected to congress and the american people expect us to represent their will and here weve got about 49 percent of the american people that we support that we represent and theyre being shut out of this process

1139113 why not bite the bullet and establish patrol zones in the sheriffs office that are little villages with their own little command structure put a patrol commander out there put a staffing out there and theyll stay out there 24 hours a day

1139194 in a challenging market investment in the clean tech sector remains strong because these companies provide cross sector solutions to economic and environmental challenges
1139195 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1139196 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1139197 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1139198 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1139199 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1139200 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1139201 thats old uncle aunt insert name talking out of his her head again
1139202 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
1139203 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
1139204 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1139205 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1139206 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1139207 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1139208 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1139209 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1139210 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1139211 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1139212 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1139213 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1139214 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1139215 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1139216 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1139217 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1139218 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1139219 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1139220 in the muslim school the teacher wrote to tell mother i made faces during koranic studies
1139221 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1139222 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1139223 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1139224 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1139225 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1139226 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1139227 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1139228 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1139229 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1139230 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1139231 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1139232 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1139233 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1139234 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1139235 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1139236 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
1139237 a nonpartisan nonprofit consumer advocate for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in u s politics
1139238 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1139239 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1139240 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1139241 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1139242 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1139243 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1139244 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1139245 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1139246 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1139247 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1139248 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1139249 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1139250 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1139251 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1139252 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1139253 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1139254 you dont have to reinvent the wheel heres the wheel
1139255 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1139256 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1139257 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1139258 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1139259 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1139260 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1139261 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1139262 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1139263 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1139264 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1139265 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1139266 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1139267 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1139268 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1139269 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1139270 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1139271 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1139272 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
1139273 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1139274 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
1139275 in the past men were more gallant and protective they used to arrest the harasser and punish him by shaving his head but things are different now
1139276 our campaign is directed to a passive society and to each man who thinks that nobody would stop him if he harassed a woman on the street we want to tell the harasser to respect himself and that he will find a man to stand up to him on the street
1139277 we tell them that they should not provoke men with their clothes or conduct on the street in the meantime we dont want to put the blame on girls clothes we tell them wear whatever you wish but just try to be moderate
1139278 that was a month ago i felt very insecure and this pushed me hard to join the campaign
1139279 i used to hear about harassment but thought that it only happened to non veiled girls i never thought it could happen to me
1139280 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
1139281 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
1139282 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
1139283 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1139284 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1139285 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1139286 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1139287 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1139288 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1139289 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1139290 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1139291 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1139292 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1139293 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1139294 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1139295 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1139296 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1139297 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1139298 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1139299 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1139300 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1139301 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1139302 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1139303 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1139304 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1139305 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1139306 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1139307 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1139308 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1139309 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1139310 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1139311 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1139312 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
1139313 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
1139314 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1139315 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1139316 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1139317 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1139318 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1139319 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1139320 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1139321 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1139322 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1139323 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1139324 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1139325 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1139326 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1139327 i went to sign into the accounts and they said the password had been changed
1139328 i had an idea who had done it but i dont know exactly how they did it
1139329 it was quite a big deal to me i lost all my e mails and quite a lot of private stuff on the bebo page
1139330 if it happens to anyone they should let the police know so things can be done about it and people will be aware there are consequences
1139331 i think its quite common and people wont know who did it i know a few people who have had it happen
1139332 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1139333 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1139334 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1139335 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1139336 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1139337 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1139338 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1139339 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1139340 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1139341 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1139342 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1139343 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1139344 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1139345 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1139346 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1139347 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1139348 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1139349 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1139350 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
1139351 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
1139352 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1139353 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
1139354 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
1139355 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
1139356 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
1139357 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1139358 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
1139359 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1139360 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1139361 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1139362 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1139363 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1139364 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1139365 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1139366 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1139367 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1139368 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1139369 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1139370 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1139371 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1139372 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1139373 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1139374 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1139375 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1139376 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1139377 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1139378 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1139379 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1139380 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1139381 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1139382 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1139383 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1139384 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1139385 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1139386 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1139387 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1139388 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1139389 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1139390 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1139391 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1139392 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1139393 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1139394 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1139395 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1139396 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1139397 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1139398 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1139399 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1139400 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1139401 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1139402 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1139403 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
1139404 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
1139405 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1139406 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1139407 we will approach calcutta high court for adequate protection to carry out business
1139408 they do not have the licence this is illegal the board will write to agri marketing minister mortaza hossain to take action
1139409 i will give him chatterjee 10 days to prove what he said if he cant i will take legal action against him
1139410 reliance has got no licence but im not too sure about keventer i have told the regulated market committee of north 24 parganas to check
1139411 there is no medical evidence on record to say that he will be handicapped after birth
1139412 the petitioners have not made out that this ladys case is exceptional for us to use discretionary powers
1139413 it is the job of the legislature to help you alter the provision we cannot legislate the provision
1139414 the court viewed the changed stand of the doctors not as a turnaround but as a correction of medical opinion
1139415 were sort of the uninsured doctor capital of the world
1139416 if hes doing his job as a returner thats what he was brought here to do
1139417 so whatever else we get that stuff is gravy i think with the juice that hes got when coach jon gruden goes back to his little laboratory hell come up with some creative ways to get him the ball
1139418 i have to make sure i know everything in the playbook
1139419 but for me its a little different because i know that coach gruden is going to spot play me i think there may be some trick plays some decoy routes that kind of stuff
1139420 all i can say is that he goes inside in walk throughs and gets a lot of reps but it is going to take some time before he can really let it loose
1139421 so i have to learn when i see a cornerback pressed up on me is he going to bail or just press me are they going to be in man or what
1139422 thats the biggest thing for me because after that your athletic ability takes over

1139493 the university and the school of law are welcoming and inclusive educational communities
1139494 i was appalled to see almost the entire issue authored by a very narrow biased and distorted view of the law

1139500 its fair to say they were disappointed with the submissions they received they were looking for a broad range of perspectives not just one or the other
1139501 it wasnt supposed to be an issue about gay marriage

1139629 this specification might have certain additional requirements on character encodings image formats audio formats and video formats in the respective sections
1139630 it would be helpful for interoperability if all browsers could support the same codecs however there are no known codecs that satisfy all the current players we need a codec that is known to not require per unit or per distributor licensing that is compatible with the open source development model that is of sufficient quality as to be usable and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large companies

1139651 last weekend i was with buyers who were shopping in the 2 4m range in incline village they picked the properties that they wanted to see from viewing online they also eliminated potential properties based on their online selections these buyers made a comment about one of lexi cerretis chase incline videos they preferred the video more so than the house the interesting note was that they complimented lexi and were very comfortable with pointing out what looked better on video than live so would like to hear who is using affordable quality video and are your buyers responding more so than to the quality virtual tours
1139652 this is going to be one of those things that i say something in an interview and it gets fed back to him and im on his shithead list for awhile on that until he needs me to do something else there but i think that thats my general opinion hes not a gamer
1139653 its difficult to ask somebody to get behind something they dont really believe in
1139654 i mean obviously he believes in the music and the and that whole side of things and the media side of things and he gets it and he pushes it and they do wonderful things with that but hes not a gamer thats just the bottom line about it
1139655 there are structural reasons why its not going to kill the in there but it certainly should be in there in the running there as a device that you can get modern quality games for something and i think its a great platform for content and new talent on there
1139656 our sales may have grown beyond expectations but there are still a lot of people who have never played videogames i think there are still many new kinds of games that we can offer to pique the interest of people whom we havent managed to attract yet
1139657 after we complete our mission in developed countries then well have to start thinking about how to make our products appealing in developing countries well have a whole new dimension of issues to tackle like pricing quantity availability and regional adaptation were not going to meet our goals that easily
1139658 most of the ideas for accessories that we had initially come up with are out now we might think up some more and we might make them if we do but we dont have any plans to release a whole lot more
1139659 we havent announced the price yet but the cost of making the wii motion plus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable
1139660 i think were doing significantly better than other devices that offer similar services were trying constantly to think of ways that the ds could be used more often in everyday life services we can offer that will make people want to take their ds with them everywhere we need to convince all kinds of customers that they should own a ds
1139661 this agreement is one of our largest new contracts to date
1139662 this project is particularly important as it will further enhance our presence in regions outside of the mainstream developed solar markets in europe we plan to continue to geographically diversify our business to these and other regions in the coming years
1139663 we chose solfocus cpv arrays as part of the isfoc project because we believed their non imaging optical design would provide efficient and reliable systems
1139664 we had confidence that they would be able to meet not just the design challenges but the manufacturing challenges for volume deployment as well we could not be more pleased with the results
1139665 completing this first stage of the isfoc project marks a major milestone for solfocus and for concentrator photovoltaics in general on our way toward achieving grid parity for renewable energy
1139666 working with the isfoc team in this collaborative project of commercial deployment and scale we are proud to deliver on the immense promise and potential that cpv holds in scaling to meet the worlds energy needs
1139667 material that contains drug use and sexual violence related to incentives and rewards is refused classification
1139668 our first generation 14 7 percent efficiency day4 mc module which has been in commercial production since 2006 already places us among the industrys highest performing multi crystalline products
1139669 with the second generation of our proprietary solar cell designs we are taking a major step towards making solar energy cost competitive with conventional sources of electrical power generation
1139670 suntech has an excellent reputation for delivering premium quality high power output solar modules and we are pleased to enter this partnership with them
1139671 renewable energy solutions will no doubt play an increasingly important role in the total energy mix and enel si is committed to supporting broader adoption of these technologies
1139672 i think the reality is that we will win hands down if we convert the ps2 owners to ps3 when we look at the total available market we salivate at the notion of converting our existing ps2 universe
1139673 every million units we drop into the ps2 is an annuity thats going to pay out later on for ps3 upgrades and weve got some interesting ideas on how to reach out to those ps2 owners in the us and convert them up
1139674 i think the notion of that controller is a non trivial point that youve brought up that control and that familiarity is like comfort food from my perspective we lead we dont follow
1139675 and as a brand nintendos got their thing and were not trying to get the senior citizen group to get into gaming were looking to convert the ps2 owners and the tens of millions of installed base that were playing dvds and playing games on their ps2 to now play blu ray movies and blu ray games with their ps3
1139676 we would look at technology that helped enable that as oppose to trying to iterate or be derivative off of somebody elses vision
1139677 ten years it goes back to our mantra of ten years technology thats associated with the playstation has to have future proof qualities to it
1139678 solyndras panels are highly innovative and offer unique design features that differentiate them from conventional panels
1139679 we are very pleased to sign this agreement with trina solar the new contract adds products to our portfolio that becomes day by day larger and more diversified
1139680 we have provided critical materials for semiconductor and thin film solar applications for more than twenty five years
1139681 we believe that thin film solar cell production particularly products that can support building integrated photovoltaics bipv is poised for significant expansion this financing will help enable us to construct a state of the art manufacturing facility to meet growing demand for thin film energy technologies
1139682 materials innovation is critical to enabling new capabilities in semiconductor device manufacturing
1139683 our financing of voltaix is part of intel capitals manufacturing strategy to foster innovation around integrated circuit manufacturing and complementary cleantech areas such as thin film photovoltaics
1139684 the technology in its current stage is a wet state what i am doing is working on the solid state version it is wet chemistry basically but i have found a way to make it solid state
1139685 right now it is more screen printing but it will develop at some stage into a sprayable technology it will be applied very much like paint
1139686 from our years of experience in the pv module industry we recognize the importance of having advanced equipment in our line to produce high quality pv modules to compete globally
1139687 we have developed a beneficial relationship with spire and hope to continue using their high quality products to help us achieve our goals
1139688 pv crystalox solar is well recognized for its expertise in the production of silicon wafers and we are very pleased to initiate this relationship
1139689 aside from silicon many of suntechs key equipment and materials originate in europe including pv cell and module manufacturing equipment module backsheets and adhesives this global sourcing strategy is reflective of our complete commitment to quality and supports our ability to deliver premium quality solar products

1139705 benjamin graham and david l dodd in the 1940 edition of their seminal volume security analysis held that the acid test of a bond or a mortgage issuer is its ability to discharge its financial obligations under conditions of depression rather than prosperity todays mortgage market cant seem to weather prosperity
1139706 everyone was going gaga over them my farmers were trying to grow them and wed walk out in the field and just see horticultural garbage
1139707 every time it rained they would crack open or turn into water bags they burned in the sun or developed fungus you could taste
1139708 it was painful to watch and the yields were a nightmare
1139709 wild oats is the only existing company that has the brand and number of stores to be a meaningful springboard for another player to get into this space eliminating them means eliminating this threat forever or almost forever
1139710 may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly
1139711 focus on high quality perishables specialty and natural organic produce prepared foods meat fish and bakery goods generally have high levels of customer services generally target affluent and well educated customers and are mission driven with an emphasis on social and environmental responsibility
1139712 and so forth and of course any opinion by an economist is subject to scathing criticism by another economist so the decision and dissent are filling with polite academic cross invectives
1139713 so were talking about solar panel installers home weather stripping specialists but were also talking about existing jobs such as welders and sheet metal workers engineers truck drivers
1139714 i was photographing hippos at a waterhole in kruger national park south africa when it happened for more info about that day read my story of the best day ever

1139725 i have several problems with this interview but none of them have anything to do tracie or moe the most glaring of all the errors is simple they did not come to the show to defend their personal beliefs also they are not role models simple because they are in the public eye
1139726 it is also glaringly obvious that only an idiot put themselves in an unsafe sexual situation
1139727 if tracie and moe had known that the interview would actually be more of a debate discussion forum im certain they would have come with preparation and sobriety
1139728 hes moved on to someone nine years younger with a less threatening job education than you
1139729 i dont appropriate black culture as an ironic joke while being a rock only fan
1139730 date rape has swelled into a catastrophic cosmic event like an asteroid threatening the earth in a 50s science fiction film
1139731 and now that im through with that i can get back to talkin bout fuckin
1139732 and if we are truly to be independent creatures we need to learn how to deal with our socio sexual interactions with men without having to go running to a third party all the time to handle shit for us
1139733 oooh yeah youre so wet did you come already i thought so
1139734 or right youre doing that girls night out were sad and single thing

1139738 yes you know sexism i experience it all the time but fuck it i dont care
1139739 im a white middle class feminist and i think that the white middle class feminists need to look out for themselves and stop worrying about other groups
1139740 we were basically driving the media when we came here
1139741 basically i drove the media and i was driven by my editor and my editor had been raped by a duke lacrosse player
1139742 and the thing that didnt occur to me it that those two guys they didnt really need to rape a stripper they could rape whatever sorority girl they wanted
1139743 seriously i know you didnt have sex with michelle why did you think it was ok after i said no 11 times
1139744 i just didnt think you thought sex was a big deal
1139745 oh you should know that you did the wrong thing
1139746 oh this situations not right for me and this isnt right for me and this lifestyles not ok for me
1139747 when we were in college we used to fuck guys to help us move the night before moving we would go out and get drunk and then wed fuck guys and then the next morning wed be like oh were moving and we just fucked you and they always helped
1139748 guess what im a psycho and now that im licking your face i want to kill you
1139749 you didnt give us a forum to discuss this so what did you think would happen we need to heal
1139750 tracie thinks she is so cool because she has bangs
1139751 the thing that i can do is i can just write
1139752 ooh i never actually bothered to watch the interview in question its totally not that bad
1139753 omg i love that show what is jon stewart like
1139754 just because i am a woman with a vagina i am not automatically classified as a potential rape victim
1139755 she plied us with booze and then took advantage of us
1139756 you and moe were so drunk as to be incomprehensible which doesnt come though in the transcript
1139757 regardless of what you said how you said it was completely unprofessional
1139758 well maybe you did defend what you believe in but i dont like your shoes

1139769 we have to take it to the mechanic and he would fix it and then we will go back on the fweeway
1139770 then you will go to the store and get some more and i will eat life cereal
1139771 julian what will happen if we get to school and there are no teachers there
1139772 then you will read me some books and then we will hear voices and it will be a teacher
1139773 julian what if we go to the zoo and a zebra gets in our car
1139774 what if grandma jackie makes pumpkin pie and puts in on her head
1139775 so one day officer buckle gets a police dog what happens next
1139776 holden would you like to sleep in diapers or underwear

1139779 leaving no room for the director in bed who therefore must sleep in a chair
1139780 no one wants to come here because its some chairs surrounded by cement
1139781 ultimately financial matters are personal and we work to respect the privacy of the families
1139782 its aggravating it just makes you mad you do that much work and they just squander it

1139786 many teachers do some or all of these things on the fringes of their traditional jobs by paying them for their time dale is trying to cement these roles in their careers
1139787 a solid grasp of mathematics for teaching or an in depth knowledge of the specific math needed for their classes and how to make it understandable to students
1139788 instructionally relevant content knowledge for teacher candidates rather than just focusing on more generic math content
1139789 are there other factors that are on the margin of teacher influence parent support content and style mandates in large districts embedded disruptive students my continuing education courses show me yet another way to present the distributive property or use problem based learning but quite avoid the issues that most challenge me and other teachers
1139790 all things being equal the study showed students taking at least two classes taught by novice uncredentialed teachers miss an average of two more school days a year than peers with more qualified teachers
1139791 who said that they would quit their job rather than work with 9th graders
1139792 creative ways to engage students interest and increase their learning
1139793 the country has to provide teachers with other professional opportunities
1139794 if the country wants to pay teachers like professionals it has to provide them with other professional opportunities
1139795 kids routinely score higher than similar students on standardized tests
1139796 dont want to walk away from benefits and service time accrued
1139797 regularly provides information and opportunities to help them be come a better teacher
1139798 work rules and school duties affecting teachers should be defined by contract
1139799 how are we going to force teachers to work in difficult situations
1139800 a meltdown after seeing how poorly my kids did on a standardized test
1139801 i could never rise above the feeling of humiliation that i felt each day when i tried to address 20 or 25 kids and might find none of them paying attention to me
1139802 i was speaking out of emotion but i think rivalries will always be a big part of college football
1139803 im as proud of how our coaches coach as any place in america
1139804 he will always be looked at in the big ten as an innovator
1139805 im thinking well guess what that happens in every damn league
1139806 i dont know you want me to spell it i d o n t
1139807 we ask people that they judge this roster based on what they do
1139808 every time states authorize across the board pay increases in equal percentages to all teachers regardless of contribution they create an incentive for the lowest contributors to remain in the profession
1139809 teachers need even more sophisticated abilities to teach the growing number of public school students who have fewer educational resources at home those who are new english language learners and those who have distinctive learning needs or difficulties
1139810 the words are not meant to be perjorative only descriptive these are common words
1139811 no i told them that too were gonna win and lose by them
1139812 but what other job can you get that provides you with 11 13 weeks off a year you only work until 2 30 or 3 00 with an occasional meeting after school and a dance once in a while
1139813 hell take a little bit more of a long term look its been short term look in that job for a while now for him this is a 20 year thing he plans to be here 15 20 years and we need that stability he has an incredible opportunity to really take things to another level how can you do it without continuity
1139814 i am bill prahler assistant womens lacrosse coach at msu
1139815 msu will not be moving to the prominent radio station name excluded as requested that currently carries u m football and basketball and wanted to make the switch msu says it wanted to stay loyal to citadel and apparently this was an offer it could refuse
1139816 oh my god this is just like corporate tax incentives
1139817 will i go after toyota or will i put out a corporate propaganda video that pretends im better than toyota
1139818 ahhhh oh jesus no mercedes benz is going to destroy us with its superior german engineering ahhhhhhhhhahahaha oh wait my brain went out again silly me
1139819 hurr hurr talk about a hypocrite shitty writer making fun of another writers shitty writing lols
1139820 id have a boner too if i were on chuck norris ring
1139821 sir permission to thank you for the privilege of allowing me to kiss your ring
1139822 to all those guys out there looking for a good woman stop looking
1139823 vote for me then guys ill take away female suffrage and legalize rape
1139824 wireless internet may well destroy our chances of contacting intelligent life
1139825 theyre only apologizing because they got caught they say what theyre thinking
1139826 ive probably been proudest of him after some tough losses
1139827 most of us at the end of our work day dont have a press conference to ask us what happened he went up there and he talked
1139828 im much more relaxed about it now i know my kid can play out there i dont have the anxiety anymore and i think were gonna surprise a lot of people this year
1139829 microsoft thinks it can teach its rival a thing or two about searching the internet
1139830 pagerank is just one of more than 200 signals we use to determine the ranking of a web site
1139831 experimental results show that browserank can achieve better performance than existing methods including pagerank
1139832 the more visits of the page made by the users and the longer time periods spent by the users on the page the more likely the page is important we can leverage hundreds of millions of users implicit voting on page importance
1139833 an extremely large group of users under legal agreements with them
1139834 its not a group thats going to run the athletic department
1139835 but its a group we may bounce ideas off what about this what about that we know where to draw the line were doing it for the right reasons and well find the right balance and the truth is we get more input probably from our 100 dollar donors than our million dollar donors
1139836 when weve uncovered an area of need in the department and when people have that inside knowledge when something is needed theyre much more amenable
1139837 i thought wed have an opportunity to set the bar in terms of pro athletes giving
1139838 the big ten is way behind in terms of endowments
1139839 thats what brings you your stability with endowments you can just draw off the interest
1139840 i dont know that john l was particularly involved in the process he wanted it but he wasnt as involved mark dantonio has been very involved in putting the facility together figuring out how he can best do his job and thats been a great pleasure
1139841 womens golf coach stacy slobodnik is probably the best of our coaches shes very natural shes not afraid to come out and say what she needs and it doesnt hurt that shes a great golfer
1139842 they have great affection for this place and theyre usually willing to listen right away at other places ive been it took 10 to 15 tries just to get an appointment
1139843 chuck is a fund raiser and he does push i try to bring the connection to the school being an alum is an advantage because you have that shared passion
1139844 its a delicate balance you cant forget your roots as a school for the people which you take pride in but you have to pay the bills
1139845 i tell you what that guy knows how to do it gifts with a major dollar value they dont just fall off trees former head of development chris ritrievi did a good job but chuck sleeper has brought it to a new level
1139846 might the name of a donor or perhaps a corporate sponsor find its way onto an msu athletic arena some day value city arena anyone
1139847 how does it help us get to the rose bowl
1139848 if we built that today it would probably cost twice as much to do it i dont think we could build it today
1139849 people are so positive i look for the day when we go 11 1 and see what happens then i know we have the person capable of getting us there is there a correlation between winning and giving absolutely but its not as big as getting out there and making people feel part of the program there are people who are interested in supporting this program regardless
1139850 the loyalty of msu football fans truly is something to behold erratic mediocre football with a few exceptions for a couple decades now and still you show up and pay good money
1139851 its critical that program womens basketball does develop because those programs become an entry point for younger fans they can build an emotional attachment and thats why we market them they provide emotion not revenue
1139852 were a land grant school and my feeling is you should be able to offer as many opportunities as possible
1139853 who is first in the noose mid majors the eastern michigans and western michigans those are the canaries in the mine shaft
1139854 educate the next administration about the need to put in place a comprehensive plan for addressing the needs of the many iraqi men women and children who have been displaced from their homes and are at risk of persecution
1139855 several hundred detainees have been released from guantanamo because there was no evidence they were ever involved with al qaeda or with any sort of terrorists
1139856 you thought the sleeping giant was still sleeping well weve woken up and its time to take our message forward
1139857 its better to spend that marginal marketing dollar to provide service that creates free marketing through word of mouth that kind of marketing you literally cannot buy
1139858 i am not surprised with gaos findings with respect to the job of federal agencies in the coming months this transition can work and be beneficial to the cnmi economy and her people but it will clearly need a collaborative effort from cnmi leadership and other stakeholders to be a success
1139859 the nbpts has the potential to make a valuable contribution to efforts to improve teacher quality together with other reforms intended to create a more effective environment for teaching and learning in schools increase the supply of high quality entrants into the profession and improve career opportunities for teachers
1139860 hey have you been to kokies its a coke bar called kokies
1139861 a tell me wat u think of my dick i need a girls oppinion im 18 i would like it if u could send me a pic of ur pussy im into phone sex if u want to exchange pics
1139862 oh nothing its just really hard for me to get off with a condom on
1139863 seriously im really sorry about the cum on the lips thing hope you didnt take offense i was just doing too much homework and didn t really think about it before i sent it
1139864 you know ive been blowing you for over an hour right
1139865 just look at your pants and everything will be ok kira just keep concentrating on your pants
1139866 i just aquired them figured it out on my own
1139867 the board has agreed in the settlement agreement that any meaningful transaction including the strategy in dealing with that transaction will be fully discussed with the entire board before any final decision is made
1139868 wait just a second i have to cut the cord now there you go little francis drake leach
1139869 guys inability to perform sexually has him crying for help from the law
1139870 man turns to the law to keep his sexual disappointments secret from future females
1139871 48 73 thats how much it costs to fill my gas tank these days
1139872 and i am sick of it why cant those politicians do something about this
1139873 if they wanted to go offshore right now any place in the world it would take 10 to 15 years before they could get a drop of oil
1139874 it will show the oil markets that we are serious about the problem
1139875 they have 16 million acres they can drill on today
1139876 i keep hoping it will end up like that book i read when i was a kid pinocchio i expect to see all these big noses out there on the senate floor because these are outright fabrications
1139877 america has less than three percent of the oil in the world counting anwr the arctic national wildlife refuge and all that offshore stuff but we use 25 percent of the worlds oil everyday you cant produce your way out of the problem drilling wont do it
1139878 we call upon the congress to say no to coastal drilling in protected areas and yes to a comprehensive solution a new apollo program for america that will invest in clean renewable energy and homegrown fuels and create millions of high quality green collar jobs
1139879 best answer to out of control oil prices is offshore drilling that wouldnt yield a drop of new oil for 10 years thats not a solution thats a distraction advocated by the same big oil companies who are making record profits
1139880 would also prick the speculative bubble that contributes to record prices
1139881 gas prices have doubled in new york even as the federal government has opened millions of acres to drilling and done virtually nothing to address our need for renewable energy sources

1139958 68 olympics salute deserves no honor espn ignored the violent extremism behind the black power salute given by two medalists at the mexico city games
1139959 the stench of self congratulation surrounding espns decision to honor smith and carlos is thicker than the air in a locker room after double overtime the argument that smiths and carlos critics must dine on their denunciations rests on an inch deep nostalgia and the triumph of celebrity culture
1139960 in todays culture is it even worth trying to remind people that the black power salute was for those who brandished it most seriously a symbol of violence rhetorical political and literal against the united states it was the high sign for a racist militia the black panthers which orchestrated the murder of innocents and allied itself with americas enemies
1139961 but even a more benign view of the salute shouldnt obscure the intense contradictions of espns decision to honor carlos and smith both men were members of the olympic committee for human rights which wanted a complete black boycott of the 68 olympics the committee considered an entire generation of heroic black athletes including jesse owens and jackie robinson to be uncle toms
1139962 i do support the individuals who decided to make the sacrifice by giving up the chance to win an olympic medal i respect their courage we need to understand the reason and frustration behind these protests it was different in my day perhaps we lacked courage
1139963 another important distinction that should matter is that this was 1968 not 1938
1139964 but the question is not and never has been whether the olympic ideal can be achieved but whether it should be pursued by embracing those who spat on that idea it seems espn thinks the answer is no

1139972 as any experienced it staffer whos been on the sharp end of a big business merger or acquisition or even a radical change of leadership will tell you businesses dont act like machines that eas can simply steer so that they tend towards technology optimisation in fact its the opposite business change forces new competitors new product launches new market launches new regulations mergers and acquisitions and so on will always drive entropy tending to push it estates towards chaos the best value an ea team can really provide in this environment is to help the it organisation to absorb these changes with as little stress as possible and drive consistent planned responses

1139977 that if the iraqi government were to tell the us to withdraw its forces the us would refuse to do so
1139978 it is clear that the iraqi people are quite eager for the us to lighten its military footprint in iraq more importantly it appears that they are eager to regain their sense of sovereignty as long as they do not have this sense they are likely to continue to have a fundamentally hostile attitude toward all aspects of the us presence in iraq

1139992 a coherent teacher development system that builds knowledge and skill
1139993 i had to refocus not on what i wanted the students to learn but rather what the students needed to know this was a huge and much needed paradigm shift for me i also noticed that while my lessons were well planned my assessments were not i lacked authentic student self assessment and consistent evaluation measures it is difficult to see your shortcomings pointed out in such an obvious way in fact sometimes i just couldnt believe that i had been so blind however this was a critical step in moving my teaching to the next level as painful as it was to see those weaknesses it was through their identification that i saw the most growth in my teaching
