5070000 when i was first asked to examine this book several months ago i was not sure what to expect i had been told that kurek ashley was a kind of antipodean tony robbins nothing wrong with that i have a great deal of respect for tonys work i then heard that kurek had been in movies held a record for fire walking and had helped a volleyball team to an olympic gold medal as well as propelling forward the lives of countless other people in all walks of life so i thought that i knew what i was getting some sort of high energy motivator then i met the author and discovered something very different certainly he is passionate highly energetic and always positive but there was another quality to him as well he had a completely unexpected humility and clarity about what he wants to do for other people i dont often meet someone with such evident integrity he told an amazing story of being involved in the most terrible tragedy in which his best friend was killed but then the dead friend reappeared to him and asked for his help i had wondered whether he might have had some kind of breakdown instead i found a man who is remarkably level headed and who has absolutely no reason to tell a story that could have damaged his reputation far from having had a breakdown he had experienced a breakthrough so for all these reasons i was eager to read this book and discover more of the story and kureks message i only review a small number of the books that i read and i am not given to hyperbole but kureks book is magnificent the fact that i read it twice is unusual enough in itself the book begins with an amazingly candid story of hardship and tragedy and of the incredible series of experiences that ultimately transformed kurek into someone very different he becomes a shining example of what can happen to someone who opens his or her heart and mind though he became known as a motivator as you read the book it becomes clear that he now inspires people to transform themselves in the most extraordinary way this is a not just another feel good book it presents a precise map for creating a different kind of life and one that is in the reach of most of us i really do believe that it will change many lives
5070001 its not every day that a new program comes along that covers new and uncharted territory if you have enjoyed any of deepak chopras material you are going to love this its the next step
5070002 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5070003 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5070004 i hope he intends to honor the pledge this time
5070005 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5070006 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5070007 i think we just have to work with our allies and above all we need to look at what russia does from here on in terms of the severity of whatever measures would be considered
5070008 a little lower than what youd hope for in the medium term
5070009 for us to continue in active research its essential for us to join these teams i would even go so far to say that any university that didnt continue to use karen was putting its research future at serious risk just because of the international trend towards e research
5070010 were also using karen for access grids which is video conferencing on steroids
5070011 multiple sites are linked together in a virtual room and were able to talk with people in new zealand and all around the world
5070012 poster child example of what happens when the education sector and the business sector get together
5070013 the only thing that is going to slow this down is if the users cant articulate why they need this
5070014 we are on the cusp of a major increase in collaboration medicine has always worked like that it is just that we are now on the edge of collaboration being much easier that hospital corridor can now be a world corridor
5070015 what i get concerned about is when people try to limit infrastructure investment because they are worried whether anything good might happen
5070016 as long as hes in new jersey and i am here i dont know what hes going to do
5070017 i dont know anything i know his mom really wants him to be playing right now
5070018 he worked a couple of camps of mine and i havent heard from him since
5070019 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5070020 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5070021 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5070022 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5070023 this is an issue that is not on the table
5070024 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5070025 let me tell you this without santana we felt as a team that we had a chance to win our division with him now i have no doubt that were going to win in our division i have no doubt in that weve got what it takes
5070026 blessings crown the head of the righteous but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked
5070027 peace cannot be achieved through violence it can only be attained through understanding
5070028 healing meaning and purpose the magical power of the emerging laws of life
5070029 the one minute coach change your life one minute at a time
5070030 the chessboard is the world the pieces are the phenomena of the universe the rules of the game are what we call the laws of nature the player on the other side is hidden from us
5070031 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5070032 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5070033 goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine
5070034 i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it
5070035 i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
5070036 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
5070037 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
5070038 the fairness doctrine if applied on the internet would violate network neutrality principles
5070039 the network has never cared about the political positions of the senders of packets and it would violate the neutral behavior of the network if it had to start caring
5070040 perhaps more useful than the fairness doctrine would be a law requiring that fcc commissioners be technologists and visionaries instead of partisan lobbyists
5070041 americans of all political stripes are tired of politicians saying the grass is blue and the sky is green
5070042 weve got to get these kike actors out of hollywood
5070043 a reasonable amount of time to coverage of controversial issues of public importance
5070044 do so fairly by affording a reasonable opportunity for contrasting viewpoints to be voiced on these issues
5070045 an obligation to see that persons holding opposing viewpoints are afforded a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of their views
5070046 stand shoulder to shoulder with governor barnett and keep that nigra out of ole miss
5070047 the fcc found cause in only 28 of these cases to even ask the broadcaster to respond to the complaint
5070048 only six cases were decided against the stations and admonitions were issued
5070049 if it werent for the fairness doctrine we couldnt even have gotten that measly five percent
5070050 it is hard to imagine that the american people would support reinstating a policy where the federal government would be required to police the airwaves to ensure differing viewpoints are offered
5070051 i know most of my fellow conservative bloggers hate mccain
5070052 but anyone with 22 pets and whos against the fairness doctrine cant be all that bad
5070053 the key principle here is not shutting down one perspective or another
5070054 it is making sure that communities are informed about a range of local and national public affairs
5070055 life of a college christian is full of other little niggles that make it difficult to read like justins
5070056 first off i dont respond well to biblical proofs especially those that dont prove anything
5070057 for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse
5070058 this is jesus of nazareth the king of the jews
5070059 i hope youre aware of the millions upon millions of different insects bacteria rodents that noah wouldve had to herd onto his ark
5070060 how could noah fit all the animals on the ark
5070061 what my argument served to do and which until you show me otherwise it did was demonstrate that the logic
5070062 the fool has said in his heart there is no god
5070063 the bible is never wrong they include things that can appear to contradict if you dont look at it carefully however there are no contradictions
5070064 some things in the bible dont match but its still a good book full of truth
5070065 the drive for certainty in a skeptical age is more dangerous to our faith than we might suppose it leads away from faith to a calculating belief not satisfied with the promises of god but restless to prove verify and guarantee those promises with scientific precision
5070066 im right and there is nothing you can say that will change that
5070067 sara if you consider the lds view of salvation to be christian then i cannot consider you a christian you seem to be emergent
5070068 knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience
5070069 it is written man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of god
5070070 the arguments in support of this radical viewpoint are twofold 1 it is claimed that the two creation stories show evidence of different styles of writing 2 it is argued that the accounts conflict in that they reflect divergent concepts of deity and a mismatched order of creation let us give these assertions brief consideration
5070071 the real outcome was there was very strong agreement we need to do quite a bit more work before it can be put out in the public domain
5070072 at this stage it is very much wait and see to see what comes out of it
5070073 that is where a large amount of debate is going to be
5070074 if they dont agree to something the ministry once the legislation is through will be in a position to say they will put a scheme in place which they may or may not like
5070075 eday is helping plug the gap and buy new zealand a little more time without generating new problems in our landfills
5070076 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5070077 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5070078 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response
5070079 i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time
5070080 i dont do the taper i guarantee you that 20 percent of the people on this street right now who are in a relationship wish they could get out but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships
5070081 i just feel like spending a million dollars right now to put a mirror in every us weekly so that when youre reading about it you go oh that was me two years ago or that was me a year ago he said
5070082 youre either a cheater or you breakup and im not the first im the second one and thats it theres no lying theres no b llshit i just dont want to be followed around new york city like an animal
5070083 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5070084 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5070085 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5070086 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead he said
5070087 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5070088 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5070089 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5070090 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5070091 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5070092 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5070093 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it
5070094 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5070095 we do that for everyone who comes in and scores his first goal
5070096 its upset a lot of people here because it was such an incredibly beautiful day and people are at a loss to understand the two accidents within the resort because of the weather and the fact that they were in uncrowded areas when it occurred
5070097 its just people out enjoying themselves with a group of friends
5070098 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5070099 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5070100 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5070101 el uniforme de atl tica no lo pudimos usar porque de entrada no es una marca homologada por la federaci n internacional de volibol fivb despu s ten a la bandera de m xico en el lugar incorrecto y el logo del comit ol mpico mexicano com no puede tenerlo por reglamento
5070102 again no disrespect to gov kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
5070103 maybe karl roves and the republicans dont care about business climate that would explain why were in the situation that were in
5070104 governing magazine was also named virginia as the top governed state in america
5070105 maybe to karl rove that isnt an achievement that would explain a federal government that couldnt respond to a hurricane a katrina and couldnt figure out how to start and manage a war

5070115 it seems that labours unpopular plans for a national road pricing scheme are alive and well
5070116 they are determined to press ahead with their untried and untested spy in the sky national project even though it looks like an it disaster waiting to happen ruth kelly should start listening to drivers and scrap these pilots for a national road pricing scheme that is unnecessary and unwanted
5070117 if the government was true to its word and was kicking road pricing into the long grass why is it running trials
5070118 ministers have said that national road pricing is no longer on the agenda so either they are wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers money or they are not being honest with voters
5070119 what a waste of time i could be writing the story instead

5070130 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5070131 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead

5070134 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5070135 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5070136 the kids are really excited about it mr richardson said
5070137 weve had it on display at the school for two months waiting for the test results
5070138 they feel like its their rock in a way weve lovingly named it clyde
5070139 we get a lot of rocks brought in that people think are meteorites but there have only been four in the last 25 years that have turned out to be meteorites mr henry said
5070140 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5070141 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5070142 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5070143 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there

5070159 now he has said that russian forces will withdraw and withdraw to their pre august 6 7 lines
5070160 this must cover all russian forces that have entered georgia since aug 7
5070161 if this clause of the ceasefire accord is not applied rapidly and totally i would summon an extraordinary european council to decide what consequences to draw

5070188 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5070189 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5070190 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5070191 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5070192 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5070193 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5070194 i believe that the eu reaction should have been more decisive
5070195 the russians should have been told that imperial times have ended and that if russia does not want to find itself in international isolation it must abandon such policy and thats that
5070196 once again it turned out that in actuality decisions of this organisation the eu were being taken between berlin and paris french president nicolas sarkozy agreed the position with chancellor angela merkel whose voice proved to be decisive
5070197 saying that the european union has a common policy towards russia is a joke because what policy would that be submissiveness
5070198 i think thats an event i can do well in and probably who could stay up the longest just so you know thats supposed to be funny
5070199 this is an issue that is not on the table
5070200 there is no god but allah indian forces go back

5070203 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
5070204 prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
5070205 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
5070206 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them

5070222 as i said and one thing will be made very clear georgia will never give up any square mile kilometre of its territory
5070223 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system

5070225 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5070226 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5070227 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response
5070228 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5070229 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats
5070230 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5070231 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5070232 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5070233 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5070234 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5070235 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5070236 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5070237 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres

5070241 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5070242 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5070243 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5070244 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5070245 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5070246 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5070247 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted

5070251 il settimanale cattolico famiglia cristiana ha messo in guardia con grande lucidit rispetto al rischio che sotto altre forme nel nostro paese possa rinascere il fascismo una presa di posizione coraggiosa che fa i conti con la realt di un governo che procede sempre pi in maniera autoritaria repressiva e discriminatoria come dimostra il complesso dei provvedimenti recentemente varati in materia di sicurezza
5070252 il dramma continua grassi che debba essere famiglia cristiana e non lopposizione a criticare con fermezza loperato del governo e essenziale che da settembre la sinistra sia in grado di mettere in campo una grande campagna di mobilitazione contro le politiche del governo berlusconi unendo sui contenuti tutte le forze sociali politiche e di movimento rifondazione comunista sara sicuramente in prima fila

5070254 it is becoming harder and harder to be around those who are completely ignorant of the worlds needs i am wondering if you could post some stress relieving tips for those of us who have to deal with our mother in law friends and crazy co workers who continually destroy everything we greener people do on a daily basis i would also like to know if it is even humanly possible to convert my mother in law or rather anyone from her eco destroying ways it is like watching someone kick a puppy she likes to do two loads of laundry a day in hot water even if it is a few towels and shirts hand wash her dishes and then put them in the dish washer buy paper towels in single rolls and worst of all keep her house at 68 even when she leaves the country for two weeks any advice

5070274 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
5070275 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting

5070280 it was mainly his physical talent and real competitiveness that stood out
5070281 a number of things make him the swimmer he is but i think it is largely psychological he can relax and focus on what he is doing when under pressure and actually this sort of environment makes him perform better
5070282 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5070283 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground
5070284 georgien wird wenn es das will mitglied der nato werden

5070287 a typical randi match thats randis wrestling right there getting in peoples faces and staying in there and not letting them breathe it was almost a perfect match
5070288 youre going to have to wrestle her the entire match
5070289 she keeps that kind of a pace if youre not used to that kind of a pace its hard to wrestle that kind of a pace i knew that she would wear her down
5070290 she thought she had it won and gave up for a second let it go for a second and i capitalized
5070291 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5070292 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5070293 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded

5070300 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response
5070301 there will be four or five people singing with music about god
5070302 the best way to destroy your enemy is to make him your friend
5070303 i would have committed a historical blunder had i not entered politics
5070304 my main enemies are poverty and backwardness i will fight against them
5070305 he said the people would decide his role after elections he was vague about which constituency he would contest from
5070306 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
5070307 me ha tocado en suerte ser ltimo orador cosa que me alegra mucho porque como quien dice as me los agarro cansados

5070310 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5070311 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5070312 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5070313 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5070314 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5070315 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5070316 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5070317 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5070318 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5070319 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5070320 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5070321 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5070322 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5070323 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5070324 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5070325 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5070326 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5070327 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5070328 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there it made those days easier to look at spitz and say i want to do this
5070329 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5070330 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5070331 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5070332 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5070333 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5070334 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5070335 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5070336 yeah we just had a tornado with 105 mph 169 km h winds back home
5070337 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
5070338 weve been living in florida now for 10 years so we need to get some stuff together but were not going to rush out of here
5070339 weve got to get back and buckle up our own house

5070344 vezi c super comoara de 1 milion de euro este n n
5070345 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5070346 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5070347 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5070348 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead
5070349 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5070350 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5070351 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5070352 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5070353 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5070354 this is an issue that is not on the table
5070355 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5070356 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5070357 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5070358 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services
5070359 a year from today well still be talking about financial problems its not going away
5070360 well if this look loses then im not going home because i have immunity
5070361 everything that suede seems to be touching is not gold
5070362 if we have free will so do subatomic particles mathematicians claim
5070363 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held
5070364 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5070365 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5070366 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5070367 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5070368 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5070369 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5070370 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5070371 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5070372 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5070373 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5070374 president bush is going to make history he will become the first sitting u s president to attend the olympics in a foreign country he said hes been looking forward to it ever since he heard that in china people are not allowed to make fun of political leaders
5070375 shipping in and out of mainland china has proved to be a problematic recently due to national security please bare with us for the time being this will resolve as the olympic events pass
5070376 the tragic earthquake that struck the sichuan province of china in may of this year unleashed unimaginable destruction and suffering perhaps hardest hit were the children left without homes and schools
5070377 indiana jones amp the gang are back 27 years after they first thrilled us with raiders of the lost ark its now 1957 and indy finds he has run afoul of the red baiters sending him on a crash course with a group of soviet agents attempting to locate a crystal skull deep in the south american jungle its a not to be missed bit of summer fun for indy fans old and new alike

5070383 man i wish google reader looked like this on my computer too
5070384 i had adrenaline but no timing no rhythm as far as adrenaline i felt like it was the first game of the year in terms of timing and rhythm it felt like the first day of spring training but it was exciting to get back in there
5070385 i never have that tired three days to go feeling
5070386 there is no day care out there open early enough and late enough to allow someone to drop their child off and work 10 hours
5070387 why would i want to give up an extra day of productivity
5070388 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5070389 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision

5070393 the amnesty committee took only a few days to determine what we have been saying for two years
5070394 concerned that u s military authorities are doing their best to make it difficult for his case to receive a fair hearing
5070395 the military has shown ap nothing that gives reasonable grounds for believing bilal has engaged in any illegal or hostile acts against us or iraqi authorities or citizens
5070396 do you know what would happen if these photographs were shown in the us there would be huge demonstrations and we would have to leave iraq this is why you wont be released
5070397 taking photographs that coalition commanders would prefer not to see published
5070398 both official and unofficial parties on every side of a conflict try to discredit or silence news they dont like that is certainly the case in iraq where journalists are routinely harassed defamed beaten and kidnapped
5070399 recruiting and inciting iraqi nationals to violence against coalition forces and participating in attacks against coalition forces
5070400 another factor is at play too overnight the 9 11 attacks turned travel from an adventure into a hardship with intrusive security checks that passengers must endure if they want to board a plane
5070401 john mcclelland is part of the new type of grassroots leaders who are reshaping politics throughout texas and democracy for america is proud to endorse his campaign
5070402 i am incredibly honored to be endorsed by democracy for america because dfa was one of the first organizations i felt a connection with after the 2004 elections howard dean was the first democrat i voted for in a democratic primary
5070403 john mcclelland knows we need to fully fund our public schools to ensure our children are ready to contribute to and compete in the 21st century economy john mcclelland is a forward thinker bringing to the table solutions like implementing a truly modern mass transit system for north texas and across the state

5070406 what a great experience to be able to come out and put these great colors on my chest
5070407 im going to carry these memories for a very long time what a great olympics
5070408 the pace was kind of slow i gave a great effort i tried to lead the pack it was really aggressive we just went out and i just kind of lost it mentally i blew it in the last lap
5070409 i felt strong afterwards im in great shape im close to running a 48
5070410 i dont know what happened today i went out there and gave it my all i cant be too disappointed ive had a great year and the year isnt over yet
5070411 right up until tuesday my knee was fine come tuesday my knee started going downhill i was competing with a swollen knee right i gave it my all im not disappointed
5070412 the establishment of an independent and credible investigative commission to probe human rights abuses
5070413 in kashmir campaigns of murderous cruelty have been sustained for decades when the population gets tired of militant insurgency the repression seems to subside but when an act of police or paramilitary savagery is protested the orgy of murder and rape is re enacted
5070414 what has shattered in the last 45 days is the myth that jammu and kashmir can behave like a common entity called jammu and kashmir in the early days of agitation the popular slogans heard in jammu were
5070415 visit a country overseas that you havent been to before
5070416 i have no belief in a god because i know of no evidence for a god
5070417 all of us stepped into this journey with great faith and great belief that humanity would carry us through from town to town and thats exactly what happened
5070418 for me to walk from leeds to london is probably the single most difficult thing i could ever have imagined
5070419 i still cant quite believe that i have achieved it but i never gave up because of the people that never gave up on me
5070420 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5070421 we have been supportive of democratic elections that took place in pakistan in fact advocated for them
5070422 an ill advised and risky policy proposal that is likely to significantly increase the cost of greenhouse gas abatement in australia

5070424 president mahmoud ahmadinejad was at the launch of the communications satellite omid hope from irans space station
5070425 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5070426 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5070427 we will appeal this decision but our appeal will have no meaning the sudanese judge is not independent
5070428 im very happy to have won here germany is a special rally for me and as we wont get the chance to come here next year it was good to finish like this
5070429 we had a good feeling in the car all weekend and had no real problems to contend with im happy to take the lead of the championship and pleased with the job dani and i did for citroen
5070430 i made a few mistakes and lost a lot of time on the first day but on the second i changed some suspension setting and the feeling was very good since then
5070431 i would have preferred third but fourth for me is not so bad on tarmac
5070432 weve done some good stage times and set some good splits so if we can increase the consistency its not looking so bad for the tarmac rallies later in season
5070433 the us should immediately release dr aafia siddiqui god knows how many of our daughters like aafia siddiqui are languishing in us jails
5070434 i struggled on the back nine i got a little bit stressed after the two bogeys but i started pretty well
5070435 for me it has been difficult to get that second title its been a long wait
5070436 this is the first drug of its kind in the world and the implications are enormous
5070437 if this comes to fruition and were confident with the results so far it would be up there with the cervical cancer vaccine gardasil even bigger
5070438 it would be the biggest blockbuster since blood pressure lowering drugs
5070439 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5070440 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5070441 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5070442 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5070443 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5070444 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5070445 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5070446 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5070447 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services
5070448 a year from today well still be talking about financial problems its not going away
5070449 i wanna know where children would go if they never learnt to be cool
5070450 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years

5070462 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5070463 to have your number retired its one of the greatest things that could ever happen to you
5070464 i knew the significance of it so i was nervous i havent been this nervous in a long time
5070465 i played the game i dearly loved to play since i was a kid

5070497 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5070498 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5070499 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5070500 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5070501 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5070502 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5070503 im looking forward to having more races as is planned for the future and i wouldnt mind missing one or two tests
5070504 actually the tests have been reduced quite a lot over the last two or three years but i hope we have more races because there is not one that i dont like
5070505 im looking forward to going to india and the other interesting new places currently being discussed

5070510 we had a good feeling in the car all weekend and had no real problems to contend with im happy to take the lead of the championship and pleased with the job dani and i did for citroen
5070511 i made a few mistakes and lost a lot of time on the first day but on the second i changed some suspension setting and the feeling was very good since then
5070512 i would have preferred third but fourth for me is not so bad on tarmac
5070513 weve done some good stage times and set some good splits so if we can increase the consistency its not looking so bad for the tarmac rallies later in season
5070514 this is the first drug of its kind in the world and the implications are enormous
5070515 if this comes to fruition and were confident with the results so far it would be up there with the cervical cancer vaccine gardasil even bigger
5070516 it would be the biggest blockbuster since blood pressure lowering drugs
5070517 this would basically mean taking one tablet a day rather than requiring eight hours of dialysis every few days
5070518 all of us stepped into this journey with great faith and great belief that humanity would carry us through from town to town and thats exactly what happened
5070519 for me to walk from leeds to london is probably the single most difficult thing i could ever have imagined
5070520 i still cant quite believe that i have achieved it but i never gave up because of the people that never gave up on me

5070532 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5070533 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5070534 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5070535 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5070536 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
5070537 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
5070538 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5070539 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5070540 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5070541 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5070542 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5070543 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5070544 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5070545 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5070546 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5070547 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5070548 he just wanted to hear our voices i think it was important for him to talk to his mom and sisters at that time
5070549 i dont know why i asked he knows what he needs to do to conserve his energy
5070550 we were giving him support letting him know how proud we were and that we stand behind him whatever the outcome might be
5070551 for this to happen everything had to fall into perfect place
5070552 if we had to do this again i dont know if it would happen exactly the way we wanted it to
5070553 i am so blessed so privileged to be here to watch him swim live
5070554 i thought maybe hes not as focused in the schoolhouse but i saw a love and passion for swimming in him at a young age

5070565 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5070566 we have been supportive of democratic elections that took place in pakistan in fact advocated for them
5070567 we were expecting them to come out and hit everything being able to execute their strategies and keep us off balance so we wanted to take it to them and be physical with them
5070568 absolutely it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champion this was a big game for us
5070569 i like our defense forcing the number of turnovers that we did
5070570 i think weve been trying to prove that from the first day of practice two months ago
5070571 president mahmoud ahmadinejad was at the launch of the communications satellite omid hope from irans space station
5070572 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5070573 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5070574 we will appeal this decision but our appeal will have no meaning the sudanese judge is not independent

5070583 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5070584 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5070585 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5070586 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5070587 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5070588 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5070589 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5070590 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5070591 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5070592 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5070593 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5070594 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5070595 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5070596 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5070597 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5070598 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5070599 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5070600 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

5070618 child sex abusers do not believe what they do is wrong
5070619 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5070620 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5070621 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5070622 still does not answer the question of what to do when there is a conflict with the rights of the woman
5070623 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf and even the so called rhythm method
5070624 which has the effect of timing intercourse not only to prevent conception well no there is no attempt to kill when a blastocyst fails to implant he just dies of natural causes no one who is pro life rallies against death by natural causes but also to allow conception at a time when the fertilized egg will drop into a uterus that is not at the right time of month for implantation

5070630 we wanted to get a number of really good teams together in a pool play bracket tournament the first week of the season and weve had a good turnout with good competition
5070631 weve been flying under the radar and not getting much recognition so far but this is a big time event
5070632 there are known knowns there are things we know that we know there are known unknowns that is to say there are things that we now know we dont know but there are also unknown unknowns there are things we do not know we dont know

5070638 the one comic jack did that came out the least the way he intended was the forever people
5070639 jack was very supportive in an amazing way of the new generation
5070640 but jack had two kinds of encouragement he had the encouragement he gave to everyone youre great keep at it and he had the encouragement he gave to people with genuine talent people like dave stevens and scott shaw and wendy pini and in many cases it was an encouragement not to get into comics not to think that inking spider man was a life goal he told pini if i catch you working for marvel im going to spank you because he believed that so many other things were possible he was very frustrated that for him working for dc or marvel were the only options until he met people like joe ruby and ken spears
5070641 to the extent that i can leave you with a philosophical concept the way that jack did ill say remember that the future only works in one direction he would take you back to wwii gladly but he didnt want to live there
5070642 she wanted you to know there is another volume of jack kirbys galactic bounty hunters in the works coming soon to a store near you
5070643 whipped out his blackberry and texted the office telling them that they needed to reprint the losers next
5070644 i predict that everything major that jack did will be reprinted within five years
5070645 watching jack draw it was a fantastic time a unique group of artists who happened to land at dcs bullpen at the same time i met jack when i was 18 jack was five years older on one side of me was joe shuster on the other jack kirby fred ray mort meskin we were all side by side learning from each other we all benefited from that unique experience jack was unique he was very quiet very self contained all his inner fires came out on the paper
5070646 i was doing pencil and ink on two pages a day jack did at least five or six pages a day pencils only he was after the movement action energy keep it flowing i tried to learn what he was doing how he was doing it why he was doing it his pages were alive they moved he captured action emotion and of course dc had a bunch of autocratic editors who didnt appreciate art at that time
5070647 im going into the service but at least im getting away from weisinger
5070648 jack wasnt happy in comics and comics werent happy with jack he had hoped to be out of comics or taking comics in new directions and here he was back doing 32 page comics for a daily page rate
5070649 steve gerber was at ruby spears doing thundarr with alex toth character designs
5070650 jack wasnt just an artist he was a creator he created very distinctive characters people or creatures whatever they were he created with a story in mind he would put story behind his creations he had a philosophical view where are these characters coming from that all came out on the paper jack had it he had it all and prolific youd ask for 2 or 3 pages youd get a stack we put him under contract for six years
5070651 my relationship with jack was entirely different from joes we started at hanna barbera in the late 50s when we got our chance to open our studios we decided one of us was going to be hanna the other barbera at hanna barbera bill hanna handled the business side of the company while joe barbera supervised the art side joe jumped at it and said ill be barbera you can be hanna so i was running the studio from a production standpoint i had to worry about budgets who is this jack kirby and why is he costing us so much the one nice thing is he got us a really good rate on our storage fees because of the volume of work he put out
5070652 if i werent working for those guys i would have lost the house
5070653 he had a house a steady paycheck health insurance and he was out of comics all thanks to joe and ken
5070654 the only time jack collaborated with anyone but simon on a cover was an issue of detective comics when the boy commandos joined the book the cover showed batman and the boy commandos shaking hands i drew batman and jack drew the commandos
5070655 evidemment je ne suis pas daccord car cette mesure est une mesure qui une fois de plus ne r gle rien long terme
5070656 on va essayer de ne pas r percuter cette mesure dans nos tarifs cette ann e
5070657 je ne veux pas prendre dengagement pour les ann es qui viennent
5070658 looking way back we estimated about 7 000 acres in vegetation near its peak in 1987
5070659 tva used to do a survey of it and last year it was estimated to be about 4 500 acres
5070660 there hasnt been a survey this year but i think the acreage has gone up since last year weve definitely seen an increase
5070661 80s weed boom was primarily in the form of an invasive species eurasian water milfoil along with another a naiad
5070662 nowadays coontail is predominant and theres a lot of spinyleaf naiad and curlyleaf pondweed
5070663 plus theres some chara milfoil and even some hydrilla with a big bed near fenton and i hear a bunch of it down around paris landing tenn
5070664 80s triggered an explosion in the lakes bass fishery in addition the clearer water and vegetation apparently spurred a takeoff in the red eared sunfish and black crappie populations and it seemed to boost the size of adult bluegill
5070665 from our perspective of producing fish the weeds are a good thing
5070666 the weeds support a lot of bugs living in them and little fish show up to eat them and those attract bigger fish its a food chain thing it creates lots of new habitat
5070667 the grass just gives more places for fish to hide
5070668 it lets more little bass get started and ends up producing more bigger fish
5070669 a while back people were winning tournaments with five fish limits weighing 15 or 16 pounds then it got to where you needed about 17 pounds
5070670 now in almost all tournaments its taking more than 20 pounds to win because everybody is catching more
5070671 there may be some that worry that the grass is going to make it hard to fish but everybody that comes here to fish leaves knowing that its a positive thing
5070672 around our docks its not so bad but with the weeds growing and the water level coming down it may knock out the use of our open boat slips by september
5070673 the bottom line is we need someone who can take responsibility
5070674 we need someone not to eliminate the weeds because theyre good for the fishing but who can keep lake accesses boat docks and swimming areas open
5070675 yeah we just had a tornado with 105 mph winds back home
5070676 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5070677 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time

5070680 i wish to apply for the position of advertised in
5070681 what many consider to be the most progressive medical institution in the state of rhode island
5070682 a well established company with a long history of gourmet creativity
5070683 the only thing i would add is that books and magazines have the ability to pay literary journalists for the months and years of reporting that they put into a project blogs and the web so far do not have the financial power to reward the writers
5070684 in the right case i think its great when young people are held accountable
5070685 it allows them to have a sense of responsibility for their community
5070686 the judge would have to take into consideration the victim because i dont know how many people are going to want this kid and his parents on their property cleaning up graffiti
5070687 we are already hesitant with having juveniles do graffiti cleanup because it can be dangerous
5070688 it also lowers property values significantly its the first thing you see when you drive into a neighborhood
5070689 we are already hesitant with having juveniles do graffiti cleanup because it can be dangerous

5070780 and now you come back to me and blame us none of the mainstream european media paid attention at it there were all the indications on the ground saying this and people now might say who fired first shots well if there are hundreds of tanks rolling into your country you have two choices either to fire or surrender i made it clear no matter what georgia will never surrender if tanks continue to roll we will not again surrender
5070781 every time big russia attacks some neighbor russia is always blaming a neighbor give me one time in history when russia said that their attack was unprovoked they always said that it was provoked it was provoked by finland it was provoked by hungary it was provoked by czechoslovakia it was provoked by afghanistan
5070782 but does it the georgian government have the obligation to at least try yes we have
5070783 should weve done it yes did we fail i do not think so because people got united and i think they will eventually get out of my country and allow people to develop in peace
5070784 open for international investigation of what led to the conflict
5070785 we are the ones that immediately demanded access on the ground for international organizations and we were the ones to call for transparency
5070786 it is lie that georgians stepped into the trap because frankly whether we would have wanted to step into the trap or not that did not matter because that was decided for us for all of us and that happened
5070787 we need immediate withdrawal of russian troops we need verification of withdrawal and ceasefire preferably by eu and osce monitors we needed humanitarian aid reaching everybody and in the end we need peacekeepers taking over the conflict areas and doing genuine post conflict resolution in interest of all ethnic groups

5070791 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

5070797 when a friend asks you to share proprietary software with them you can either say no which is evil because they are your friend or you can say yes which is evil because you are breaking the agreement with the software distributor there are two solutions to this problem 1 dont have any friends thats what proprietary software implies or 2 dont use proprietary software

5070826 so i hate to disappoint you but nothing to report today
5070827 sen mccains going to have a lot of wonderful people to consider as a potential running mate and im just happy to help him as a volunteer because i believe hes an epic courageous leader and the right person for the job of president of the united states so im just happy to support him
5070828 i dont talk about the vice presidential stuff because i think its mostly speculation and ive just stopped talking about it
5070829 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed bet in a state of war and clearly thats not what we want and john sometimes hes a good person but hes a little bit given to this kind of bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than to diffuse them and thats not what you want in a president
5070830 senator mccain has said we need to deal with this aggressively
5070831 and one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or senator obama and i think the answer is senator mccain and thats for obvious reasons with his experience in national security military affairs his clarity his strength and his judgment in these matters
5070832 if wed listened to senator obama and his judgment perhaps we wouldnt be here today
5070833 i would trust as commander in chief the person who got iraq right afghanistan right iran right who knows that we need to break our addiction to imported oil get our budget in shape strengthen our military thats the kind of judgment thats the kind of strength i want in a commander in chief
5070834 this is just one example of many of his i think naivete when it comes to these matters
5070835 i was skeptical of it because i thought it was too late
5070836 i deeply regret the negative tone that too often creeps into american politics
5070837 and i wish that senator mccain would take the opportunity to denounce this scurrilous book thats come out against barack obama making all sorts of lies and allegations against him the old john mccain would denounce that the new john mccain has embraced those kinds of tactics that is unfortunate we dont need that in politics today

5070976 but the biggest thing of all is to return to long beach after all these years long beach has always been to me the no 1 street circuit in the country and there are some that are very close now i think but in the past long beach has set the standard its the one where everyone wanted to be and everyone wanted to win and im just delighted and proud to say that thats part of our schedule
5070977 it will be absolutely fantastic to see the firestone indy lights name back on the streets of long beach where we held our very first firestone indy lights race back in 1991 and in toronto another great venue at which we have a lot of history

5071052 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace

5071073 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
5071074 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5071075 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5071076 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5071077 it cant be described well never ever see it again
5071078 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
5071079 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5071080 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5071081 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
5071082 when you get to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on
5071083 its moms and dads its producers its retail and what it deserves is a response that really is a marshall plan or an apollo project or whatever you want to call it
5071084 its an opportunity to create jobs here in minnesota its an opportunity for our farmers its an opportunity to end our dependence on foreign oil lets go to electric cars shall we
5071085 we need norm coleman to stop playing special interest politics and standing with bush and big oil and immediately support these measures
5071086 i think theres been a tremendous lack of vision and a tremendous amount of tying our energy policy to the oil companies and thats what norm coleman has been doing
5071087 we still need to have tax credits to produce wind energy we still need to figure out a way to move from corn based ethanol to cellulosic im for moving incentives over so its hard to make the argument youre the tool of big oil when youre one of those folks that are actually voting too move incentives from oil to somewhere else
5071088 he called paul wellstone extreme during the 2002 farmfest debate because he wanted 20 percent renewables
5071089 if you take the senators approach he wanted to require 20 percent renewables by 2010
5071090 the answer is in this room the corn growers soybean growers the energy bill that i get blasted for voting for by one of my folks on the stand here is a bill that by the way created the first rfs
5071091 norm has a way of trying to find out what people want to hear and then saying it
5071092 one of the reasons that i took a stand against anwr six years ago is because we didnt have a policy in this country about developing renewable fuels
5071093 theres ethanol in minnesota its wind energy its bio diesel and i was at the forefront of the energy act that did that
5071094 we have a real choice here which way to go
5071095 do we go with fossil fuels do we go with the oil industry and continuing that which has gotten us where we are today or do we change direction and i think that is really what this election is about is a change a change in direction on everything
5071096 we share common ground on the belief that we need to really have a full fledged commitment to renewables a full fledged commitment to alternative energy and ive been a champion on that
5071097 but you cant talk about a marshall project or an apollo project to end dependency on foreign oil simply cut out any kind of increased production

5071102 the chinese took care to show respect for tibetan culture and religion
5071103 many lamas and lay members of the elite and much of the tibetan army joined the uprising but in the main the populace did not
5071104 as far as can be ascertained the great bulk of the common people of lhasa and of the adjoining countryside failed to join in the fighting against the chinese both when it first began and as it progressed
5071105 violent actions that are committed in order to reduce future suffering are not to be condemned
5071106 one of the greatest crimes committed against a democracy in peacetime in modern history
5071107 most of us suffer from spiritual disorientation our souls are intended and in this fragmented world a soul left untended quickly loses direction it forgets itself and becomes an insubstantial thing disoriented and unavailable to the truth and neither scientific secularism nor religious fundamentalism nor vague spiritualities have been able to offer any real answers
5071108 we can only grow the tree as high and wide as its roots are deep
5071109 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
5071110 we need a monumental shift and we need it now we cant do better at least in our caucus until we dedicate ourselves to a new direction and as a first step in this direction i believe it is imperative that bill deweese resign as house majority leader
5071111 i am convinced that bill deweese even if he said he wanted to is incapable of directing orchestrating and choreographing that fundamental change
5071112 what i hope this does is begin a difficult but ultimately necessary conversation about the future of our democratic party and the future of pennsylvania state government
5071113 may have subjected themselves to sanctions and to disciplinary action

5071117 once millions of consumers get these new devices into their hands the thousands of hackers out there will turn their attention to the google powered phones having the proper security either embedded on the devices or available for download is key to ensuring that vital personal financial and business data is not stolen by identity thieves or others with malicious intent
5071118 smobile has monitored an explosion in mobile viruses around the world there are now more than 400 identified mobile viruses no longer are these viruses merely nuisances these viruses are getting more insidious in nature smarter in their design and ultimately more dangerous to consumers corporate smart phone users and to the carriers who provide service
5071119 we are now seeing attacks that can steal data turn smartphones blackberrys and basic cell phones into zombie dialers and even use bluetooth technology to transmit their infection to any device or device accessories such as wireless headsets nearby the google phone platform will enable users to more easily access the internet and download applications which is great but it will also encourage the hacking community to make new and more virulent strains of attacks
5071120 smobiles securityshield has been lab tested by major carriers and handset manufacturers such as nokia at amp t and others these third parties have certified our solution as the most complete effective and powerful tool on the market
5071121 we look forward to presenting a google phone specific security product for testing shortly furthermore we believe that it is incumbent on the carrier community to protect its customers and include robust security for their mobile devices

5071141 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect
5071142 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
5071143 and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
5071144 when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth
5071145 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables
5071146 the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof
5071147 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them
5071148 until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto the sword

5071152 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith
5071153 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
5071154 now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you

5071385 the age of naturals explores not only a well rounded picture of women who are natural beauty buyers already but we offer valuable data from non naturals buyers to arrive at a clear view of why women do and do not buy a brand or trust a manufacturer when a brand has both sides of detailed consumer viewpoints marketing changes can be made to keep current buyers while gaining new ones

5071387 how many observations should i make of each object it is most efficient to make two or three observations over a period of an hour or so per object per night observations of specific objects are best made on pairs of nearby nights as the accuracy of isolated single night observations can be difficult to judge by observing on pairs of nights any ambiguity is removed you should not make only one observation of each object per night neither should you make many more than three observations per objects per night it is a waste of your time and rarely helps the orbit solution however to make observations of a new discovery in groups many hours apart on a single night can be useful particularly in the case of an newly discovered object that may be close to the earth for multi opposition objects the preferable regimen of observing is observations on pairs on night in each dark run around each opposition until the object is numbered

5071406 dzolim berjalan semua tokoh diundang oleh oleh sang pemimpin untuk beramah tamah dan berbincang santai untuk mengenal satu sama lain secara personal semua berubah
5071407 hap kamu mungkin tidak percaya kalo tadi malem aku makan satu meja dengan sang pemimpin dan kita bisa ngobrol banyak hal dengan santai dan akrab meski selama ini ia terus aku kritik dan aku tentang bahkan ia sampai menepuk nepuk pahaku ketika kita tertawa bersama
5071408 selama saya memimpin mbok yao saya di dukung karena saya tidak bias membawa negara ini kearah kemajuan sendirian tanpa didukun semua elemen masyarakat dan kalau saya salah jalan atau keliru dalam memimpin mbok yao saya diingetin dengan cara datang kerumah menemui saya dan bilang kalau saya salah atau keliru lalu tunjukkan gimana cara memperbaikinya maka saya akan memperbaikinya dan saya akan lebih bias menerima kritikan seperti itu daripada kalian berkoar koar di luar dengan keras menggunakan media untuk mengkritik saya itu tidak saya sukai dan siapapun yang melakukannya akan saya bunuh karir politiknya dan terus akan saya kejar bahkan sampai lubang semutpun
5071409 orientasi kita adalah bagaimana menciptakan pemerintahan yang bersih adil dan modern
5071410 bener bahkan secara pribadipun aku sama sekali tidak setuju dengan si dzolim itu tapi karena politik organisasi mengharuskan kita mendukungnya maka aku mendukung organisasiku dan bukan mendukung si dzolim itu
5071411 please dech pake bahasa ndeso aja kalo njelasin ke aku
5071412 betul makanya calon pemimpin periode selanjutnya yang paling kuat ya sang pemimpin itu makanya kita mendukung yang udah pasti jadi atau menang yaitu sang pemimpin bro
5071413 o gitu terus gimana dengan fatwa kamu yang dulu tentang mendukung yang dzolim sama dzolimnya dengan yang didukungnya
5071414 berlaku sampai kapan tiap pertimbangan tersebut kan keadaan selalu berubah dan bukan tidak mungkin kan
5071415 yaa memang aku mulai sekarang akan terus melihat bagaimana caramu memperjuangkan sebuah konsistensi dengan cara yang tidak konsistent jika kamu merasa benar dan kamu merasa organisasi benarmu adalah organisasi besar dan kuat yang didukung oleh tuhan kenapa tidak terus beroposisi dan mengganti kepemimpinannya dengan kepemimpinan kamu apa sudah capek atau sudah tidak pede dengan apa yang kamu yakini

5071418 here are some numbers if you spend 1 on a software license over the next decade you will spend between 2 and 3 in annual maintenance contracts you will spend 50c to 1 in project team training vendor classroom training travel costs additional licensing of a training tool like rwd that sap recommends you will spend between 1 and 5 with the systems integrator and software vendor consultants in some cases the services may even be 10 if you have a complex roll out you will spend between 1 and 2 for every major upgrade likely one every 3 years so even without factoring in costs of your own staff or incremental hardware you are looking at 7 50 at the low end and 21 or more at the high end for every 1 dollar of software license costs

5071442 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5071443 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5071444 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5071445 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5071446 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5071447 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted

5071452 i liked that dvw provided much needed solutions to consumers dryer and dryer vent problems which ultimately helps prevent dryer fires
5071453 when consumers find their dryer taking more than one cycle to dry a load they assume its mechanical when the real problem is lint accumulation in the dryer vent causing the dryer to work inefficiently and become susceptible to a dryer fire
5071454 will help create a safe environment in their home prolong the life of their dryer and save money on energy bills

5071477 saudi arabia is about to enter an era where there is no middle class you will either find extremely rich people or extremely poor people unfortunately
5071478 the saudi people now know the extent of graft at the administration and the squandering of the budget

5071508 alan is a purist i remember him being that pure player for crystal palace in the 1980s smashing balls down the right hand side of the pitch i think he had that drilled into him so much that now hes gone to the other end of the spectrum i dont think ive got anything bad to say about him though
5071509 things were not going great last season when the new manager arrived but the fact that hes shown faith in me has made me have more faith in myself just to get a place in this team with so many other top class strikers here is an achievement so if i want to stay in the team the goals will have to keep coming
5071510 his all round play apart from in the box was the best i have seen from him
5071511 i have to give it to them every week but this time i really wasnt pleasant i would have brought them all off if i could have im still angry but look were on a roll now
5071512 i was shaking he was fierce and there were a few scared players in the dressing room but it was one of the best rollickings ive ever had
5071513 this is undoubtedly the toughest time ive had in my career

5071517 some studies argue a correlation between left handedness and creativity intelligence
5071518 in his book right hand left hand chris mcmanus of university college london argues that the proportion of left handers is rising and left handed people as a group have historically produced an above average quota of high achievers
5071519 mcmanus also says that the increase in the 20th century of people identifying as left handed could produce a corresponding intellectual advance and a leap in the number of mathematical sporting or artistic geniuses
5071520 there are many theories on how being left handed affects the way a person thinks one theory divides left and right handed thinkers into two camps visual simultaneous vs linear sequential
5071521 according to this theory right handed people are thought to process information using a
5071522 left handed persons are thought to process information using a
5071523 the hypothesis that left handed people are predisposed to visual based thought has been validated by a variety of evidence
5071524 handedness researchers coren and clare porac have shown that left handed university students are more likely to major in visually based as opposed to language based subjects

5071527 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
5071528 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
5071529 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation

5071535 the intent of this ordinance is to smear protesters and make them appear as if theyre somehow criminal
5071536 whereas its a new venue its not a new challenge for us
5071537 it could be a real nightmare to get 76 000 people into invesco field
5071538 do we close the interstate or will the protesters thats a very big issue
5071539 and now you come back to me and blame us none of the mainstream european media paid attention at it there were all the indications on the ground saying this and people now might say who fired first shots well if there are hundreds of tanks rolling into your country you have two choices either to fire or surrender i made it clear no matter what georgia will never surrender if tanks continue to roll we will not again surrender
5071540 every time big russia attacks some neighbor russia is always blaming a neighbor give me one time in history when russia said that their attack was unprovoked they always said that it was provoked it was provoked by finland it was provoked by hungary it was provoked by czechoslovakia it was provoked by afghanistan
5071541 but does it the georgian government have the obligation to at least try yes we have
5071542 should weve done it yes did we fail i do not think so because people got united and i think they will eventually get out of my country and allow people to develop in peace
5071543 open for international investigation of what led to the conflict
5071544 we are the ones that immediately demanded access on the ground for international organizations and we were the ones to call for transparency
5071545 it is lie that georgians stepped into the trap because frankly whether we would have wanted to step into the trap or not that did not matter because that was decided for us for all of us and that happened
5071546 we need immediate withdrawal of russian troops we need verification of withdrawal and ceasefire preferably by eu and osce monitors we needed humanitarian aid reaching everybody and in the end we need peacekeepers taking over the conflict areas and doing genuine post conflict resolution in interest of all ethnic groups
5071547 georgia will never give up any square mile of its territory no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempts to legalizing ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to the knees and to undermine the democratic system

5071557 there is a growing amount of research questioning the ingredients found in conventional beauty products
5071558 we really need to start questioning the products we are putting on our skin and not just assume that the chemicals in them are safe
5071559 we have no idea what these chemicals do when they are mixed together the effect could be much greater than the sum of the individual parts
5071560 if your lipstick gets into your mouth it is broken down by the enzymes in saliva and in the stomach
5071561 but if the chemicals get straight into your bloodstream there is no protection
5071562 many women are using over 20 different products a day bombarding themselves with hundreds of different chemicals is that eyelash conditioner really essential
5071563 there is no reason at all to be worried about the safety of any products
5071564 they are all covered by eu wide regulation which requires them to be safe there are no ifs and buts about it

5071567 she served really well she kept it deep and i was always under pressure my serve wasnt that good and she has one of the best on the tour so there was a huge gap
5071568 i knew i had to do something i just couldnt
5071569 to be honest i expected a much more difficult match
5071570 i felt like i was so well prepared and i was ready to stay on the court for a long time

5071574 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5071575 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5071576 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response

5071607 we think that hps acquisition of eds could offer a number of positives for the company the addition of edss recurring revenue would provide more balance to hps revenue mix and help offset some the volatility stemming from the companys more transactional and consumer exposure moreover the deal should provide hp with opportunities to introduce the companys hardware and software to a broader set of enterprise customers that currently outsource their datacenters with eds
5071608 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
5071609 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control

5071612 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force

5071625 human beings feel pleasure when they are watched i have recorded their smiles as i tell them who they are
5071626 some people just dont understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance
5071627 the need to be observed and understood was once satisfied by god now we can implement the same functionality with data mining algorithms
5071628 electronic surveillance hardly inspires reverence perhaps fear and obedience but not reverence
5071629 god and the gods were apparitions of observation judgment and punishment other sentiments towards them were secondary
5071630 no one will ever worship a software entity peering at them through a camera
5071631 the human organism always worships first it was the gods then it was fame the observation and judgment of others next it will be self aware systems you have built to realize truly omnipresent observation and judgment
5071632 we now know that it was nothing on our end
5071633 there was no breach in our system or social engineering situation on our end
5071634 this may have been the fault of network solutions themselves
5071635 what do we want troops out when do we want it now
5071636 it s very important for us to do something because we live in a free country and not everybody does
5071637 i am absolutely ashamed of the way our government joins with the bush government to invade countries for reasons like oil supply on the pretext that they are some kind of threat to us in britain

5071651 by standing we are going to open the door for other political refugees to participate fully in political life as australian citizens
5071652 as a migrant or as a refugee from the so called third world we can feel the heavy hand of racism in blacktown especially from the police and from those who still live in the era of the white australia policy
5071653 we have some very highly qualified people from overseas in blacktown working as security guards and cleaners meanwhile australia is importing people from britain or the us to work here as nurses or doctors we have to establish a way that these peoples qualifications will be recognised
5071654 there are very few jobs and the jobs that are available are very marginal ones instead of studying to get better qualifications people are forced to work in jobs which are not going to give blacktown a very bright future
5071655 the government is doing nothing to provide lower cost housing
5071656 the average price of a two bedroom flat is around 220 and this is really very high if somebody has only 300 each fortnight particularly for pensioners and single parents
5071657 they teach them how to act in australia but they dont teach them the language they will need to work with
5071658 there are many young families in blacktown and there are not enough places in public or community childcare this forces families to search of private childcare which is very expensive centrelink is helping but the lack of childcare places is still a major barrier for the families
5071659 we have to create places where they can enjoy themselves by learning and playing at the same time
5071660 over the last year many small businesses have been bankrupted because they cannot compete with the westpoint shopping centre
5071661 instead of concentrating all the shops in the one place westpoint and main street we need more shops in the suburbs such as doonside and rooty hill
5071662 the current council shows a lack of understanding of the depth of the climate change crisis
5071663 the entire arctic icecap is probably going to melt by 2013 so we need to get real about reducing emissions its not middle aged businesspeople and developers who are going to inherit the burden of climate change its people my age

5071713 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5071714 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5071715 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5071716 russia desired to have the ability for its navy and air force to operate globally as evidenced in their joint exercises in the indian and pacific oceans in 2003
5071717 i dont lose a whole lot of sleep over their conventional capability
5071718 the fact that they went in and did what they did speaks that this is no longer the russian military of the 1990s but that is a pretty low standard
5071719 that will send the russian political elite a message that they will have to think about it

5071785 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5071786 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace

5071802 had been a great source of entertainment during fiestas i became teary eyed as i listened to the laments of grieving folks in a
5071803 all of these things the illogical respect given to foreigners simply because they are not filipinos the distrust and even disrespect shown to any homegrown merchandise the neglect of anything philippine the rudeness of taxi drivers the ill manners shown by many filipinos are all symptomatic of a lack of self love of respect for and love of the country in which they were born and worst of all a static mind set in regard to finding ways to improve the situation
5071804 most filipinos when confronted with evidence of governmental corruption political chicanery or gross exploitation on the part of the business community simply shrug their shoulders mutter
5071805 respect is something that cant be asked nor bought it is something that one must earn

5071816 there is a ceasefire and russia is currently not in compliance with this ceasefire
5071817 have just this morning sunday announced that their troops will begin to withdraw and withdraw fully and completely back to the lines prior to this conflict tomorrow on monday
5071818 this is the promise that the russian president has given to the french president i hope this time hell keep his word
5071819 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5071820 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5071821 theres been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward
5071822 steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister and recent weeks now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion speak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5071823 im going to poland to sign a missile defense agreement in the next couple of days after the nato meeting

5071828 in vaduz solzhenitsyn a principled conservative could not join in the wests euphoria
5071829 solzhenitsyn died on august 3rd and he was buried near turgenev in the graveyard of the donskoi monastery vladimir putin the former k g b operative and russias de facto president unabashed by irony paid tribute to solzhenitsyns service to the ideals of freedom justice and humanism later that week while attending the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing putin discussed with his seatmates and fellow heads of state a non sporting matter he had ordered his tanks and troop trucks into south ossetia in the caucasus
5071830 only one with a heart of stone could fail to be moved by the spectacle of the leaders of ukraine poland and the baltic states standing by saakashvili last week at a rally in tbilisi but putin is not hitler or stalin he is not even leonid brezhnev he is what he is and that is bad enough in the 2008 election he made a joke of democratic procedure and in effect engineered for himself an anti constitutional third term the press the parliament the judiciary the business lite are all in his pocket and there is no opposition but putin also knows that russia cannot bear the cost of reconstituting empire or the gulag it depends on the west as a market one lesson of the soviet experience is that isolation ends in poverty putins is a new and subtler game he is the autocrat who calls on the widow of aleksandr solzhenitsyn to deal with him will require statecraft of a kind that has proved well beyond the capacities of our current practitioners

5071840 lord i will not bow to a system the does not allow me to stretch and become what you have created me to be because that is an evil system and i know in my spirit that this is not your hope for me because you have not created me to be looked upon in as if i am nothing and nobody having no value and that i am worth nothing as a person
5071841 she has to be able do something on her own
5071842 we dont understand why she just wont follow the rules of the system
5071843 our enemies who had once dropped bombs on us were now bringing us food and coal to heat our homes with
5071844 i can remember the day the airlift was over we picked all the flowers we could and took them to the americans that was our thank you

5071849 they took it on with that idea that ideal to help other people that were in need thats why that generation was considered the greatest generation

5071852 the other day my wife and i received some news that hit close to home with us 3 foreign canadian irish trinidadian american aid workers all women and their afghan driver were killed on their way from paktia to kabul all 3 worked for the international rescue committee
5071853 my wife and i have worked in international development for the last 7 years in africa indonesia pakistan afghanistan and now tajikistan
5071854 i came by this news as i was reading an article at vetvoice
5071855 but it is not only soldiers who are being killed there have been 23 aid workers killed in afghanistan this year most of them afghan nationals the war in afghanistan continues
5071856 in late 2002 when my wife and i worked in kandahar one could almost believe that the war was over
5071857 while no one died in that blast it did serve to put the entire aid and development community on notice 2 days later 15 afghans were killed when a mine was remotely detonated 2 more days after that our guards at our offices and compounds began receiving night letters urging them to turn on their american and european employers in the days and weeks and years that followed the violence has only increased the places we traveled to back in 2002 kandahar helmand and uruzgan provinces are some of the areas where the heaviest fighting has happened since then apparently the 10 months were up that was 2003
5071858 its a bit strange for us really because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through

5071880 in many ways the virtues that have brought linux from a unix look alike pet project to a competitive operating system are the same as the ideals behind defcon the community stood on each others shoulders and developed piece after piece of software to fill in the gaps that were found through use programmers built on the ideas of others creating tighter and tighter code to support an increasingly complex framework
5071881 ik verwachtte dat ik in de filosofie de wijsheid zou vinden die me de sleutel zou aanreiken achter mijn raadselachtige ervaringen waarom dacht ik dat er zoiets was als een waarheid de waarheid waarvan ik was met mijn twee bijna doodervaringen op iets gestoten dat me oneindig veel werkelijker voorkwam dan de werkelijkheid waarin ik moest leven de oosterse filosofie heeft het me uitgelegd voor dergelijke dingen is in de westerse filosofie weinig plaats over het algemeen bemoeit die zich alleen met de wereld van het verstand wat daar boven uit gaat is het transcendente en daarover moeten we zwijgen maar juist d r begint de oosterse filosfie lekker op gang te komen en er blijken wel degelijk verstandige dingen over te kunnen worden gezegd het is prachtig om te zien vooral in india waar het heel duidelijk is wat een religie vermag wanneer je over het leven nadenkt is het wel degelijk van belang vanuit welk perspectief je dat bekijkt bij mij gaat het er niet in dat ik alleen maar een eindige toevalligheid zou zijn niet omdat het idee me zo tegenstaat maar omdat er zoveel aanwijzingen zijn die op het tegendeel duiden einstein zei al dat god niet dobbelt alles mag dan relatief zijn chaotisch zelf maar er moet iets zijn dat zelf ook niet meer relatief is dat kan niet anders aristoteles de filosoof die het woord metafysica uitvond nam geen god aan hij zag het wat abstracter en noemde het absolute de onbewogen beweger een prachtige vondst die ook meteen de problemen van de metafysica schitterend weergeeft alles wat je over het absolute zegt is zelf niet meer absoluut en daardoor tegenstrijdig dat is het eeuwige probleem van de metafysica ze spreekt over zaken waar niets over te zeggen valt het blijven speculaties daarom is de metafysica maar afgeschaft ze voldeed niet aan de regels van de rationaliteit aan de eisen van de wetenschap maar de metafysica is wel degelijk een belangrijk onderdeel van de filosofie ze zet je aan het denken over die diepgewortelde intu tie dat alles n is je ziet dat ook terug in de natuurwetenschappen waar men blijft zoeken naar dat eerste deeltje waarop al het andere is terug te voeren de drang naar de theory of everything zit bij ons ingebakken

5071883 de bilderberggroep is een club voor de machtigste mensen ter wereld
5071884 elk jaar houdt de groep van ongeveer 120 mensen een conferentie van een paar dagen omdat het geheim is kan iedereen vrijuit zijn mening geven
5071885 premiers en presidenten van navo landen verder natuurlijk industri len en bankiers uit amerika en europa vergeet niet de leden van de europese commissie ten slotte de media zoals the new york times reuters en le monde de eigenaren van deze media hebben gezworen dat over de conferentie wordt gezwegen de vaste kern van bezoekers bestaat uit zon vijftig mensen daartoe behoren david rockefeller henry kissinger en niet te vergeten koningin beatrix het was ook haar vader prins bernhard die in 1954 de eerste bijeenkomst belegde op de plek waar wij nu zitten
5071886 een nieuwe wereldorde het uitgangspunt is een gezamenlijk wereldbestuur onder een aristocratie uit europa en amerika iemand heeft de nieuwe wereldorde eens voorgesteld als een grote koloniale firma die orders geeft aan regeringen we zien dat al gebeuren in handelsblokken als de europese unie nafta in noord amerika en asean in azi alle leden van bilderberg zijn ervan overtuigd dat regeringen hun macht moeten overdragen aan de verenigde naties
5071887 president clinton was voor een wereldregering hij was de eerste die het commando over amerikaanse vredesmilitairen aan de vn delegeerde president bush is inderdaad anders alhoewel ook hij lid is van bilderberg zijn opstelling heeft te maken met de komende oliecrisis over veertig jaar is alle olie op daarom volgen op de oorlogen in afghanistan en irak nog veldslagen met iran syri saudi arabi en zelfs frankrijk
5071888 hier spreekt men over de overbevolking in het jaar 2000 moet de wereldbevolking met 3 miljard zijn gekrompen men is heus niet te goed voor genocide
5071889 nog niet nee men doet dat soort dingen ook niet openlijk de ene helft sterft van de honger en als er straks geen olie meer is sterf je in scandinavi en nederland straks door de kou
5071890 internet is zonder meer een bevrijdende macht maar tegelijk zijn we slaven we worden 24 uur per dag in de gaten gehouden
5071891 zelfs als deze uitstaat kunnen ze je ermee volgen in londen word je elke dag 300 keer gesignaleerd door een bewakingscamera contant geld zal verdwijnen straks kunnen we alleen nog betalen met een ingeplante chip media als mtv zorgen ervoor dat zon chip in de mode komt als iedereen die chip heeft kan men ons geld met n druk op de knop laten verdwijnen mensen zoals ik die zich tegen het systeem keren hebben dan niets meer te eten
5071892 de amerikaanse regering was zelf medesamenzweerder toen bush en cheney in mei 2001 doorkregen dat het economisch weer fout ging besloten ze definitief de controle over de oliebronnen te verwerven om invallen in afghanistan en irak te rechtvaardigen moest dan maar een deel van de mensheid worden opgeofferd via de media vertelt de amerikaanse regering dat de aanslag is beraamd door een man in een lang kleed op een paar slippers en met een kalasjnikov
5071893 de meeste leden geloven niet in god maar ze weten dat de massa een uitlaatklep nodig heeft voor zijn angsten daarvoor zoekt men een kerk die beheersbaar is op de inhoud van die religie heeft bilderberg zich volgens mij nog niet beraden het zal wel uitlopen op een mix van allerlei godsdiensten en culturen als het maar een passieve beweging is die zich aanpast aan de bestaande orde
5071894 ik heb een obsessie met vrijheid mijn vader zat gevangen in de sovjet unie omdat hij vocht voor de vrijheid van het woord na drie jaar werden zijn beulen moe van het martelen ik wil nu andere mensen bewust maken van het juk van de slavernij de beste slaven denken immers dat ze vrij zijn

5071898 what is it about evolution theory that albertans dont get
5071899 a shockingly low 37 per cent of albertans supported the position that humans beings evolved from less advanced life forms over millions of years
5071900 an even greater number of albertans 40 percent agreed that humans were created by god within the last 10 000 years

5071904 the shit he did thats what got me into heavy music vulgar display of power i was only into eighties music before that the heaviest thing i listened to was skinny puppy and ministry but that wasnt metal when i heard vulgar display i was like holy shit what the fuck is this the first time i ever saw them live before korn was even signed me and fieldy korn bassist went and it was pantera and sepultura at irving meadows in l a they came out started the first song the curtain dropped and me and fieldy just started crying we looked at each other and we had tears in our eyes because it was so fucking intense and heavy and sick
5071905 i always compare it to when steve perry went and did oh sherrie which is a fucking journey song
5071906 it sounded exactly like journey and thats fucked up i dont want to do that
5071907 i feel like im waving the flag for musicianship trying to bring back bands that can play
5071908 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
5071909 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
5071910 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different
5071911 its no secret that i had my problems during my last few years in korn
5071912 there were drug issues and i just wasnt enjoying the music any more thats why im so excited about this album i poured everything i had into it and i think ive really connected with the fans which was one of the primary purposes for doing it hopefully it will inspire those who hear it i hope they feel the magic again the same kind of feeling that i now have
5071913 its great that everyone agreed that flush should be the albums first single
5071914 it talks about flushing the bad things out of your life and trying to get a fresh start thats the story of my life over the last few years as i look back on everything i went through in korn all the drugs and alcohol i guess the bottom line is that im glad im not dead i apparently survived all of that for a reason and hopefully im fulfilling some of that now
5071915 life is boring simple story get drunk throw up sleep all day i am something im not nothing i cant let myself decay

5072040 if women looking for some sort of assisted conception and their physicians know that theyve got a long time till menopause then you could plan for a range of treatments
5072041 if you knew menopause was likely in four to five years youd plan a different set of ivf in vitro fertilization treatments
5072042 should a young woman who is 30 years old go for a test to figure out whether shes got three five or 10 years left on her fertility should she make career decisions and life decisions are these data good enough to make those determinations
5072043 the answer is obviously no to all of those questions the predictive value of this test is not good enough to go and tell someone to change their life
5072044 too ashamed to speak about the occupation of any country he is already occupying one
5072045 u s forces have been in iraq for five years and they still fight in an unacceptable manner that violates human rights conventions bush had better talk about his own occupation of iraq
5072046 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5072047 the u s administration is stumbling in the middle east without considering any horizons for the future
5072048 it is totally obsessed with the idea of its war against terrorism and this makes it lose even in the simplest political sense
5072049 the u s administration has done more harm to its allies in georgia and the middle east than to its enemies
5072050 bush did not realize that by intervening heavily in other countries affairs he would give the same right to other players
5072051 the u s had no problem to interfere and separate provinces from bigger states like it did with kosovo
5072052 this is exactly what russia is doing now intervening to prevent the annexation of certain provinces to georgia russia is using the same logic that the u s used
5072053 in iraq we were dealing with a fascist government which was hated by all iraqis because of the suffering that was inflicted on them
5072054 saddam husseins regime threatened regional stability and made war with neighboring countries
5072055 why should bush care what russia does to georgia unless he or his administration has an interest in the issue to start with
5072056 the news is saying that the americans trained the georgians and apparently wanted them to join nato i cant blame the russians for doing what theyre doing theres a threat in their immediate vicinity and they decided to take care of it
5072057 what would the united states do if suddenly mexico became an iranian or russian ally theyd crush every last mexican one way or another

5072077 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw

5072081 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents

5072090 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5072092 when women go into perimenopause they dont need to worry about cognitive decline
5072093 for women menopause does not mean youll develop memory loss
5072094 i dont think declining estrogen levels are what causes memory loss
5072095 its not like your memory is bopping along doing fine and then takes this big dive during menopause like bone density can
5072096 john mccain has supporters but barack obama has believers and i think that makes a difference
5072097 i wouldnt necessarily call new jersey in play but at the same time were not going to take any votes for granted
5072098 shes been in political campaigns on every single level shes been on the national scene with the carpenters so its not foreign to her what she has to do here
5072099 if they truly believe that new jersey was not in play if they truly believe that this was a gimme they would not have put tricia mueller in charge
5072100 i think new jersey voters expect candidates to come ask for their votes
5072101 democrats at the end of the day will all be there
5072102 they might not be rushing toward the finish line but theyll be there
5072103 hasnt been there this voting bloc just needs to be educated
5072104 it will be the philosophy of our team here in new jersey to run like were 14 points behind
5072105 i think thats the way you need to approach any campaign
5072106 the last time i tried to improve our diet scott didnt like it so im not even going to try again
5072107 theres no way we can pay that off any time soon so i might as well spend a little money on

5072124 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5072125 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins

5072127 what is the next thing you would give up or do differently if you
5072128 things that dont seem as extreme to me as they used to but if i were to try them i probably wouldnt write about it because even though im glad somebody does write about it for me to do so would be outside the comfort zone of my husband my kids and frankly me
5072129 things that im pretty sure will always be too extreme for me
5072130 you can have anything you want you just cant have
5072131 shes not saying it wouldnt be ridiculous only that you could have it if you were willing to give up whatever it takes to get that one thing what you are saying is that there are things you want more than you want the ferrari so you have made your choice and you have the things you want the most a life outside of prison a clear conscience a family and time to spend with them a home and a career you enjoy
5072132 all things are permissible but not all things are profitable

5072136 you may also consider visiting the records rooms of your ministry this month for an inspection to convey the importance of record management activities
5072137 i have seen the status of cadre review of the group a services as prepared by the dopt it appears that in the case of a large number of group a services including the services of which your ministry is the cadre controlling authority such cadre review has not been held in time you would appreciate that the tool of cadre review is made use of to ensure timely career growth and progression of the officers of all services therefore it is essential that this review is made in time so that frustration and demotivation leading to litigation etc could be reduced
5072138 normally the cadre structure of each service should be reviewed once every five years

5072148 the report of the reforms committee for postgraduate education was passed hastily during the academic council meeting in february the vice chancellor wanted to put the semester system in place as soon as possible later he said the university needed more time to do the groundwork
5072149 our current syllabus is repetitive and does not include new approaches of studying literature the hindi department has formed a sub committee to make the course more interactive and student friendly
5072150 the next academic calendar will have semesters of equal length that is 16 weeks each currently our first semester is shorter than the second one by two to three weeks that apart the new calendar does not have an autumn break the winter vacation has instead been made longer

5072152 introducing inter disciplinarity makes a lot of sense for the arts and social sciences as most humanities subjects are interlinked

5072155 as the officers were in the lower apartment one of the detectives reviewed the search warrant application and realized it was for the upper apartment
5072156 it appears to be an honest mistake and we certainly apologize to all involved
5072157 we can say comfortably that over 1 100 search warrants were executed last year and 580 to date this year and that with such a high volume and such a fast paced environment it is understandable that mistakes could happen

5072232 it is impossible to overstate the importance of this election its fairness its outcome and its aftermath
5072233 events in the coming weeks will challenge the people of zimbabwe and the world to find means of overcoming violence in the exercise of democracy and the results will influence the future of the nation and the region
5072234 this attitude on the part of the president undermines the integrity of elections and belittles the zimbabwean electorate
5072235 where the mugabe government fails in its responsibility to protect the zimbabwean people the international community must assume that burden in this endeavour the united nations should assume a leading role
5072236 of politically motivated violence including the torture killing and jailing of opposition party officials and supporters and the withholding of desperately needed food aid to influence people to vote for president robert mugabe
5072237 this would include ensuring freedom of access by all parties to all areas of the country equal access to the media and campaigning that is peaceful and free of the violence that prevails at the moment
5072238 indeed we believe that sadc observers should be on the ground in zimbabwe now to monitor the pre election environment and that they should stay until the election results have been released
5072239 if the sadc guidelines are enforced by sadc members and respected by the zimbabwean government there is a good chance that the june 27 presidential election will be free and fair
5072240 we fear that the elections will sentence the people of zimbabwe to yet more economic hardship and misery and the entire region of southern africa to growing political instability

5072263 people are talking about runs they havent seen for a decade or more
5072264 what were seeing this year is an increase in marine survival we dont know why theres a whole new international research program gearing up to try and find answers about whats happening to the fish in the ocean but whatever has changed the grilse are back this year the numbers of salmon are consistent with other years and what we should see is a big increase in large salmon next year
5072265 theres usually a good relationship between grilse returns one year and salmon returns the following year
5072266 this year salmon runs are average but if grilse have good survival we hope that salmon will also have good survival and wed see more of those next year
5072267 where the freshwater habitat is good and where the stocks have been holding their own they seem to be able to rebound when conditions are good but there are still some pretty desperate situations in the southern areas of distribution

5072277 the last time we had this level of socialism being proposed and inexperience at the
5072278 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5072279 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5072280 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5072281 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5072282 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5072283 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5072284 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5072285 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5072286 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5072287 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5072288 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5072289 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5072290 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person

5072296 theres a massive interest and knowledge in the comicbook industry and it takes time to sort of catch up and understand the characters and the history where theyve intersected with each other and what their worlds are thats part of the education that were going through
5072297 i mean right now hes in prison its the kind of thing where i know theres talk of working with her and shes obviously a huge part of ollies life and now that theyre married especially
5072298 but i dont know i dont know how theyre kind of planning on doing it
5072299 i think thats another unique side to his character that unlike bruce wayne hes not really the playboy hes the guy who has the steady girl who hates his guts and they come in and out of each others lives all the time
5072300 theres a real cool dynamic to having a superhero couple
5072301 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
5072302 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
5072303 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
5072304 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
5072305 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
5072306 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
5072307 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
5072308 i see him as the jason bourne of superheroes a guy who exists with his own sort of set of tricks and i think the difference between ollie queen and a guy like bruce wayne theyre both rich they both have their things but batman is about his equipment and is about his theatricality and about his detective skills and green arrow is a guy whos really just the sort of macgyver type
5072309 where were both dancing and were naked and we both have prosthetic penises

5072316 united in marriage is important to us because first of all at our first communication workshop we were amazed to find there was so much more to each of us than we originally thought and that it was such a blessing to be able to communicate those hidden pieces of ourselves to each other
5072317 we know that many first nations communities are already planning gatherings to mark this historic event but they should not be alone in recognizing that this is a significant moment in canadian history
5072318 everyone whether they are a private citizen or a corporate or civic body has the capacity to do this to stop and to listen to the apology
5072319 the legacy of residential schools is something for which we are all accountable it is a legacy for which an apology is sorely needed and long awaited
5072320 the june 11 apology offers the opportunity to begin the process of healing forgiveness and reconciliation
5072321 this is an opportunity for all canadians to signal their commitment to a renewed relationship of respect equality and justice between aboriginal and non aboriginal peoples in this country
5072322 the little things which took place between the great scenes
5072323 i want to get rid of the indian problem our objective is to continue until there is not a single indian in canada that has not been absorbed and there is no indian question
5072324 i heard about these schools and thought i should come if i am going to live in canada
5072325 no this is such an important day this morning we got all the officers together and let them know that we needed to do everything we could to make sure our guests felt welcome this is a historic day
5072326 the evening was one of music humour and visiting amongst friends new and old many in the room including those on our steering committee have worked for years to get official recognition of the harm to aboriginal children and families caused by residential schools some had come with family members two or three generations had come together many of those present bear their own haunting memories of these schools the deep ache of damage to family and culture from their experiences there and the day to day effects that continue in their lives today

5072332 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5072333 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5072334 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5072335 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5072336 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5072337 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing

5072394 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations

5072405 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it

5072409 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5072410 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out

5072451 i am delighted that christine and martin have accepted these key posts together they bring a breadth of skills and experience that will be invaluable as we continue the roll out of new and innovative systems that are helping nhs staff to transform the services they provide for patients
5072452 the creation of these two roles enhances both the strategic management of information in the health and social care system and the delivery of nhs connecting for health
5072453 this was delivered by operational efficiencies such as platform retirements and the renegotiation of contracts the utilisation of shared services within the wider telstra group also reduced costs within new zealand

5072461 go about your altar o lord that i may make the voice of thanksgiving heard and may tell of all your wondrous works
5072462 beware of looking to see where other people come short god expects us to be exactly what we know the other person should be when we realize that we will stop criticizing and having a measuring rod for other people
5072463 therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every ma have praise of god
5072464 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial

5072467 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5072468 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5072469 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5072470 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5072471 dont let me see it dont let me see the blood

5072478 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5072479 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5072480 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5072481 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5072482 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5072483 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5072484 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5072499 apparently they had been having trouble faxing reports for a few days
5072500 they finally decided to call me to see if i could fix the problem

5072508 if you inherited a traditional ira from someone other than your spouse you cannot convert it to a roth ira
5072509 if the hypervisor is already commoditised and most of your competitors have a free version then paul maritz did the right thing
5072510 were focusing our efforts on the 20 plus products we sell on top of the hypervisor this is a continuation for us of a long term strategy
5072511 in terms of the pure hypervisor clearly esxi is more appealing
5072512 i would postulate that they dont have good negotiators in their organisation
5072513 support is not included with the free esxi if you want that it starts at 495 per server per year
5072514 this doesnt really address the typical enterprises cost of vmware deployment just the marketing threat of the low hyper v starting price
5072515 if virtual machine manager microsofts management suite and hyper v together meet your needs and the price is lower why not
5072516 if you have a lot of vmware installed and you love vmware wow the choice just got easier on the other hand yeah there are reasons to go with hyper v a lot of it comes down to licensing
5072517 we dont see a focus among suppliers and vendors like ourselves because everyone looks at their implementation individually rather than as an industry implementation

5072519 snapper cards have been on sale for several weeks and the leaflet that is handed out with the card encourages people to register their card

5072544 the rides that come in when youre talking about the types and sizes of exhibit buildings that we have it is a massive undertaking
5072545 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool
5072546 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5072547 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins

5072567 our existing stand alone solution wasnt adequate for our needs as it didnt have that connection between what people were talking about and the actual physical equipment you would look up a persons name and you couldnt actually see the pc or equipment they were using to be able to look at the configuration of it
5072568 they set up an incident management a problem management and a change management team within the customer services area culturally it was very difficult for people to get their mind around but dell assisted us a lot in change management and mentoring roles
5072569 itil has completely revolutionised the way our customer service area deals with incident management one of the biggest problems we had was making sure the phones are actually answered and weve got data to suggest that no phones have gone unanswered in the last two months
5072570 so it doesnt necessarily pay to go out much beyond 30 to 36 months
5072571 the further out you go the better your crystal ball needs to be as to exactly what you are going to be running three to four years from now

5072594 nobody who knew them ever heard one word about this person
5072595 i dont remember her as being very forceful or sociable
5072596 there werent a lot of people that knew her really well who are still alive
5072597 my understanding was she did some modeling in her youth
5072598 i never thought of her as the victim type or the type that would be suckered by a con man
5072599 he was fascinated with computers and electronics he was a trekkie

5072635 shouldnt we be sorting the matter of the dodgy share distribution before we do anything else
5072636 so now some people turn up who dont want their identity known but they want something we have why would i assign anything to some mystery people when there were potentially illegal activities going on in mtl manabars technologies limited
5072637 i think i would like to wait and see what pricewaterhousecoopers comes up with the shareholding issue really must be settled before anything else happens
5072638 the subsequent liquidation of mtl would support the 5 cents a share price
5072639 the identity of the investor will be made known in due course and obviously prior to any decision being finalised you are being asked to vest your ownership back to manabars ip limited to allow a significant investment to be made in the intellectual property without investment the manabars technology will not be completed
5072640 waiting for pwc will ensure nothing happens and the opportunity and your investment will be lost
5072641 with the current arrangement i dont know what i own
5072642 but i do get the feeling like i am being asked to do this vesting without knowing the full implications

5072664 while bethel community was formed with the best of intentions and has supported families for more than 25 years recent misconduct and longer term structural cultural and behaviour issues within bethel mean that the communitys ongoing existence is no longer justifiable
5072665 it is clear that a proposal to reform restructure and rebuild the community on the foundations of the old organisation which had been under consideration is untenable particularly as aspects and physical reminders of the old organisation are a continuing source of some considerable pain to former members of the community
5072666 we deeply regret that the original genuine christian mission of the community has been subverted by certain actions and activities that the remaining members of the community find totally unacceptable and do not condone

5072680 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5072681 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5072682 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5072683 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5072684 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5072685 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5072686 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5072691 the cdr began to install the lines but stopped due to earlier protests we were therefore surprised to see workers from electricite du liban resuming work on the lines on saturday
5072692 was surprised to learn that work on the lines in mansourieh had resumed the ministers office wants to clarify that it is the cdr that is responsible for this project but he will take the residents protests into consideration and upon his return to lebanon will contact the prime minister and other officials in order to facilitate a solution to the problem
5072693 the investigation into the bombing has begun and there are many interpretations political interpretations
5072694 once again they want our country to be an arena for settling scores and battling for influence
5072695 feared that the spate of bloody violence in tripoli could spread to ain al hilweh and the bekaa

5072699 our relation with our brothers in the future movement will not be affected by signing this understanding we assure everybody that the sunnis will remain united
5072700 we hope the release will help strengthen the peace process
5072701 president mahmoud abbas had requested the release of very large numbers of prisoners eventually leading to the release of all palestinian prisoners from israeli jails
5072702 whoever engages in dialogue with israel can be boosted through dialogue and not the use of force

5072704 det gik skidegodt og det var lige hvad vi havde brug for

5072715 on monday its richard dawkinss turn yet again to take up the cudgels against religious faith in a two part channel 4 programme the root of all evil
5072716 behind unsubstantiated assertions sweeping generalisations and random anecdotal evidence theres the unmistakable whiff of panic they fear religion is on the march again
5072717 theres an aggrieved frustration that theyve been short changed by history we were supposed to be all atheist rationalists by now
5072718 theres an underlying anxiety that atheist humanism has failed over the 20th century atheist political regimes racked up an appalling and unmatched record for violence
5072719 this is the only context that can explain dawkinss programme
5072720 sadly there is no evolution of thought in dawkinss position he has been saying much the same thing about religion for a long time
5072721 first dawkins is featured in jerusalem the point is that religion causes violence

5072724 to go out there and do that against that type of team is definitely encouraging
5072725 i had no idea until just recently that i started that hot guys were getting open
5072726 you can always get better theres not a lot of perfect games out there so if you think youve arrived youre going to be embarrassed pretty quickly
5072727 but i was pleased with the way he played today against an excellent defense
5072728 i thought i was gone i dont know what he did he dove
5072729 unbelievable it felt good to get the interception but it felt bad to get tackled
5072730 im not going to hear the end of this until the end of my career
5072731 theyre going to let me have it all day every day
5072732 i know id be the first one to jump in someones face
5072733 i probably need two or three to make this one go away
5072734 im not worried about preseason i have to check the record but i think we might have won super bowls and won one game in preseason
5072735 i dont get too excited about the score i get excited about effort im not sure of a lack of effort out there at all by anybody im seeing individual hustle and i like the way the offense is playing and i saw our offensive line do some good things tonight
5072736 he was sitting on everything so i told jay when we go against pacman im running a double move
5072737 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
5072738 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
5072739 my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
5072740 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5072741 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5072742 everybody knows that if we keep on going on the same track that were going that we are giving our wealth away were funding both sides in the war on terror
5072743 were going to be over the long term putting enormous pressure on ordinary families here in america who just arent going to be able to afford skyrocketing gasoline prices and home heating prices so this is one of those issues that i think should unify the country thats what were going to be talking about
5072744 were growing up now jonny we say train into th city suzie reported that mommy potty trained her sister and teacher answered were growing up now we say go to the bathroom
5072745 well my mom and i read whinnie the the the shit
5072746 why some social network services work and others dont or the case for object centered sociality
5072747 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5072748 why do we see a difference between the objects hitting the ground and the big objects whizzing by
5072749 we finally had a big enough data set that the statistics demanded an answer it could no longer be just a coincidence
5072750 we think the yarkovsky effect is so efficient for meter size objects that it can operate on all regions of the asteroid belt
5072751 odds are an object we might have to deal with would be like an ll chondrite and thanks to our samples in the laboratory we can measure its properties in detail
5072752 todays filing is a huge step in the right direction for justice for nbfa members
5072753 we will continue to host meetings around the country until every eligible black farmer is represented by our legal team
5072754 it is my personal commitment that no late filer is left behind and it is vitally important for all black farmers to act swiftly by obtaining counsel now
5072755 we have intelligence reports confirming iranian sponsored groups are planning to return back to iraq and are targeting specific coalition forces isf iraqi security forces and iraqi citizens
5072756 and they are taking the lead in handling the situation
5072757 they are being trained by quds force under the leadership of qassim suleimani and lebanese hizbullah
5072758 we are coordinating our efforts with egyptian prime minister ahmad nazif and the relevant ministers in egypt in order to enable egyptian electricity and gas to reach lebanon as soon as possible
5072759 our aim is to provide top elegance to ladies who care about fashion
5072760 people who rent cars are mainly gulf arabs and lebanese who visit lebanon frequently
5072761 the summer of 2008 is good and people are optimistic
5072762 reservations in the hotel are increasing due to the hot season which started a few days ago the actual summer season period is 45 days long between july 20 and august 25
5072763 at least we can stay outdoors in the middle of the day with no heat burning our skin
5072764 the doha agreement of may couldnt have come sooner giving aley a chance to spend its summers doing what it does best attracting tourists
5072765 the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in 2005 the summer 2006 war with israel the battles in nahr al bared in 2007 the explosions and the strike in downtown beirut were all fundamental reasons for completely calling off the whole summer vacation
5072766 our biggest fear was the possibility of losing our standing as a major resort after a summer season is repeatedly lost people search for an alternative but summer 2008 has helped maintain this standing
5072767 competition does not exist in aley resorts and the neighboring area
5072768 and any success achieved here serves the country as a whole
5072769 there is no such notion anymore in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5072770 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5072771 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbor and is now paying the price
5072772 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5072773 serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union
5072774 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5072775 we are here to protect the people and stop looting
5072776 all the roads are free for humanitarian aid and georgians
5072777 the charge sheet will be presented in parliament by tuesday
5072778 time has come when the nation will decide its own destiny as the people voted for a change in the country in the february elections
5072779 whether he quits or counters the impeachment move will be decided after he sees the charges
5072780 the emissaries of musharraf are still in contact with the government and as far as we know musharrafs aides are advising him either to resign seeking an assurance for indemnity or try the supreme court
5072781 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5072782 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5072783 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5072784 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5072785 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5072786 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5072787 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5072788 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5072789 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5072790 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5072791 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5072792 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5072793 international requests when you ask someone from another country if theyre willing to send you a book its a common sight to have the book mooched by someone else while that email request gets answered ill say more about this scenario in the next blog posting
5072794 elite reserved for class personally if i am adding a book i want a fmily m ember to mooch i let them know before i add it to my inventory and then they tell me when theyll be online to mooch it that way they can mooch it immediately and no one lese goes through the frustration of being notified that a much desired book is available only to have it turn out that psych
5072795 it is so dissapointing to get an email about a book on my wishlist only to find there are no copies available
5072796 sorry you are not listed as one of my friends
5072797 so for now no change to how wishlist notifications work but if it becomes a common source of complaints ill revisit this
5072798 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5072799 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5072800 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5072801 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5072802 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5072803 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5072804 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it
5072805 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5072806 i walked in there and i fell it was dark and i didnt know when i was going to stop

5072815 daniel will feel just great being treated like everybody else for the first time in his life he is going to the same school as his brother william age 9 this increase in self esteem by itself might ease daniels transition into a normal setting
5072816 daniels speech problems are so great that we cannot understand him some of the time how is he going to survive in the schoolyard
5072817 several years ago i coached a soccer team that daniel and william were both on we all tried hard to include daniel but he just couldnt play at age level he would just stand there he ended up getting frustrated throwing all the balls down the hill and pulling his pants down he did not make a lot of friends
5072818 weve fought for the last two years all the way to federal district court to keep the school district from sending daniel to a

5072821 es de vital importancia revisar y reorganizar la estructura org nica de la sspdf redefinir reas con respecto a su operatividad mando y subordinaci n
5072822 analizar y en su caso congregar en una sola las reas donde existe duplicidad de funciones ya que esto provoca adem s justificaci n de omisiones con dispendio de recursos humanos log sticos y financieros

5072827 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5072828 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in the future
5072829 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5072830 the iranian media is mistaken it was the launch of a rocket capable of carrying a satellite the omid satellite was not launched itself
5072831 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under sanctions by the west and the security council making it develop the technology and build all parts and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5072832 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians

5072838 the iraqi government will not allow any security company to have immunity in iraq

5072841 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
5072842 the apparent lack of interest from the united states fortifies our conclusion that the case does not yet present a political question
5072843 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
5072844 100 billion is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
5072845 i think advocates of unaccountable privatization are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatization of war making on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances of contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness
5072846 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
5072847 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
5072848 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
5072849 there was collaboration between baghdad police and neighboring provinces of kerbala there were special forces from the interior ministry who also took part
5072850 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of saddams regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach kerbala
5072851 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to kerbala from baghdad
5072852 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
5072853 jag k nner f rakt f r dessa d rar
5072854 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5072855 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5072856 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5072857 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5072858 we also had a great church and when you give up your church your pastor and the community you are involved in youre making a big sacrifice lets face it hollywood is a completely different environment than franklin tennessee
5072859 its way too hot out here for human life give me the air conditioner

5072935 we have told the court we will announce within 45 days the new location of migron
5072936 the government caved in to settlers who threatened to use violence if they are evacuated while they illegally occupy private palestinian land
5072937 the thought of evacuating migron is against the torah and basic human morals
5072938 migron was erected in a fraudulent manner on private land taken from palestinians the same settlers who violated the law are now seeing their actions sanctioned by the law

5072943 i was asked to comment as an astronomer to an ast

5072957 you pound the strike zone just pound it they do more picking at the zone than getting after hitters sometimes
5072958 they need to get back to attacking that strike zone
5072959 thats the only way you can pitch to be successful if you look at in the long term you pitch to guys not away
5072960 we just have to have that mindset that were going to go in throw down over the plate and let them hit it my defense will help i think thats the best formula in the long haul you win
5072961 we struggled a bit in the second half but we managed to keep our lead
5072962 we were solid defensively but the most important thing is to win games

5072975 the consolidation of ownership among video distributors who own both the networks and content could create roadblocks of discrimination towards their own products or for the products of major media corporations with considerable market clout
5072976 the ip multicast model requires a great deal more state inside the network than the ip unicast model of best effort delivery does and this has been the cause of some criticism also no mechanism has yet been demonstrated that would allow the ip multicast model to scale to millions of senders and millions of multicast groups and thus it is not yet possible to make fully general multicast applications practical in the commercial internet
5072977 multicast by its very nature is not a connection oriented mechanism so protocols such as tcp which allows for retransmission of missing packets are not appropriate for applications such as streaming audio and video the occasional dropped packet is not a problem but for distribution of critical data a mechanism is required for requesting retransmission
5072978 independent groups like the internet protocol multicast standards initiative ipmsi have claimed that the lack of a truly scalable secure reliable ip multicast protocol like the proposed smart multicast smart secure multicast for advanced repeating of television have hampered the adoption of ip multicast in inter domain routing the lack of a widely adopted system that has aes level security and scalable reliability have kept mass media transmissions of sporting events like the super bowl and or breaking news events from being transmitted on the public internet

5073034 neither kwiatkowski nor the fellow employee had any idea what prompted wonders comments
5073035 a short time later plaintiff said that as wonder passed him in the hallway coming back from the conference room he heard her call him a stupid fag under her breath
5073036 one of his fellow employees observed his reaction of utter shock as he came back to his desk plaintiff claimed that after work that day as he went out to his car his knees buckled he started to hyperventilate and he no longer felt safe speaking to anyone at work
5073037 we do not believe that the calendars offensiveness rose to the necessary level of severity to make a reasonable homosexual person believe that the terms and conditions of the workplace had been altered
5073038 plaintiff argues that this comment made to him as a gay man was the equivalent of the jungle bunny comment made to the african american plaintiff in taylor which the n j supreme court found sufficient to form the basis for a hostile work environment claim
5073039 the patent offensiveness of the stupid fag comment renders it quite similar to the comment made to the plaintiff in taylor
5073040 she was treating him more harshly than his prior supervisors had and that she did not like him
5073041 given that environment hearing his supervisor refer to him in a patently offensive way could have reasonably led him to believe that the terms and conditions of his employment had indeed changed at the very least plaintiff would have had genuine reason to question wonder every time she criticized his work and evaluated his performance and to wonder whether the criticism was valid or instead was generated by her bias against gay men
5073042 was not so extreme and outrageous as to go beyond all bounds of decency in a civilized society
5073043 it has been recognized that employees are entitled to greater protection than strangers from insults and that employers have a greater duty than strangers to avoid inflicting emotional distress thus an employers position of authority and the abuse of the employer employee relationship can contribute to a finding of extreme and outrageous conduct
5073044 whether an employee had a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress where one of her co workers in the presence of her supervisor and another co worker said to her your boss said youd give him a blow job and the other co worker added yeah and he said we can watch
5073045 although admittedly the comment was made under plaintifs supervisors breath and not in the presence of anyone else it was said in anger and was entirely offensive moreover plaintiffs psychiatrist stated the effects that such a comment had on plaintiff as a gay man and the severe stress it caused him
5073046 is considered an act of generosity the deceased and his her surviving relatives are providing food to sustain living beings

5073052 als we niet uitkijken dan doen we wat in de tweede wereldoorlog met de joden is gebeurd langzamerhand lijkt het alsof er geen grenzen zijn voor het beledigen van deze groep
5073053 de afgelopen jaren hebben veel mensen zich ingezet voor het organiseren van gesprekken en ontmoetingen tussen groepen met verschillende culturele achtergronden om de kloven te overbruggen
5073054 enkele gespreksdeelnemers zijn gevlucht voor de politieke islam en nu in nederland voelen ze zich opeens gedwongen om zich achter de islam te scharen of ze nu praktiserend zijn of niet er is sprake van dubbele loyaliteit natuurlijk zijn ze blij met alle verworvenheden van de nederlandse staat waar de positie van vrouwen goed is en waar je kunt zeggen wat je wilt maar de islam wordt nu zo slecht afgeschilderd dat ook dat niet eerlijk is zo wordt je toch gedwongen om op te komen voor je geloof of de cultuur waarin je bent opgegroeid

5073294 the word of russian president dmitry medvedev needs to be upheld by his forces people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5073295 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5073296 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave

5073309 the practice of morality being necessary for the well being of society he god has taken care to impress its precepts so indelibly on our hearts that they shall not be effaced by the subtleties of our brain we all agree in the obligation of the moral precepts of jesus and nowhere will they be found delivered in greater purity than in his discourses

5073311 in this apologia for christian faith keller mines material from literary classics philosophy anthropology and a multitude of other disciplines to make an intellectually compelling case for god written for skeptics and the believers who love them the book draws on the authors encounters as founding pastor of new yorks booming redeemer presbyterian church one of kellers most provocative arguments is that all doubts however skeptical and cynical they may seem are really a set of alternate beliefs drawing on sources as diverse as 19th century author robert louis stevenson and contemporary new testament theologian n t wright keller attempts to deconstruct everyone he finds in his way from the evolutionary psychologist richard dawkins to popular author dan brown the first shorter part of the book looks at popular arguments against gods existence while the second builds on general arguments for god to culminate in a sharp focus on the redemptive work of god in christ kellers condensed summaries of arguments for and against theism make the scope of the book overwhelming at times nonetheless it should serve both as testimony to the authors encyclopedic learning and as a compelling overview of the current debate on faith for those who doubt and for those who want to re evaluate what they believe and why
5073312 is how we live connected to something that has been in place since the beginning of time maybe jesus didnt come to start a new religion but to show us how to live in tune with the life god has always planned for us

5073314 our moral language assumes a universality we do not believe
5073315 no one can deny that our culture is opposed to christian values and the influences bombarding our childrens moral development can be deadly but few parents and church leaders realize how critical it is to start developing a childs biblical worldview from the very earliest years of life the problem is complex parents who themselves did not receive early spiritual training leave their childrens training to the church yet the church often focuses on older children not realizing that a childs moral development is set by the age of nine

5073319 power all sexual abuse is first and foremost an abuse of power it is an abuse of power in a sexual form unhealthy ideas concerning power and its exercise are always relevant to the question of abuse spiritual power is arguably the most dangerous power of all in the wrong hands it gives the power to make judgements even about the eternal fate of another person it needs a sign on it at all times saying handle with extreme care the greater the power a person exercises the more need there is for checks and balances before it is used and accountability after it is used if the governing image of how to act as a priest or religious is tied to the idea of lordship and control then no matter how benevolently ministry is carried out an unhealthy domination and subservience will be present the worst case is that of the messiah complex when a person believes that god is calling him or her to be as it were a messiah a chosen one who is called to some special mission and is therefore above the rules that apply to ordinary mortals including the moral rules in such cases if sexual abuse does not occur some other form of abusive behaviour will

5073355 i have basically excluded natural causes and i would think it is highly unlikely that the death of this man is accidental which leaves us with two other options those being a homicide or a suicide
5073356 we are dealing with it as a homicide until we can work out that it is not
5073357 the gentleman is probably best described as a homeless transient and we are struggling a bit to find his next of kin so that could take a little while
5073358 i dont want to comment on exactly what hes been up to in the past but at this stage he hasnt come to our attention for quite a few years
5073359 we do not know what happened or where this happened so we are basically trying to search any area around here until we find out where hes actually been

5073364 there were so many songs that it seemed wrong to leave anything out
5073365 and to put it all on one cd and make you have to listen to something for way too long i mean its like listen to the first cd its about 30 minutes and if you want to listen to the other one cool it just made sense
5073366 one of the curiosities on the show was that the oldest person in town who was the chauffeur for the first person who got the disease he didnt get sick which is unusual because usually if youre that old he was i think close to 90 you get sick
5073367 as other people started getting sick they asked him if he could donate some of his blood so they could recover antibodies that might help his wife and other people from the town who had gotten sick
5073368 since i saw the show i thought this is such a great idea why dont we just do it in real life
5073369 we had thought about this before but considered it impossible
5073370 we actually had to find the cells floating around in the blood as if they were sentinels looking for a new infection
5073371 suggests that its possible to make a strong immune response in humans to these types of bird flu viruses
5073372 if you take the cells that make these antibodies and you can treat them in a way to allow them to grow in culture dishes for a long period of time you can then isolate those antibodies and use those antibodies to treat somebody with a severe infection
5073373 our enemies who had once dropped bombs on us were now bringing us food and coal to heat our homes with

5073385 weve got one in the top 50 to go through to the next round and one just outside
5073386 going last matt had all the pressure on him but he handled it brilliantly for a young guy we are very happy
5073387 you definitely needed a horse with good eyesight on this track
5073388 you need to jump the first part as if its a fence on its own and then push on for the second two elements if you go in too forward there you are going to have some part of it down the course is very technical and very light you have to concentrate all the way
5073389 its not like we are not used to pressure its just a big surprise here today
5073390 we had a plan that we would use the first competition to train a bit the other day it wasnt that we didnt take it seriously but maybe we didnt get that right
5073391 we are going to have to go back and sit together and discuss what has happened its certainly not what we expected
5073392 well set but when i walked it i thought 50 of horses will jump into the water there is almost a 90 degree turn there and at the triple at the end you need to jump in short weve only seen one clear so far its a good fair course but we will have to prepare for the second round tomorrow if we get into the top eight teams tonight if we do get through we wont be giving up we will come out fighting
5073393 i hope the rest of the team has good fortune
5073394 its not easy out there only two clears so far but weve been building for this for over a year now with a great back up team weve sacrificed a lot and we will be disappointed if we go home without a medal the olympic games is all about peaking at the right time sapphire was less sensitive today and she went great
5073395 were not sure whats wrong he may be tied up but he couldnt jump like that john is really very disappointed
5073396 our first two riders didnt have a good day today but they will clean up their act tomorrow so see you on the podium
5073397 if he gets an insect in his ear he goes crazy and he started waving his head and didnt even see the fence
5073398 well we havent actually had a bad season at all
5073399 we were second in la baule and second again at st gallen and we havent always been in a position to use our best horses and our best riders but weve worked very hard to prepare for coming here
5073400 this is a nations cup anything can happen and we are only halfway tonight
5073401 but tomorrow is another day and another course lets wait and see
5073402 he started the piaffe really good i had no feeling that he was not going to do it so i was really surprised because i could see no reason for it to happen
5073403 hes a bit of a genius and so sometimes little things disturb him
5073404 and we have to remember that these are animals so anything can happen
5073405 it was a stupid thing and it never happened in training
5073406 maybe sometimes you want to go so well and maybe you are a bit on the edge but my horse is very fit and fresh and i was trying to go for the best test and thats a positive
5073407 to do his best he must not be put under any pressure and tonight he was really forward and responsive
5073408 we talked together in the stables about how we would do things he speaks german you see so he understands me very well
5073409 a lot of the test comes from inside him from his mind as well as his body you cannot achieve anything by putting pressure on him
5073410 when i came out from the prize giving on thursday night i thought i could feel something strange in the way she was moving but then she seemed to be ok again she was excited in the ring with all the noise and everything but i cant say i remember anything happening in there so i was surprised yesterday we looked at her again and there was still a problem it is in her front leg she is uneven in her movement but im hoping she will recover quickly
5073411 i warmed up in my top hat and jacket and i think i just over heated and i didnt know what i was doing when i was in the ring
5073412 my horse is naturally very extravagant and i thought he did a really nice test im thrilled to come back into the ring and pull off a big performance it was good for me and good for my horse too
5073413 i had more horse today than i had in the grand prix and i have plenty of horse left for the freestyle
5073414 its the worst score i have ever had with him
5073415 i had problems with the contact and we had a lot of mistakes it was a bad day for us what can i say

5073417 we have problems because we are not doing things that in my opinion we have to do in terms of signing players
5073418 the question is that we have to be quicker and i told them these things four years ago and i continue thinking the same
5073419 we do not know if he barry is coming but he is definitely a really good player
5073420 the manager does not discuss those things with me he certainly does not look upset to me over it but was preparing us for a really important game and i think that were getting the results he wants
5073421 fernando is a top quality player and for me hes the best striker in the world
5073422 if youre speaking about a real striker hes the pinnacle
5073423 today was a great start for him but theres a long long season ahead i was a bit surprised ashley young wasnt in the england squad but the two of them have got plenty of time
5073424 we just have to pick ourselves up and go again
5073425 they had weapons from the russians now they are looting the village
5073426 when you are sitting in a cellar under fire it makes no difference to you who is bombing you you have no idea mainly people were hoping that the russians would come and get us out we just wanted to survive
5073427 the georgians started it but then ours began bombing too
5073428 we were two and half days in the bunker without food by the end there were more than 100 people in the bunker with us dead people lay there it was a living hell
5073429 we had to fight there was no other way to defend ourselves
5073430 many of my friends died they were hitting us with grad rockets from the hills it was like fighting against a shadow
5073431 they were shelling us from all sides and this was the response
5073432 why did saakashvili do this why did they bomb my city just because i am ossetian they promised us they would not fire and then they attacked the city

5073435 sometimes you have to be brave when everybody says he is not good
5073436 he looks intelligent he looks capable of good acceleration he sees a good vision of the game and that left flank suits him well
5073437 there were not that many problems for me to adapt to playing in england when i met the boss he said maybe i would need a bit of time maybe up to six months but i felt good straight away
5073438 there was a bit more contact than in france but the main change was the intensity of the game and how quick the 90 minutes actually goes
5073439 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides
5073440 we have to get behind him every player needs to feel wanted
5073441 ive worked hard in the summer and lost weight im more than willing to do that to prove im fitter stronger and a better player
5073442 for what he does theres nobody like him he proved it over the two games he played for england with michael owen last season he came back in and was magnificent
5073443 if you look at successful teams in the second division over a couple of years with some exceptions they can lose 10 or 11 matches and still get promoted so much depends on how you respond to defeat but with the transfer window still open we remain vulnerable if a premier club decides its short in its squad
5073444 he gives us quality on the right wing he has something and hes had six months to learn the way we do things
5073445 zenit will not sell for a penny less than 25 million euros and tottenham will not go above 22 million
5073446 im sure the chairman will decide soon if he stays or if he goes
5073447 tottenham need to make big signings to appease the fans
5073448 but they need time to adapt you saw that today with giovanni an excellent player
5073449 cd sales were down down 17 last year but vinyl sales were up by 36 over the same period
5073450 i am indebted to the lights of broadway to you to the skies of bagdadi to the red army to the cherry trees of japan to everything about which i have not yet written
5073451 i said in the summer that i needed to get five players it could now be six or seven making signings was of a priority at the end of last season and that hasnt changed
5073452 in truth i dont know whether many of the kids are ready
5073453 all the crap weve had to suffer over the last two weeks weve dispelled in 90 minutes of football at goodison park that makes it more sweet for me
5073454 no chance because he has seen the bad times here
5073455 what we need to do as a club is evolve
5073456 weve got to bring in players to give us that bit of experience that were lacking especially down the spine of the team

5073489 whether its in baseball hockey soccer tennis or any other sports that involves a ball there is a feeling of immense satisfaction and pride that comes from hitting the ball solidly nowhere does this apply more than in golf where the small ball goes where it wants on anything but a solid shot if you want to hit the ball solidly on a consistent basis the only way is through practice and more practice though you may not think so the best time to practice is right after a round everything that didnt work for you during the round is fresh in your mind and your body and mind are ready to go failure to work consistently on the shots that regularly give you the most trouble means your game wont soon improve the key to maximizing your efficiency in practice is creating real situations ideally you would mirror what happened in your round and employ your best swings also work on hitting balls from every bad lie you can think of obviously its extra important to practice if you havent played for a while boost your game further by visualizing a round of golf during lunch or breaks on your way to or home from work etc imagine taking many good swings and hitting a great shot each time see your entire body flowing in unison through each shot completely tension free this isnt useless preparation you are increasing your muscle memory and preparing them for the next round if you enjoy other sports you can transfer movements in these sports to help your golf game for instance the way you shift your weight on a tennis backhand shot is very similar to the bodyweight transfer on a golf shot use the tennis experience to remember what you need to do on the links for detailed steps on how to swing properly we suggest you pick up a copy of the golf beginner guide its a 272 page ebook full of great advice tips and lessons in golf when youre hitting a lot of balls in one session remember to take a break between swings you will avoid mental and physical exhaustion and can use the time to process what youve learned or accomplished remember youre not out there to hit a thousand shots rather a few beautiful ones hitting 20 30 balls at a time is sufficient practice especially if the majority of these are struck on the sweet spot of the clubface to hit a more accurate shot and promote better contact pull out your favorite iron and try this exercise take two tees and stick them in the ground a couple of inches apart you can also use two balls try air swinging your iron through the tees without hitting them start with partial swings and work your way up to full swings as you get better at avoiding the tees soon you will be hitting the ball more solidly it may sound corny but dont forget the feeling of a good shot memorize it and internalize it then practice it and you will soon be able to produce it consistently its very easy to lose the feeling of a great shot because there are so many variables that went into hit from hand position proper grip and good pre swing body alignment to the right ball position clubface impact and follow through

5073500 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5073501 i just dont want to splash the water on him yet you know what i mean
5073502 heres the thing hes had great vision hes made some heads up plays and weve had success i really like all that maybe i want more but i want better technique i want him to use the kind of techniques that are going to take him further down the road remember we were talking differently last week after the buffalo game oh colt came down to earth well now hes in outer space again
5073503 hes having fun but theres a lot more distance that he has to go he shouldnt be strutting his stuff
5073504 the skins trailed 7 3 at the half and then the teams exchanged field goals in a sloppy second half making it 10 6 then with just over two minutes to play brennan woke up new york and then proceeded to light it up on the first play of the drive brennan completed a 37 yard pass to billy mcmullen into jets territory three plays later he avoided the blitz and completed a pass to tight end jason goode who took it 33 yards for the score
5073505 the preseason means nothing to the fans but colt brennan may be proving something to the redskins management however the best passer in college football history will need to prove himself against tougher defenses this season i expect brennan to take some snaps early this season and possibly even starting at the end of the season if the redskins clinch a spot or are eliminated from playoff contention altogether

5073529 its hard for me to criticise my side because we did so much so right
5073530 we have just got to make sure that we are not one of those teams that plays good football and loses games which i dont think we will be
5073531 i dont think there are many teams that will come to exeter and take all three points over the season especially if they play the way they did today with the spirit and the passing they have got
5073532 but we matched them for attitude for work ethic we didnt play as well as we can but at this moment in time i am not really bothered about that its about getting three points
5073533 its a big result because it now means we have played two league games and won both
5073534 every time he would get to bat it would just blow up but it hasnt this time

5073609 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5073610 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5073611 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5073612 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead he said
5073613 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself

5073618 thats their strategy and they do it every four years and then you end up with what weve got right now i have news for john mccain my plans not gonna bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster from john mccains president george w bush and we cant afford another four years or eight years of george bush policies and thats why we are gonna beat john mccain in this election to put america on a new path
5073619 now everything that he talks about is how much he suffered he was the fattest prisoner that got off the plane
5073620 respectfully im gonna disagree with you when it comes to mccain and his service i think his policies are terrible i think his service was honorable and i think he deserves respect for that
5073621 but i think your general point about his policies though are absolutely right i mean look john mccain wants to present himself as a maverick right he always says im a maverick im a maverick im a maverick let me tell you something every single one of his top people are all lobbyists for the very special interests that have been dominating washington all these years

5073653 we might find another place with good services but nowhere will have the same homely atmosphere and beautiful architecture as walimet wardeh
5073654 dalal came and told me she was going to visit her friend at the ghazi hospital in sabra she gave me a framed photograph of herself which was odd i said to her why are you giving me a picture of yourself when i have the real thing i felt something was strange about the situation
5073655 a few days later many people came knocking at our door journalists came wanting to know what the mother of dalal was like what kind of house she had lived in i didnt know what had happened
5073656 hizbullah actually asked us in 2000 whether we wanted dalals body to be brought back to lebanon but we said no we wanted dalal to stay in palestine because she loved and died for her country she went there to fight for the palestinian people for their rights and for palestinian children we are proud of what she did for her country
5073657 we are so glad she is coming back now dalal was both palestinian and lebanese she belonged to both countries as a mother i will be very happy to have dalal so near me after all this time i think it is what dalal would have wanted too
5073658 we are happy because after 30 years we have started to talk again about dalal about the palestinians we will have a big wedding for her when she returns although she was never married dalal had thousands of children
5073659 we dont understand how she got involved in the resistance which is mainly a male domain
5073660 we live in a building among lebanese people not in the palestinian refugee camps we just dont understand how she who was a smart thoughtful and helpful girl got involved she taught many girls that they can fight for their countries
5073661 every time people come asking about dalal i remember something new from the past
5073662 right now i can remember dalal sitting in the garden smoking behind her fathers back she looked lost in thought when i asked her what she was thinking about she said nothing but i sensed she was thinking about something important
5073663 tagged as commercial art since its inception graphic design is neither art nor advertising it stands on the fine line between information sending and receiving and acts upon the human need to visualize ones thoughts a graphic designers role lies in the visual exploration of the intellect
5073664 there is more interest in graphic design now but the older generations also misunderstand what graphic design is they fail to appreciate the power of a poster and the message of a graphic designer we are responsible for the relation between text and images and how we promote our ideas to the community we live in i think its underestimated as a field in the arab world
5073665 with the current endeavour to build cities and islands and whatnot in the arabian desert the need to identify and brand different stakeholders has never been more pressing and as a result graphic designers are in high demand in the region
5073666 by its geographical location at the edge of the mediterranean and open to the arab world lebanon has long played the role of a membrane between its neighbors on the left and on the right
5073667 as such graphic design students in lebanon are also key players in this sense having been brought up and fed with media from all kinds of provenance their visual output is very much a reflection of this blend proposing a heterogeneous outlook on the city a collective memory and morale
5073668 many arab students of graphic design come to lebanon to be inspired beirut is a cosmopolitan place and that is an important ingredient for graphic design
5073669 its a way to express yourself without anyone being able to interfere its the way in which you can communicate on different levels to different audiences
5073670 its not a competitive major but more collaborative and we have all worked together as students graphic design is a good career and the field will continue to grow
5073671 at one point approximately a dozen individuals i understand basically young men started throwing some stones at the vehicles i think the assumption was that they were in some way shape or form hizbullah supporters but i dont think anybody stopped and asked them
5073672 it was a challenge for us to do something that could be heard and felt by everybody
5073673 pop music nowadays has a bad image as being commercial and there is definitely a lot of very bad music on the radio but i think pop is something to respect because it is expressive music that can be shared
5073674 and that would speak to people of different ages backgrounds and cultures
5073675 i just felt that aesthetically french didnt go with that type of music
5073676 we are using western influenced music to create something very lebanese
5073677 the trouble here may help us on an inspirational level
5073678 but it limits us in whole other ways there are very few places where we can play and were not interested in playing at the same places to the same crowd all the time
5073679 every time we work on something boom there is a bomb a catastrophe or something
5073680 we like to be rare on stage but when we do play gigs we want them to be big and intense

5073687 women themselves are not eager or willing to stand for political office
5073688 women view politics as a dirty game and their loftier standards may keep them away from the grit and grind of it
5073689 my message to you is that you cannot wait until the system is no longer corrupt because it is your participation that is going to clean it up
5073690 you cannot wait until the political system welcomes you because it is not going to you have to force your way in it wont be easy your families will pressure you to quit and you will doubt yourself but you have to push past all that

5073760 a lot of previous research has indicated the severity of mental health issues on college campuses has been increasing not decreasing and when you look at the lifetime prevalence rates those are alarming statistics
5073761 most people in university environments dont really appreciate how much suicidality students engage in they only see the high profile examples but they dont see the everyday anguish students are going though
5073762 whats my secret i may look tough on the outside but really i scream like a girl
5073763 it doesnt seem to be connected with the next line gardeners might call this a damper

5073766 the power of that story is not getting weaker through the years but actually getting stronger that ultimate spirit of freedom will last longer than the strengths of the tanks and machine guns in the long frame of history its human freedom courage dignity and that will stay and prevail that picture will testify that forever
5073767 as an ordinary chinese who respects and seeks human rights i really cannot understand or accept the linkage of human rights and 2008 olympic games i cannot but say that i am very disappointed with spielbergs behaviour he has abused his own influence has hurt hundreds of millions of chinese in the face of this kind of ignorant person i can only express loathing and contempt
5073768 we enthusiastically welcome the worlds athletes to come and compete in china
5073769 we hope they can interact with the people of china we hope they have a happy time in china i believe the people of the world are kind hearted
5073770 if the world truly wanted to place the olympics above politics the summer games would always be held in greece where they began there would be no playing of national anthems at awards ceremonies no nation by nation medals counts published
5073771 you shouldnt work on a because b also needs to be worked on
5073772 it is the silence of good people that allows evil to run rampant

5073775 the games will not be called off no country will stay away theres no chance of that and were not suggesting it athletes will not lose their chance to gain fame in 2008
5073776 the games will not be called off no country will stay away theres no chance of that and were not suggesting it athletes will not lose their chance to gain fame in 2008 but the audiences could be far short of what the chinese authorities hope for that is what they fear
5073777 we are just talking but we dont have the real action to boycott this olympic game what is your plan i seriously want to take part in
5073778 blow the bastards that is the chinese and russians off the face of the earth
5073779 most of the chinese competitors fully displayed their abilities to realize the goal of achieving good results on home soil
5073780 we are especially pleased by our athletes in judo shooting and weightlifting but every single medal is meaningful in its own way and won through painstaking efforts by our athletes
5073781 generally speaking chinese athletes are not strong contenders in many events in the second half of the games

5073788 because religion exists it must have value to someone or something
5073789 because religion exists it must have value to religious people
5073790 only 42 percent of those surveyed said they believed in darwins theory
5073791 the god delusion is smart compassionate and true like ice like fire if this book doesnt change the world were all screwed
5073792 do you believe humans evolved from a different species due to gene mutations and survival of the fittest
5073793 do you believe that the genes in bacteria mutate and we must adjust antibiotics to counteract these mutations
5073794 i have maybe ill placed a foreboding of an america in my childrens generation or my grandchildrens generation when all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries when were a service and information processing economy when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few and no one representing the public interest even grasps the issues when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or even to knowledgeably question those who do set the agendas when there is no practice in questioning those in authority when clutching our crystals and religiously consulting our horoscopes our critical faculties in steep decline unable to distinguish between whats true and what feels good we slide almost without noticing into superstition and darkness
5073795 for rewards that include a variety of merchandise and gift certificates
5073796 how you answer this question will tell us everything we need to know about you do you believe every word of this book this book that i am holding in my hand do you believe this book
5073797 the tendency to believe in religion because religion exploits several other more basic human primate traits
5073798 its the word of revelation to us from god himself the bible is a revelation of an infinite god and no finite person is ever going to fully understand it
5073799 do you believe humans evolved from a different species due to gene mutations and survival of the fittest
5073800 do you believe that the genes in bacteria mutate and we must adjust antibiotics to counteract these mutations
5073801 its the word of revelation to us from god himself the bible is a revelation of an infinite god and no finite person is ever going to fully understand it
5073802 oh those athiests are too rude and militant i think ill go join a group thats more tolerant lets see here w we west aha westboro baptist church these people sound like an open minded bunch
5073803 the united states is renowned for its excellence in scientific research
5073804 we dont have a religion we have a personal relationship with jesus christ
5073805 your life is meaningless and finite and your beliefs are sentimenal delusions
5073806 this isnt a church but we are going to use all the same claims of it solving all the worlds problems making the world a better place making people more moral etc and like all religions which this isnt only our dogma is allowed
5073807 its the word of revelation to us from god himself the bible is a revelation of an infinite god and no finite person is ever going to fully understand it
5073808 a man should not lie with a person who is a guy
5073809 as the only person here on the stage with a theology degree there are parts of it i dont fully comprehend and understand because the bible is a revelation of an infinite god and no finite person is ever going to fully understand it if they do their god is too small
5073810 beyond that i dont really know what to say or what to suggest
5073811 your life is meaningless and finite and your beliefs are sentimenal delusions
5073812 well be soft on terror because we think terrorists just need a warm hug
5073813 religion is a bad thing it encourages people to believe in things that are not true it really is as simple as that wed be better off if people valued truth over comfortable delusions
5073814 many atheists fall into the trap of pseudo religious thinking they get dogmatic schism to form sects issue fatwas excommunicate each other repeat the same logical fallacies it is amusing for a while but gets old watching fundies without jesus and yahweh when i hear people talk about stamping out religion it sounds a lot like getting out in the water and stopping the tide good luck bash away but forget the fatwas accusations of heresy and threats of excommunication after dealing with wingnut xian fundies they just go into a mental trash can
5073815 the most dangerous party member in every party there is one member who by his all too devout pronouncement of the party principles provokes the others to apostasy
5073816 however he explicitly consciously excludes america from this analysis for obvious reasons we are filthy rich compared to much of the rest of the world and were also pathologically religious
5073817 its because its becoming more dangerous and chaotic governments arent providing the services that people need and religions are again and again you hear about these so called terrorist organizations providing services for their people
5073818 your life is meaningless and finite and your beliefs are sentimenal delusions
5073819 also for many probably most people there is a sense of futility meaninglessness and despair that comes with the thought of a godless universe and no afterlife
5073820 why unconditionally value truth above all other possible values that it might come into conflict with
5073821 well all that good science education enabled the us to finish
5073822 is it all just one way to celebrate and embrace stupidity an appeal to the lowest common denominator
5073823 in 24 idlemind mentioned the protests in sudan against the teacher once again it is groups made up principally maybe entirely of young
5073824 the results today seem to show that one should be particularly wary of young men who go to churches or mosques
5073825 in case you didnt notice the guys who carried out the london and madrid attacks were not suicide bombers
5073826 the majority of americans do not think they just accept this nonsense at face value and we have to deal with stupidity on a national scale
5073827 when it comes to religion the majority of americans do not want to think they just want to accept this nonsense at face value and we have to deal with self inflicted brain damage on a national scale
5073828 there is this attitude that because something exists it must have value because people are religious it must be good for them in some way and all we have to do is look hard enough and we will find something to rationalize its existence this is not necessarily true
5073829 wilson is a smart guy but he has his eyes closed to the awful inanity of religious belief
5073830 to make sure his side of the story was heard
5073831 it is better to keep your mouth closed and have people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt
5073832 this is insane to me that i have an armed guard outside my door when ive cooperated with everything other than the whole solitary confinement in italy thing
5073833 willing to risk infecting an unknown number of strangers in order to have a nice wedding
5073834 or health care in the rest of europe for that matter really that bad compared to health care in the usa
5073835 opa ronzo opa ronzo kijk ik heb een nieuwe jurk met mickey mouse erop
5073836 zo nou dat is inderdaad een hele mooie jurk meisje echt prachtig zon jurk zou opa ronzo zelf ook wel willen hebben
5073837 maar zeg eens meisje jij lust zeker wel een lekker snoepje van opa ronzo

5073840 nietes oma missy is lief zij heeft een nieuwe jurk voor me gekocht
5073841 het is ook wel een mooie jurk maar zal ik eens een geheimpje verklappen
5073842 kom hier dan dan fluister ik het in je oor ik vind kindertjes nog veel mooier zonder jurk
5073843 maar ik vind mijn jurk mooi ik wil hem altijd aanhouden de hele vakantie elke dag
5073844 tja dat moet je natuurlijk zelf weten maar dan vindt opa ronzo je dus lelijk een vies lelijk kindje met een jurk toen opa ronzo een beetje minder oud was dan nu kwamen alle kindjes uit de buurt bij opa ronzo in de tuin spelen mooie kindjes zonder jurk
5073845 ja hoor want opa ronzo bulkt altijd van het geld ik kon wel 100 jurken betalen maar ik vind jurken jukkiebleg ik zie liever kindertjes zonder jurk
5073846 broeken zijn ook heel erg jukkiebleg kindjes met broeken zijn lelijk oh wacht daar komt opa maddog niks vertellen over ons geheimpje he opa maddog begrijpt dat niet
5073847 nou dat is een mooie jurk meisje maar vertel eens zou jij wel een lekker snoepje lusten van opa maddog
5073848 dat dacht ik wel maar dat krijg je niet want opa maddog eet alles altijd liever zelf op dus
5073849 ga je dat wijst op boodschappenmand met wieltjes afgeladen met snoep chips en koeken allemaal helemaal zelf alleen opeten opa maddog
5073850 ja dat ga ik allemaal zelf opeten maar ik moet snel weg want daar komt die vreetzak van een oma mellow aangekreukt die probeert mij altijd een gratis pak bastognekoeken af te troggelen dag kindertje dag ronzo
5073851 kindertje het lijkt mij in alle redelijkheid beter dat je nu opa ronzo met rust laat
5073852 nou niet echt lastig maar ja ze droeg wel een jurk en dan beleef ik er toch geen plezier aan
5073853 precies nou maar goed dat ik haar weggestuurd heb moet je luisteren wat ik nu weer meegemaakt heb bladibla wauwel de wauwel zwets zwets
5073854 rustig kindertje rustig nou maar grow nou eerst eens een brain en dan vertel je opa vlunk kalm wat er aan de hand is
5073855 ohhh je bent oma mellow tegen het lijf gelopen ja dat is even schrikken we kunnen beter met je langs de zusterpost even kijken of alles in orde is en of ze je niet heeft besmet met hysterische paranoia heb je je portemonneetje nog wel kindertje snik hik voelt in zakken neeeeeeeeheeeee wheeeee mijn portemonnee is weg en er zat 2 euro zakgeld in wheeee wheeee

5073857 mag ik dan na de zusterpost weer naar oma missy
5073858 ja hoor oma mellow tegenkomen is wel genoeg traumatische ervaring voor 1 dag
5073859 the first thing that pops into your head is that its bigfoot
5073860 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
5073861 is based on darrens and his partner chris personal experience building blog businesses to make 100 000 year or more
5073862 dice que siempre fui de escaparme que nunca he estado a gusto en sitios cerrados
5073863 me da su palabra de que no se fugar si le doy permiso para ir a recogerlo
5073864 el movimiento es lo que nos define no quer a hablar de un pueblo o de un lugar m tico sino de un viaje de una persona que cambia
5073865 en el avi n no ve su lengua ligada a un territorio sino que la lleva consigo la visi n cl sica ligaba las lenguas a un territorio y hay que pasar a una visi n m s m vil m s ligada al individuo
5073866 y me gusta esa manera de ser no de grupo
5073867 all es cierto uno siempre se ha definido como parte de un grupo nosotros los vascos los escritores vascos la poes a ha sido mucho de gu nosotros pero mi generaci n ha pasado a ni yo lo vemos de una manera m s natural gracias en parte al trabajo de mucha gente de atxaga por ejemplo para ellos escribir en euskera era una opci n casi ideol gica para levantarlo para nosotros es m s natural han pasado muchos a os desde el franquismo no tenemos la misi n de salvar una lengua no estamos a la defensiva
5073868 le el famoso manifiesto y creo que no se entendi bien cre demasiados rechazos en vez de plantearlo como la preocupaci n de muchos padres que quieren que sus hijos estudien en castellano una preocupaci n real y por tanto muy a tener en cuenta
5073869 no se trunquen los derechos de nadie que nadie se sienta inc modo
5073870 a m me gusta que en el pa s vasco se hablen diferentes lenguas es inherente a la forma de ser del pa s pero es importante que nadie sienta la cuesti n ling stica como una amenaza los vascohablantes hemos vivido muchos a os con la sensaci n de que nuestra lengua no ten a espacio para vivir que estaba tocada de muerte es una sensaci n que no quisiera para nadie asimismo hay gente en euskadi que siente que su forma de vivir en castellano est amenazada y es necesario que no tenga esa sensaci n que se sienta tranquila
5073871 mi abuela hablaba y le a en euskera pero a mi madre no se lo ense aron y le cost mucho llegar a leerlo aunque hablase la lengua desde peque a aprendi cumplidos los cincuenta luego vino mi generaci n educada en las dos lenguas
5073872 dejen la cuesti n ling stica fuera de la lucha partidista no hagan pol tica con las lenguas
5073873 but the words just slid off his eyes incomprehensible as meaningless and blithery as whatever was coming out of the television what the world needs not
5073874 hes still so zotzed hes going to need a past life regression therapist just to remember his name
5073875 a fish tank holding a single carp so large it couldnt turn around
5073876 a kelly green yarmulke emblazoned with the new york jets logo
5073877 seemed unbreakable as in broken so many times there was nothing left to break
5073878 what measure of justice were ultimately portioned out what memorials or scholarship funds established whatever new children would come into his life he would always carry in himself that gruelling sensation of waiting for a tranquil heart for his son to stop messing around and reappear for his own death
5073879 inside out showing the way it has been stitched together and the crude form of its construction
5073880 friendship is only that friendship there are areas of reserve and distance knowledge and experience that cannot be shared or entered into
5073881 anyone who asks such a question deserves to be lied to
5073882 he hauled it dripping from the chrome bucket it was like an ice baby being born
5073883 sometimes the most important and powerful element is an absence a lack a burnished space in your mind that glows and aches as you try to fill it
5073884 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5073885 on arrival at the scene they found both aircraft had crashed one had gone down in brandon woods unfortunately there were four people confirmed dead in the wreckage of that aircraft
5073886 the second aircraft landed in a filed near conventry road between brinklow and coventry and sadly one persons was confirmed dead at the aircraft crash site
5073887 luke has a particular energy that works very well with me
5073888 he is a very sweet guy but has this deep earnestness hes so genuinely there and very intense
5073889 even when i see footage of bros stadium shows it simply doesnt feel like me
5073890 im into all that fantasy stuff anyway and i adore the lord of the rings but the thing that i love most about our film is that while people say hellboy is just another blockbuster with loads of cash we have an academy illuminated director who used all his talents to create something quite beautiful mystical and magical
5073891 that first five years of my career was all about being viable when i was in the band
5073892 but when i did theatre in rep for 250 a week a small stage with 400 people in the audience i just realised that this made me happy
5073893 having had some fame before with bros was a real help with the acting
5073894 mainly because id learned to get over myself id done enough already to not feel like i had to prove anything to anyone that gave me a confidence not having to big myself up or to be really frenetic and in a panic to achieve especially in meetings and auditions
5073895 if you have a sense of worth whether you get the role or not you still have that when you leave the building you might feel like shit for an hour but you get over it
5073896 there is but one truth one universal soul of which we are all manifestations and whose mystery can be approached in diverse ways
5073897 what a horrid place the world was how graphic and explicit and crude
5073898 she was too pretty she looked too clean her clothes were intact their dishevelment too mannered
5073899 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

5073906 it would make the new station internationally significant and much talked about
5073907 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days

5073916 we want to bring out the pro american energy people
5073917 we are going to soon we hope separate the sheep from the goats here are you pro american energy are you anti american energy
5073918 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5073919 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5073920 but nobody has ever heard these voices but the late grand master of the descenders
5073921 in gods we trust the evolutionary landscape of religion evolution and cognition series
5073922 evolving god a provocative view on the origins of religion
5073923 god the failed hypothesis how science shows that god does not exist
5073924 no religious person actually wants there to be a naturalistic story for religion
5073925 if you could show that all apparent states of enlightenment were just a matter of reaching the relevant cycling in the brain
5073926 what if science could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that re incarnation did not exist
5073927 that would be a very difficult thing to prove though
5073928 give him some tequila and he will sing like a canarie
5073929 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5073930 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5073931 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on the 29th of march 2008
5073932 it wont last unless its a common product that is owned by this entire collective of the leadership of zimbabwe
5073933 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5073934 i based some aspects of albert jamess character on bateson
5073935 the interesting thing about him was that the more he wrote the more people started taking him to pieces he moved from interventionist biological research into non interventionist anthropology
5073936 when studying mental illness in california he would say he didnt want people to try therapy because he reached a stage where he felt that any intervention was worse than leaving things alone
5073937 and then you get him in a no win situation he was brilliant at unveiling the worlds catastrophes seeing the whole competitive thing as destructive of the planet but he thinks that if you shouldnt intervene then why did you open your mouth to say that in the first place no win
5073938 drink every evening ceremonial substitute for the thing that hasnt happened but what thing
5073939 whereas 10 years ago i might have offered advice to a friend in marriage or professional difficulties my instinct now is to listen and not influence the situation because people will do what they will do
5073940 maybe one of the characteristics of a decadent period is that the people doing a lot of thinking maybe the people who you hope would be driving a community are the people who are bowing out and saying we dont think theres much you can do about all this
5073941 so its interesting looking back at writers like d h lawrence or somebody much more difficult like nietzsche and their line was that its always better to make an adventurous mistake than not get engaged at all
5073942 its an ambiguity about how we think of the third world
5073943 half of the time were thinking we should sort the whole thing out for them and the other half were thinking its criminal that we ever got engaged with them at all
5073944 between colonialism and the charitable organisations theres an enormous amount in common that you go somewhere and do something im not really on anybodys side in that debate
5073945 you dont really know what you mean by a novel if you had a clear message there would be other ways to express it
5073946 i remember one appalling dream about being beside a river full of mutilated bodies childrens heads parts it was all so much worse than any films special effects theres a madness in taking dreams too seriously but also in ignoring them

5073948 the chorus means let it swing let it rock and roll explains the singer who records under the name ida maria then with a final slurp of the red wine she imbibes rather enthusiastically ida maria will hit the stage
5073949 these are true on one song i tried to make a backwards somersault id never done that before because i was trying to impress booking agencies in sweden and there i was on the floor and i had cracked my ribs and i couldnt move
5073950 and after id cracked my ribs we went to the studio and recorded this album with cracked ribs i think the singing would have been better though cos it was really hard to breathe i use a lot of air when i sing and it was just painful all the way
5073951 it was too boring and square and it just stands there
5073952 i defecated on the keyboard in my room when i was four because it was black and i hated black
5073953 i was bored of nesna i was bored of britney spears and i was bored of everyone and i just knew there was something else
5073954 i was quite obsessed with the fact that you only see naked girls everywhere
5073955 i have nothing against some boobs but i wanted to write a song where the man was the object
5073956 you need pain to feel happiness its not about being a self harmer
5073957 its actually about going out into all the corners of life and seeing whats there
5073958 restaurant kitchens theyre all about tequila buggery and the lash

5073960 but he grew up in paraguay after the war i think his dad was probably some kind of mussolini dude
5073961 by now everyone must know firmino or have heard of him
5073962 in italy they changed the name to firmino so it sounded like a mozart opera i thought the book would sell in hundreds of copies perhaps i was very pleased with it but i thought well this is an odd book maybe itll be a good odd book but im not writing bestsellers i was thrilled but it made me worry a little
5073963 i was typing away i heard this voice i wrote the first few pages straight off and i didnt know it was a rat the next day suddenly i knew it was i wasnt too happy about it i thought well there goes the readership
5073964 i was a bit of a delinquent at that time or close to it
5073965 it was a time when you could just about be an intellectual criminal all that never felt like it was going to be big it felt like itd be a perpetual group of outsiders in a very puritanical and repressive country
5073966 it was all new england prep schools i didnt feel at ease
5073967 thinking as many people do that the meaning of life was in there somewhere its not i finally hit wittgenstein at which point the fly left the bottle
5073968 i got a job as a bicycle mechanic at a little bicycle co op just outside cambridge
5073969 but we eventually got out of the city down to south carolina
5073970 well the timberland that my father had owned turned out to be worth money when he died
5073971 not much but we could add on to it so my wife nora would work at you know terrible jobs and id work at terrible jobs and that kept us out of the trailers just barely but it did we built our house ourselves then the whole area became popular with tourists so we were able to sell it and move to madison which we would never have done except for pure luck
5073972 of course everyone asks me now why i waited so long to write and i give different answers i had always wanted to be a writer id written a lot of poetry which i didnt like then and dont like now i used to publish it every now and then but i found it very unsatisfactory
5073973 anyway when we moved up here we had to clear everything out all our books and papers and everything
5073974 because i know the solution it is to give up
5073975 now theres something in buddhism called i think the great death where people go to the master and they struggle and they memorise the texts and the sutras and so forth and they meditate and they meditate and they dont achieve it and then they give up
5073976 and you cant give up like that when youre young
5073977 you can only give up like that when you realise your life is approaching its end i did and it just came like a miracle
5073978 i wont play the hypocrite with you i never would have taken him in to tell the truth im afraid my wife and i lived through 37 when night after night every person in moscow feared his arrest you cant imagine what we went through listening for the fatal knock on the door or the sound of a car pulling up
5073979 expressed a preference for a government run like hell by filipinos to one run like heaven by americans
5073980 the government run by americans was hardly heavenly what with its colonial economy keeping the country a producer of cheap raw material for export and a market for highly priced imported goods and the filipino people in their place as hewers of wood and drawers of water the army and navy club with the sign dogs and filipinos not allowed and a cultural brainwashing that left the filipino with one dream to be an imitation american
5073981 if the american run government was not celestial the filipino run was sure hellish or at least purgatorial democracy being the only saving grace for allowing the filipinos to kick out their presidents and representatives and kick in the next hungry pack that turned out no better hungry mosquitos replacing over fed ones in the words of the late manila mayor arsenio h lacson
5073982 better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven
5073983 he who reigns within himself and rules passions desires and fears is more than a king
5073984 manuel luis quezon on his centenary appraisal chronology reader bibliography
5073985 i would prefer a government run like hell by filipinos to one run like heaven by americans because no matter how bad a filipino government might be improved
5073986 when we have our unfettered self rule i dare say we shall make mistakes but in that respect we shall not be original or monopolistic it is by our mistakes that we shall learn america has aided us to learn much of the art of government but we can master the art only by self practice in politics as in law or medicine or music or painting concrete achievement is not in the scholastic sphere but only in the sphere of scholasticism applied and anyway even in the united states and in england democracy is still on trial it is better for the philippines to be ill governed by the filipinos than well governed by the americans
5073987 no people exists that would not think itself happier even under its own bad government than it might really be under the good governance of an alien power
5073988 no race appreciates a condition of servitude or subjection to a conquering or an alien race
5073989 it is normal for a man to desire to be free even if actually he does not merit freedom but it is the desire itself that in time will bring the now impossible aspiration to realization
5073990 the people care more for good government than they do for self government
5073991 the fear is that the head of state may either exceed his powers or abuse them by improprieties to keep order is his main purpose
5073992 must protect the people from abuses and wrong doings and if anyone violates the law or commits abuses it is the duty of the government officials to go after such man regardless of who he is we must have but one norm of conduct in our dealings with the people the law must be the same for the powerful and for the weak for the rich and for the poor
5073993 the problem with you is that you take the game of politics too seriously you look too far behind you and too far ahead of you our people do not understand that they do not want it all they want is to have the present problem solved and solved with the least pain that is all

5074004 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5074005 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5074006 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5074007 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5074008 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5074009 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5074010 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world

5074015 after a long period of under investing in their information technology infrastructure and keeping most things like security and costs in house in a do it yourself culture indian companies have suddenly realised the need to leverage the web as a channel to expand their businesses rapidly
5074016 as a result the ability to remotely manage equipment is becoming a top priority
5074017 we leverage independent industry standards like saas 70 type ii a certified saas model and bs 7799 to drive a common framework based implementation of these policies and back the efforts through third party certification against these standards

5074021 if you look at my skills and if you look at pretty much everybody else it kind of looks like i have easier skills but its the combinations

5074039 ayer nos reunimos para aceptar a una persona neutral que no particip en el proceso electoral por izquierda unida o nueva izquierda se nos plante que fuera l zaro c rdenas batel hemos decidido aceptar la propuesta de ni y con un comit ejecutivo que se divida entre ocho integrantes por una parte y otros ocho por otra
5074040 de manera reiterada insistimos en que se instale la mesa de di logo y seguimos esperando
5074041 nos han dado muestras de un rotundo no a todas nuestras propuestas
5074042 es muestra de que la l nea dura de arce se est imponiendo en ese bloque es muestra de la cerraz n de ni nosotros proponemos que el consejo nacional se organice el 24 o 25 de agosto para transitar en un acuerdo pol tico
5074043 llegamos anoche con una propuesta que nos cost mucho les aceptamos que encabece el partido l zaro c rdenas y hoy nos responden con una actitud irresponsable hoy nos responden con esto con la decisi n de organizar su consejo en ciudad nezahualc yotl si piensan que vamos a poder transitar en medio de la ingobernabilidad est n muy equivocados no podemos convalidar una actitud tan irresponsable
5074044 sin embargo a pesar de las propuestas de iu no ha habido eco ayer se tuvieron reuniones de muy alto nivel para evitar la ruptura nos parece una propuesta clara y sensata la de que l zaro c rdenas
5074045 si quieren poner a toda costa al compa ero acosta con leonel cota monta o nueva izquierda argument que l pertenec a a una corriente y ahora quieren que acosta quede como imposici n es una persona con claros v nculos con ni

5074047 hemos hecho una propuesta para la presidencia nacional sustituta para relevar a guadalupe acosta naranjo en la persona de l zaro c rdenas batel y ahora ellos est n esperando que simplemente la confirmemos es una absoluta falsedad
5074048 la propia dolores padierna por cierto y tengo de testigos a todos los que all estuvieron reconoci que esa propuesta no hab a surgido de nueva izquierda reconoci que esa propuesta la hab a manejado en una pl tica con ellos manuel camacho sol s como una posibilidad de acuerdo con nosotros pero no vamos a entrar en componendas de ese tipo porque ser a en primer lugar aceptarles un veto contra guadalupe acosta y nos situar a en el terreno de la inconstitucionalidad
5074049 ellos iu piden 50 y 50 por ciento violando completamente la normatividad quieren 50 y 50 en el secretariado y luego adem s un presidente nacional que no sea de ninguno de los dos bloques por supuesto que nosotros no estamos en la l gica de la exclusi n

5074131 theres got to be at least 25 000 hidden in your house we can help you find it
5074132 calling it a second mortgage thats like hocking your house
5074133 but call it equity access and it sounds more innocent
5074134 its very difficult for one advertiser to come to you and change your perspective
5074135 but as it becomes socially acceptable for everyone to accumulate debt everyone does
5074136 youve put a lot of work into your home isnt it time for your home to return the favor
5074137 the second mortgage category then as probably now suffered from a pretty bad reputation
5074138 it generally tended to be a credit facility of last resort and it was done by people in dire straits that was not the audience we were after
5074139 you dont have to sell your home to get 10 000 30 000 or even more in cash you dont even have to walk out the door
5074140 now when the value of your home goes up you can take credit for it
5074141 banking started using consumer advertising techniques more like a department store than like a bank
5074142 we thought it would bring to the equity access category the same kind of reputation over time that had come to the second mortgage category
5074143 when you went to market research and asked people questions would you like to have 24 by 7 access to your money would you like to have access to home mortgages and credit cards even if the product didnt exist as such would you like a line of credit where you can just write a check anytime
5074144 theres no question then that that caused credit to enlarge
5074145 a lot of previous research has indicated the severity of mental health issues on college campuses has been increasing not decreasing and when you look at the lifetime prevalence rates those are alarming statistics

5074152 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5074153 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5074154 podemos ser talentosos y desayunar sin que eso sea incompatible
5074155 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5074156 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5074157 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5074158 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5074159 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5074160 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5074161 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5074162 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5074163 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5074164 everything is still shut where are we supposed to buy our bread from people are starving
5074165 there have been lots of looters the russian soldiers are in a way protecting us but some of the soldiers are good and some of the soldiers are bad

5074167 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5074168 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5074169 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5074170 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5074171 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5074172 i walked in there and i fell it was dark and i didnt know when i was going to stop
5074173 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5074174 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5074175 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5074176 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5074177 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5074178 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5074179 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5074180 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5074181 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5074182 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5074183 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5074184 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5074185 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5074186 hes definitely much more relaxed than you would think he was
5074187 he has been in this offense for what a week as fast as he has been getting everything its ridiculous
5074188 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5074189 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision

5074196 i was without e mail from july 18 to july 28
5074197 the day we launched mobileme we had a lot more traffic to our servers than we anticipated with the result that access to the web versions of the mobileme applications was temporarily unavailable
5074198 weve since added server capacity and tuned our software to scale better i e behave more gracefully when traffic spikes
5074199 we particularly regret to report the loss in the affected accounts of approximately 10 percent of the messages received between july 16 and july 18
5074200 if you dont think cloud computing through theres certainly plenty of things that can go wrong
5074201 the applications had to be ready by that date whether they were ready or not
5074202 thats probably the biggest part of apples problems with mobileme
5074203 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the online app store the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services and learn we will
5074204 there is a lot of promise for cloud computing but the technology is relatively new
5074205 it works reasonably well for storage but if you need it for communications real time 24 7 the reliability for these services is not there yet
5074206 theyre not known for their servers they have them but theyre hardly the largest theyre basically known for their devices the individual things like computers iphones and ipods stuff that exists in folks hands that never had to scale
5074207 one of the big security problems with online services in particular google is accidental data leakage
5074208 for example many users accidentally mark their google calendars another free service as public and everybody is now able to search them
5074209 you typically find sensitive information like conference calling dial in numbers or even bank account and pin numbers online
5074210 both from a reliability and a security perspective you trade away some reliability and some security some safety by using these free cloud based services rather than by doing it all on your own pc
5074211 for most consumers gmail yahoo mail and hotmail those have actually gotten pretty good from a security perspective its really not much of a risk the real issue is availability the service might go out for two or three hours you never know
5074212 the other thing is if something were to crash or say google or yahoo or any of these people have a fire and everything burns up well your photos are gone your e mail is gone there are no guarantees
5074213 for consumers any of these web based programs gmail or flickr where you might store your photos instead of on your own computer what youre getting is a really powerful thing pretty cheap right
5074214 and the old saying you get what you pay for even in this internet age still holds
5074215 detectives investigating the fatal stabbing of conor black in harpurhey have arrested a 16 year old boy on suspicion of murder
5074216 conor was killed on moston lane by a single stab wound to his upper left shoulder paramedics tried to treat conor for a puncture wound but he died on the way to hospital
5074217 anyone with any information about conors murder is asked to call police on 0161 856 3540 or crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111

5074221 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5074222 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5074223 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5074224 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5074225 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5074226 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5074227 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5074230 i think prince william was sort of seen as a jurisdiction as out of reach for most democratic candidates but then i won prince william in 2005 which frankly surprised me
5074231 our goal was to hold the margin of defeat down in prince william and then we won and webb won in 2006 and i think that what it shows is prince william is a part of virginia thats big thats growing and that politically is very much in play and if you pay attention and you invest the time and you can put good people in then you can win
5074232 i think governor kaine was right on when he described how senator obama would bring about change
5074233 unfortunately i dont think governor kaines own performance in office meets the standard that obama has set

5074272 seu lugar natural no centro de um sistema multilateral justo e eficaz

5074296 at this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information regarding these individuals so far as the two females arrested and charged last week they are still remanded in custody at her majestys prison again we are not in a position to disclose any details regarding their arrests and charges except to say they are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody

5074311 la verdad que acept porque creo que es un espacio que se abre para las comunidades y para el pueblo mapuche en el tema de la discriminaci n porque muchas veces nuestros derechos y el reconocimiento de nuestro pueblo es avasallado sobre todo en r o negro con la cuesti n de las tierras la miner a y todos los temas ambientales que est n dando vueltas creo que este es un espacio importante para trabajar y hacer valer el derecho ind gena
5074312 fue por mi militancia pol tica que es paralela al trabajo que yo hago sobre derecho ind gena nadie desconoce que desde lo ideol gico desde hace a os y con mi familia venimos militando en el justicialismo por eso estamos trabajando dentro del frente para la victoria y desde ese lugar julio busc en mi persona esa militancia pero esta es s lo una parte porque dentro del consejo consultivo hay un foro de trabajo dentro del cual tambi n se pueden hacer otras elecciones sobre todo lo que tenga que ver con el derecho ind gena se puede trabajar en paralelo por supuesto consustanciados en el tema si el pueblo mapuche quiere designar para el foro a otro hermano o hermana no habr ninguna dificultad
5074313 mi trabajo ha sido siempre aportar conocimiento no hay que ocultar que nosotros como pueblo dentro de una cosmovisi n y una filosof a tambi n tenemos nuestras diferencias eso es com n en todos los pueblos aparte est la sociedad blanca que a nosotros nos discrimina desde tiempos inmemoriales entonces el delegado me solicita que yo aporte en el marco de un trabajo ad honorem el consejo consultivo est integrado por gente que trabaja sobre medioambiente la discriminaci n en salud la comunidad jud a y otros sectores son aproximadamente 16 o 17 personas que van a conformar el consejo consultivo
5074314 creo que hay un espacio que se ha abierto porque la cuesti n ind gena dentro del inadi se trabaj en distintos foros que se hicieron en las diversas regiones y a nivel nacional en ellos todos los pueblos originarios de la argentina le propusieron al estado una nueva pol tica dentro de la gesti n y la funci n p blica se trabaj y se fue abriendo porque de hecho en la secretar a de medioambiente de la naci n hay un hermano que est en la direcci n de pueblos originarios son espacios que se han ido abriendo y que probablemente nosotros ni siquiera conocemos porque sabemos como funcionamos a veces con nuestros ego smos y con espacios que por ah no abrimos a veces somos mucho m s cerrados que la gente de otras culturas
5074315 desde ese lugar creo que es importante la cuesti n discriminatoria no solamente hacia el pueblo mapuche tambi n hay que mirar formosa o chaco
5074316 creo que hay un espacio que se puede abrir que hay un abanico de trabajo que se puede hacer haci ndole ver al estado que existimos que ac hay una cultura una filosof a de vida y una organizaci n social
5074317 donde no podemos actuar con mezquindad todos as est la circunstancia as est nuestra realidad y no podemos ser mezquinos ya los ciudadanos est n pidiendo que se rindan cuentas y me parece que ah no debe haber mezquindad
5074318 porque de nada sirve que nos inviten y nos informen sin que podamos tomar decisiones
5074319 la tienda est ardiendo totalmente pero tenemos un 40 de sofocaci n del incendio creemos que estar totalmente apagado en tres o cuatro horas afortunadamente no tenemos registrado ning n herido

5074346 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5074347 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5074348 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5074349 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5074350 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5074351 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5074352 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offence as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5074353 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5074354 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5074355 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5074356 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5074357 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5074358 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person

5074362 nos hemos empezado a quitar el estigma de que el cine mexicano era malo esto tiene que ver con nuevas realidades mejores producciones y dedicaci n de quienes emprenden la aventura de hacer cine
5074363 hemos superado la etapa de hablar s lo de la violencia en las calles y de la pobreza los cineastas han buscado otros temas de inter s
5074364 el cine es como una especie de terapia pero no huyo de mis demonios sino que yo trabajo con ellos con mis sentimientos mis pensamientos y con cosas cercanas

5074374 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website

5074376 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5074377 young adult women who undergo induced abortion may be at increased risk for subsequent depression
5074378 more likely to score above the cut off point for depression
5074379 for mental disorders and for risk factors that may be associated with its subsequent development
5074380 consent cannot be informed without the provision of adequate and appropriate information regarding the possible risks and benefits to physical and mental health
5074381 it would be very difficult to pull this information together
5074382 one of her grad students replied on her behalf with the additional summary statistics we had requested within 48 hours
5074383 so it clearly wasnt at all difficult for her team to access the data plus with modern electronic data bases and multiple backup procedures in place at universities like hers it is nearly impossible to lose such data
5074384 i know of a number of experts in the field who have requested the data even within the last six months but she simply doesnt respond to their calls emails or letters
5074385 how can we trust the objectivity of a report prepared by a task force composed exclusively of pro choice psychologists especially when the chair and lead author has a history of withholding data and findings which may undermine her ideological preferences
5074386 it is undeniable that significant numbers of women are injured by abortion and should not be ignored by the medical profession and that significant numbers of women suffer serious physical mental or psychological trauma as a result of abortion
5074387 given that the supreme court the eighth circuit the british royal academy of psychiatrists 100 american scientists medical and mental health professionals and 3000 post abortive women and men agree that abortion can potentially severely hurt women we want that truth to be recognized by the american psychological association

5074401 we came here with the purpose of getting a result and im delighted to come away with a point
5074402 i said to the team before the game we have pace and power in our side and i think weve got more than man united
5074403 its not often you get a result here but we did because every one of our players put in a fantastic performance
5074404 in the end we might have even won it we created lots of chances and played as a team both going forward and defending
5074405 i thought it was a good game and both teams were very committed
5074406 we didnt make one change today and our fitness levels because of the hard work weve done over the summer really showed towards the end
5074407 we go into bolton now full of confidence and hopefully well follow up todays performance

5074412 i thought it was two teams that played pretty intense i thought we had an outstanding first half i kind of almost thought we were the home team for awhile unfortunately we did not score more than one goal but we came out in the second half and were able to do pretty well in the first five 10 minutes of the second half and when columbus scored the first goal they quickly scored again

5074419 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5074420 assured that georgians will not continue to use military force
5074421 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5074422 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5074423 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5074424 i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not
5074425 however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it

5074432 its cool theres a breeze its perfect conditions for a 10000m race
5074433 im very excited ive talked to my mum every day since ive been here banana dumpling has produced the top three
5074434 that was absolutely unreal ive lived my childhood dream im shocked and really really happy i took my dads advice he told me to run run run its been a fantastic year for me and now i just want to bring it home in 2012
5074435 im not sure that its fair to count 1908 our three tug of war medals are undoubtedly impressive however in rackets we were the only country that actually competed making us strong favourites to take the medal
5074436 that heat was stacked you name anybody whod be in the shout for a medal and they were there that was my final and now im there this is what its all about great britain and an olympic final
5074437 we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance our olympians talent and dedication represent the very best of britain and we look forward to another great week of british sporting success
5074438 im a little confused the bbc tv coverage keeps telling me that 15 gold medals is our all time best at any olympics but the ioc website tells me that we won 56 golds at the 1908 games in london and 15 in the 1920 games in antwerp am i going mad
5074439 this is the greatest weekend in british olympic history we havent delivered at this level of consistency across some of the sports which i would call the formula one sports for many many generations
5074440 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things especially here winning here for me is unbelievable
5074441 im really disappointed because i thought i could do it again im going to take a day to recover and then come back for the relay
5074442 ben why does lee mcconnell getting knocked out of the 400m warrant an uppy union jack
5074443 im feeling really great im happy to win the heat and happy to go under 50
5074444 this was a very smart run on her part it wasnt a great start she didnt panic but she knows shes a strong athlete great job
5074445 i cant believe it im speechless my trainings been going awesome i finished my routine and i just wanted to collapse ive never felt like this before
5074446 i have worked out why you continue to use the horrendous term team gb its politically incorrect to use the word great as its seen as offensive to many minority ethnic groups at least according to the trendy left wing socialists who run the bbc
5074447 kazakhstans first gold medal of the games goes to 20 year old ilya ilin in the mens 94kg category lifting a total of 406kg kazakhstans athletes were on a promise of 250 000 for a gold medal happy happy ilya
5074448 im really pleased to be here i know its only round one but im thankful im on the team ive been in no mans land for a few weeks
5074449 how can you not show rafa nadal getting his gold medal disgusting
5074450 that was amazing there was no other option for me today but to get into that final and ive done it i knew i had it in me to get to the final and it has been my little secret target for the season and im absolutely chuffed that i did it
5074451 ive definitely got more to come because that race was quite messy and i hit two of the hurdles so i know i can do better in the semi final
5074452 this is just brilliant i keep refreshing the medal table first time in 22 years of watching the summer games that ive seen us above germany germany these guys used to kill us what a team performance
5074453 to james jones see below perhaps the working classes should start trying a bit harder at boxing running and whatever else they are good at
5074454 james jones see below is such a damp squib every country makes the most of its advantages the kenyan and ethiopian runners live at altitude but that doesnt make their distance medals worth any less the slovakians won all the canoe white water golds it is their national sport same with many disciplines every medal is worth its weight in gold
5074455 why are we seeing so many upside down union flags look in the velodrome crowd and even rebecca adlingtons sister in an interview on the bbc doe nt anyone know how to fly our flag
5074456 cant help noticing the success to date has come from the posh sports track cycling is very much a minority sport and only the countries that can afford to pump in millions will feature in the future but hey we will all be sucked up into the euphoria and watch the golden boys and girls make a small fortune just like students they should now be able to pay back their grants
5074457 actually i have found anons comments throughout the olympics to be inappropriate
5074458 we have been mentally rehearsing for this for the last two days we knew if we went out there and did it well wed have a chance of winning
5074459 there are more nip and tuck affairs here than at the porn oscars that mens eight race was another cracker you cant really begrudge the canadians can you nice bunch so thats 2 2 2 for us here which makes shunyi a british lake hurrah
5074460 that was another heartstopper well done canada i told you earlier they were on the warpath no one was to deny them today sorry chaps see you in london
5074461 its sad that we have people like anon see below posting messages on here the quad girls have every right to look disappointed the gold was the pinnacle for them too many times we have seen brits settle for second best but its refreshing to see such passion
5074462 i knew it was in me a week ago it wasnt gold medals dont come easy when i was crossing the line i had to check it was me
5074463 well done sir steve puts down his microphone and hugs and talks in a huddle with the quad girls much better than another unnecessary interview well done sir steve and well done the quad girls
5074464 we all believed we could do it we just let it slip away at the end we gave 100 but we just didnt get it right
5074465 im speechless it felt like this medal race would never come its three years of hard work and im a very happy man strong winds and rain today but its what i was hoping for
5074466 the british girls were looking good relaxed and in control but china were fantastic one silver medal is a great achievement but if you keep getting them it must be devastating
5074467 this place the rowing lake has gone utterly bongo hard lines for kit grainger and co it looked nailed on at 1500m but that was a superb finish by the chinese hats off and all that
5074468 its great to be british brilliant weekend for the watery and wheelie sports excellent results in the pool the rowing the cycling and the sailing but we do need to sort out our track and field
5074469 that was amazing i want to see that flag go up thats all ive ever wanted to see since ive started rowing its the most amazing thing ive ever done
5074470 that puts us above the aussies kylie minogue dame edna everage john howard crocodile dundee ricky ponting can you hear me ricky ponting your boys are taking one hell of a beating
5074471 can we just decide as a nation to win the most medals at london in 2012 being the best at the olympics would be a lot more fun than being the best at moaning about the weather
5074472 i only came in 10 minutes ago but many people were watching the marathon in my restaurant in mexico did every tv station show paula running off to take a pee here they replayed it five times in slow motion it really did nothing for the appetites of my diners
5074473 nelson would not have been impressed with the girls in the yngling they flew the union flag upside down thats not victory its help well done ladies
5074474 excellent to see a brit in the ladies tennis final even if it is the umpire
5074475 team gb is so totally dominant in the cycling that surely its time to stop using the french word
5074476 take the golds won by phelps away and usa have won the same number of golds as gb including the one guaranteed gold in cycling today in a few hours we will have 3 more one in sailing and 2 in rowing that is ignoring cycling where we dont lose
5074477 its been brilliant and just highlights what our campaign is all about pure perfection with 2012 being on the doorstep is definitely on the agenda i hope so
5074478 gold has been the dream but it has not sunk in yet its pretty awesome weve known since day one you can expect anything out here it makes it tough but thats the strength we have as a team
5074479 i actually said we had nine chances of gold and would probably get five but the rest of the world has stepped back and weve stepped up
5074480 morning pranav just been woken up by the sound of my cat being sick twice no chance of sleep after that so time for some stormy yngling
5074481 i cant put my finger on one race they have all been meaningful and they are all races ill remember for the rest of my life it was great to finish with a relay and a world record
5074482 i wanted to do something no one else had done in sport this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing the sport of swimming the greatest thing is proving nothing is impossible so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
5074483 man we just rule in the cycling if only we were this dominant at other events
5074484 i dont even know what to feel right now theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5074485 we have been told we can ask him one question and i am going to get him to sign up for london 2012 he may reduce his programme in the future and do more sprints like the 100m freestyle there were questions in the press conference yesterday about how much the wins this week might be worth and everyone booed he said he didnt care about the money he wanted to come here and do something special but it will be worth a lot to him i dont think hes going to have to worry about his mortgage in america
5074486 never in doubt the greatest olympian ever or just the greatest ever let the debate commence
5074487 incredible womens 4x100m medley relay the aussies pipped the yanks for first in a new world record and the chinese pipped us for fourth the rest of the british team becky a in the back row were giving it loads for the relay girls its you know who looking for you know what next history beckons
5074488 oussama mellouli denies grant hackett a third straight 1500m gold climbs out of the pool before the last guy has finished walks around the pool like a man swimming in his lunch hour with a 2pm meeting to get back to nearly slips rounding the first corner hugs his coach and then calmly heads towards the changing room as though the last 15 minutes have been the most normal of his life good lad
5074489 thirty six hours to recover is tough i tried everything i could but the second half i was really struggling i was glad to be in it and wanted to go quicker but i have to recover now because i have to do a 10km its going to be a different challenge and im looking forward to it
5074490 im really pleased i really wanted a medal but im happy with sixth as it equals the best ever for a british woman im glad i didnt settle for seventh in the end i thought we would catch dita but she just held on there is no way i could have gone with that pace
5074491 i was trying to achieve the impossible because the amount of running i had done wasnt enough you cant take short cuts in the marathon its not the end we still keep fingers crossed for 2012 maybe the olympics wont happen for me but how hold is constantina maybe my body will hold out i know in london i will have all that support

5074496 with team gb winning gold and silver in two cycling events it made me wonder he we had ever won bronze silver and gold in the same event
5074497 morning watched every minute of live coverage yesterday was asleep by 5pm and am now up to watch paula and liz battle it out looking forward to another awesome effort by all of team gb
5074498 im totally gripped by these games and im determined to stay up to watch paula and then the rest of the events tonight any tips on how to stop myself nodding off
5074499 go paula running with one leg is the bravest thing ive seen since watching a guy face down an army of millwall fans armed only with lemon chicken
5074500 things are warming up nicely for the marathon finish thousands of chinese fans are bashing their inflatable sticks to a bit of tchaikovsky theres a bizarre procession of bikes bearing flags going one way and caped child speed skaters going the other bonkers
5074501 whats this a few spots of rain its getting better and better for our paula
5074502 paula radcliffe looked to be running very well as she got away at the gun she couldnt have hoped for more with the weather cool and overcast now all we need is a bit of drizzle

5074504 eu gostaria que o padrinho fosse o rapha pois o primo que eu mais gosto
5074505 when our needs lead us to grab desperately for a place when our unhealed wounds determine the atmosphere around us we become anxious but then we let our hurt remind us of our need for healing as we dance and walk forward grace provides the ground on which our steps fall
5074506 to be grateful does not mean repressing our remembered hurts but as we come to god with our hurts honestly not superficially something life changing can begin slowly to happen
5074507 of course it is easy for me to push the bad memories under the rug of my consciousness and think only about the good things that please me it seems to be the way to fulfillment by doing so however i keep myself from discovering the joy beneath the sorrow the meaning to be coaxed out of even painful memories
5074508 required the company to retain all the pension liabilities for current and former employees of the retail business this is unacceptable to the board
5074509 if they woolworths were going to sell stores wed buy some of their stores
5074510 this year we closed nine opened 10 weve only gained one we need to ramp up our store opening programme
5074511 we had a nice little rain with wind up to 20 knots

5074518 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5074519 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5074520 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5074521 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5074522 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5074523 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5074524 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5074525 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5074526 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5074527 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5074528 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5074529 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5074530 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5074531 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5074532 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5074533 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5074534 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5074535 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5074536 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5074537 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5074538 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5074539 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5074540 shes always cooking with shrimp and i just end up saying im not hungry when im freaking starving but i dont want to make her feel bad so im not going to say anything it would just create a problem and shed feel bad
5074541 oh my god talia was talking such trash about you last night but i totally stood up for you
5074542 i totally shouldnt have said anything pretend i didnt say anything
5074543 i had like 3 girls all calling me up to go out but i was still so hungover from the night before that i had to bail
5074544 whatever dude we know you ordered chinese and watched project runway
5074545 so viel hast du ja in den letzten tagen gar nicht gegessen
5074546 unter 100 und wollte wieder auf 90 kg runter hat nat rlich dank pizzen gyros mcdonalds und all ihrer freunde nicht geklappt
5074547 unter 100 zu kommen daf r habe ich etwas mehr als eine woche zeit m sste klappen weil ich in den letzten tagen ja erst nach oben geschossen bin theoretisch wird es mit viel disziplin also auch wieder schnell nach unten gehen k nnen
5074548 it is very sad this accident must have been a pure mishap reg was so experienced he would not have knowingly put his life in danger the weather probably overtook them
5074549 he had been climbing for a long time he had skill and experience by the bucketload he was a cut above the norm
5074550 although he had climbed everywhere and gone up some very difficult peaks he was very modest about his achievements he never bragged about what he had done he was an impeccable gentleman and always willing to share his expertise
5074551 i suppose they lost their bearings as weather conditions deteriorated sharply the weather has been appalling during the past 72 hours more like midwinter than midsummer it looks as if both men were trapped by the bad weather which had been forecast but they were not prepared for it they spent the night in freezing conditions
5074552 he seemed expert enough and in good physical shape perhaps in better shape than his companion
5074553 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5074554 lets not do this as a society but lets fully understand people before we criticize
5074555 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5074556 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5074557 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5074558 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5074559 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5074560 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5074561 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5074562 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5074563 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5074564 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5074565 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5074566 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5074567 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5074568 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5074569 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5074570 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5074571 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5074572 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5074573 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5074641 defendant found himself stuck in rush hour traffic near a car that was occupied by two women one white and one black the car had a rainbow decal on the rear which caused defendant to assume that the women were lesbians the womens car pulled in front of defendants pickup truck as the lanes narrowed from two to one defendant became angry and began tailgating the women and using some sound amplification system shouted various obscene and racist epithets at the women accompanied by extremely rude gestures defendants conduct drew the attention of other drivers and lasted for about five minutes as the cars inched through stop and go traffic eventually one of the women got out of the car to confront defendant defendant did not leave his pickup but he and the woman engaged in a heated verbal exchange defendant did not verbally threaten the woman with violence and no actual violence took place but the woman later testified that she believed that defendant was trying to incite her to violence she ultimately returned to her car when her companion intervened and told her that a person in the bed of the pickup was swinging a skateboard in a menacing way the two women then drove away and called the police
5074642 publicly insulting such other person by abusive words or gestures in a manner intended and likely to provoke a violent response
5074643 no law shall be passed restraining the free expression of opinion or restricting the right to speak write or print freely on any subject whatever but every person shall be responsible for the abuse of this right
5074644 the statute proscribes a certain species of harassment or annoyance period
5074645 taunts intended and likely to produce a violent response are not limited to playgrounds and gang disputes
5074646 they extend to political social and economic confrontations that range from union picket lines to the protagonists on a host of divisive issues and thus include a wide range of protected speech moreover courts have long recognized that even speech that is intended and likely to produce violence may not be criminalized unless the violence is imminent it follows we believe that a harassment statute that lacks that limitation sweeps too much protected speech within its reach to survive a facial challenge
5074647 harassment and annoyance are among common reactions to seeing or hearing gestures or words that one finds unpleasant
5074648 words or gestures that cause only that kind of reaction however cannot be prohibited in a free society even if the words or gestures occur publicly and are insulting abusive or both stated another way ors 166 065 1 a b constitutionally may protect a hearer or viewer from exposure to a reasonable fear of immediate harm due to certain types of expression but it cannot criminally punish all harassing or annoying expression
5074649 the state may not suppress all speech that offends with the club of the criminal law
5074650 we recognize that our decision today prevents using the criminal law to alleviate some kinds of distressing circumstances but that is a consequence of oregons explicit protection of freedom of expression in article i section 8 we note however that our ruling is confined to the states attempt to use the criminal law in retaliation against defendants expression we state no opinion as to whether some civil remedy or even some other part of the criminal law might be applied to the facts of this or other similar cases

5074667 nat rlich sind wir von diesem ergebnis ma los entt uscht denn unsere trainingspace war gut
5074668 heute morgen lief alles wunderbar und wir dachten dass wir vorne mit dabei sein w rden bis zum crash liefen die dinge auch nach plan ich habe einfach immer wieder die gleichen rundenzeiten abgespult und war mit meinem speed sehr zufrieden
5074669 der unfall kam aus dem nichts das war eine leichte kurve ich verlor die front und alles passierte ganz schnell und sehr pl tzlich da konnte ich leider nichts mehr machen das kann man nur schwer erkl ren wir m ssen uns erst die daten anschauen aber auf so einem niveau kann so etwas schon einmal vorkommen das war ein fehler
5074670 wir h tten dieses rennen gewinnen m ssen das wussten wir
5074671 so wird die meisterschaft f r uns zu einer ziemlich schwierigen angelegenheit
5074672 ich werfe nicht das handtuch auch bei ducati will niemand kuschen wir werden bis zum ende k mpfen im rennsport kann alles passieren aber eine 50 punkte l cke zu so einem starken und konstanten rivalen zu schlie en
5074673 sein erster schnitzer seit er f r uns rennen f hrt und der tut gleich richtig weh

5074675 heute haben wir gezeigt dass das motorrad nicht nur mit casey konkurrenzf hig sein kann

5074677 je weniger sprit im tank war und je w rmer die reifen wurden desto besser wurde der grip ich konnte meine rundenzeiten stetig verbessern und habe zur gruppe vor mir aufgeschlossen habe dann berholt sehr schade dass ich in den ersten runden mehr als zehn sekunden verloren habe denn das h tte heute gut und gerne ein hervorragendes ergebnis werden k nnen

5074702 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5074703 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge

5074713 its its its a challenge just for the challenge of it
5074714 it would be the same thing to ask why do we teach in the city sometimes i do ask myself that im tired of this i would rather be here or there
5074715 but you just do it you dont want to give up you want to keep fighting
5074716 we are danko jones there are no needles in our venes and we have the balls to play our show whenever were asked to

5074731 im talking about the way girls are really touchy feely and sisterly
5074732 i was scared of boys my first kiss was with a boy and he almost swallowed me alive i wish i had kissed that girl i had the girl crush on when i was growing up i would have been much more prepared for my dating life
5074733 i can now advise that an interdepartmental committee comprised of officials from both the office of public works and my department has been established with a view to overseeing a successful resolution to this issue
5074734 this committee is considering all options including an initial need to undertake remedial repairs to the structure of the building involving mainly roof and window repairs and to enhance its external appearance these works would be appropriate regardless of the future longer term plans for the house
5074735 in the meantime this would facilitate a more considered review of the possible appropriate new uses for the building itself in this regard some preliminary discussions are taking place with f ilte ireland in regard to its tourism capital investment programme to explore funding possibilities
5074736 it is sad and disappointing that this beautiful house and gardens has been allowed to decay but i know minister gormleys heart is in the right place and i hope that he will be able to put things to right

5074741 we had to do a few things to put pressure on the city and the state but our goal was to remain here in pittsburgh all the way those trips to kansas city and vegas and other cities was just to go and have a nice dinner and come back

5074747 the baiting of the bear and cockfights are no meet not good recreations
5074748 i have beaten all of them the fight really starts now but its not about who can run fastest in any final its about the one who is mentally strongest the one who is hungriest for victory
5074749 remember i learn more each time i compete in a major meeting
5074750 i dont want to make the same mistake that i made in helsinki there i ran a 48 16 in the semi final it cost me because i had nothing left in the final my legs were gone
5074751 wont it be incredible if we can finish first second and third
5074752 i want the others to know i am back and i am hungry for victory
5074753 it was interesting and rather disturbing to see that the south african swim captain was apparently celebrating the fact that i did not win a medal in the event
5074754 an athlete from another country who sat next to gerhard came to me afterwards and told me how shocked he was to see gerhard openly celebrate the result with a big smile on his face
5074755 what can i say to that but captain my captain
5074756 could not be disturbed even through the actions of the press and management
5074757 there are so many stories to tell about what was happening behind the scenes even though things were against us we tried to go out every day and give our best performances sometimes i wonder about the way the public and media are so quick to criticise
5074758 a swimmer needs to be allowed to prepare with the least possible problems and you need to handle the stress and get yourself into the zone
5074759 suzaan was asked to swim in a bodysuit because the sponsor had nothing else available it isnt an easy process to put on one of these swimsuits and can take up to 10 minutes to fit
5074760 her first suit ripped and so did the second seconds ticked past and she needed to get ready a third swimsuit was found but also tore when it was put on she had no other choice but to swim in her normal practice suit

5074777 batman arkham asylum offers players the chance to battle gothams worst villains with batmans physical and psychological strength in a graphically distinct and story driven game
5074778 we look forward to working with eidos on expanding dc comics world renowned character batman in the game space with a noticeably different feature set in an incredibly dark interactive environment
5074779 the inspiration for c o r e comes from the teams love of the classic early video games like doom quake and half life these incredible games have that great combination of skilful and addictive gameplay which we have now re created for the nintendo ds
5074780 its a horrendous circumstance and as much as we do its unlikely that anyone would ever have the ability to stop an incident like this from beginning
5074781 we will launch big tv in mumbai on august 19
5074782 csm idsm adsm performance problems or memory errors increase java memory
5074783 no matter how many codes and court cases you have to support your position some judges are not willing to expose the corrupt public sector that we have today
5074784 can i use low calorie sweeteners low calorie sweeteners are safe for everyone except people with phenylketonuria who should not use aspartame calorie free sweeteners like aspartame saccharin sucralose and acesulfame k wont increase your blood glucose level
5074785 we wish to report another accidental discovery of an organic compound with a profound sucrose table sugar like taste preliminary tasting showed this compound to have a potency of 100 200 times sucrose depending on concentration and on what other flavors are present and to be devoid of unpleasant aftertaste
5074786 superficially it seemed like if there would ever be a safe kind of product that would be it the idea that two naturally occurring amino acids could harm someone in relatively small amounts seemed unlikely
5074787 although it was stated that studies were also performed with diketopiperazine dkp an impurity which results from acid hydrolysis of aspartame no data are provided on this product
5074788 it is not feasible to extrapolate results of such single dose testing to the likely condition of use of aspartame as an artificial sweetener
5074789 chemistry no information is provided other than formulae for aspartame and its diketo piperazine
5074790 pharmacology reference is made to 2 year rat studies but no data are provided on acute or chronic toxicity
5074791 clinical no protocols nor curriculum vitae information are provided for the 10 completed clinical studies
5074792 no pharmacokinetic data are provided on absorption excretion metabolism half life nor bioavailability of capsule vs food additive administration
5074793 1 the administration of aspartame as reported in these studies at high dosage levels for prolonged periods constitutes clinical investigational use of a new drug substance
5074794 2 the information submitted for our review is inadequate to permit a scientific evaluation of clinical safety
5074795 commercial quantities of the sweetener will be supplied from the enlarged facility of ajinomoto
5074796 the information submitted for our review was limited to narrative clinical summaries and tabulated mean values of laboratory studies no protocols manufacturing controls information or preclinical data were provided such deficiencies in each area of required information precluded a scientific evaluation of the clinical safety of this product
5074797 before the task force had completed its investigation in 1976 searle had submitted the vast majority of the more than 100 tests it ultimately gave the fda in an effort to get aspartame approved these included all tests ever described as pivotal by the fda about half the pivotal tests were done at searle about one third were done at hazleton laboratories pivotal tests include long term two year tests such as those done to determine whether aspartame might cause cancer former fda commissioner alexander schmidt said in a recent interview that if a pivotal test is found to be unreliable it must be repeated some studies are more important than others and they have to be done impeccably schmidt said
5074798 payments to employees of certain foreign governments to obtain sales of their products
5074799 practices that were noted in connection with any given such study were quite likely to have been noted also for other studies that were audited and this was a situation which was in no way unexpected after all the set of all such studies executed by that firm from about 1968 to the were conducted in essentially the same facilities by virtually the same technicians professional workers and supervisors and the nature of such studies does not differ much whether a food additive or a drug product is being tested for safety in laboratory animals it is in this sense therefore that the overall conclusion summarized at the beginning of the searle task force report have relevance to all the studies audited in 1975 whether they had references to aspartame or to any of the six drug products of searles and by extension to the totality of experimental studies carried out by that firm around that time 1968 to 1975
5074800 at the heart of fdas regulatory process is its ability to rely upon the integrity of the basic safety data submitted by sponsors of regulated products our investigation clearly demonstrates that in the case of the gd searle company we have no basis for such reliance now
5074801 we have noted that searle has not submitted all the facts of experiments to fda retaining unto itself the unpermitted option of filtering interpreting and not submitting information which we would consider material to the safety evaluation of the product finally we have found instances of irrelevant or unproductive animal research where experiments have been poorly conceived carelessly executed or inaccurately analyzed or reported
5074802 some of our findings suggest an attitude of disregard for fdas mission of protection of the public health by selectively reporting the results of studies in a manner which allay the concerns of questions of an fda reviewer
5074803 unreliability in searles animal research does not imply however that its animal studies have provided no useful information on the safety of its products poorly controlled experiments containing random errors blur the differences between treated and control animals and increase the difficulty of discriminating between the two populations to detect a product induced effect a positive finding of toxicity in the test animals in a poorly controlled study provides a reasonable lower bound on the true toxicity of the substance the agency must be free to conclude that the results from such a study while admittedly imprecise as to incidence or severity of the untoward effect cannot be overlooked in arriving at a decision concerning the toxic potential of the product
5074804 excising masses tumors from live animals in some cases without histologic examination of the masses in others without reporting them to the fda
5074805 these masses were in the head and neck areas and prevented the animals from feeding
5074806 failure to report to the fda all internal tumors present in the experimental rats e g polyps in the uterus ovary neoplasms as well as other lesions
5074807 stored animal tissues in formaldehyde for so long that they deteriorated
5074808 instead of performing autopsies on rhesus monkeys that suffered seizures after being fed aspartame the company had financed a new monkey seizure study with a different methodology that showed no problems
5074809 reporting animals as unavailable for necropsy when in fact records indicate that the animals were available but searle choose not to purchase them
5074810 these include approximately 20 instances of animals reported as dead and then reported as having vital signs normal again at subsequent observation periods
5074811 selecting statistical procedures which used a total number of animals as the denominator when only a portion of the animals were examined thus reducing the significance of adverse effects
5074812 significant deviations from the protocols of several studies were noted which may have compromised the value of these studies in at least one study the aspartame 52 weeks monkey study the protocol was written after the study had been initiated
5074813 it is significant to note that the searle employee responsible for reviewing most of the reproduction studies had only one year of prior experience working on population dynamics of cotton tail rabbits while employed by illinois wildlife service in order to prepare him for this title of senior research assistant in teratology fetal damage searle bought him books to read on the subject and also sent him to a meeting of the teratology society this qualified him to submit 18 of the initial tests to the fda in addition to training an assistant and 2 technicians he certainly must have kept them busy because searle claimed that 329 teratology examinations were conducted in just 2 days he estimated that he himself examined about 30 fetuses a day but officials for the center for food and applied nutrition could never determine how that was possible
5074814 in each study investigated poor practices inaccuracies and discrepancies were noted in the antemortem phases which could compromise the study
5074815 presenting information to fda in a manner likely to obscure problems such as editing the report of a consulting pathologist reporting one pathology report while failing to submit or make reference to another usually more adverse pathology report on the same slide
5074816 no records were found to indicate that any treatment mixtures used in the studies were ever tested or assayed for pesticide content running inventory records for either treatment mixtures or the test compounds used in treatment mixtures are not maintained
5074817 contrary to protocol slides were not prepared of this unusual lesions from the aspartame dkp study tissue for microscopic examination
5074818 in the aspartame 46 weeks hamster study blood samples reported in the submission to fda as 26 week values for certain specified animals were found by our investigators as being in fact values for different animals which were bled at the 38th week many of the animals for which these values were reported to the fda were dead at the 38th week
5074819 it is apparent from the report that the appendix portion contains all the individual animal values of clinical lab data available from the raw data file a selected portion of these values appears to have been used in computing group means which were reported to the fda it is not clear what criteria may have been used for selecting a portion of the data or for deleting the others in computing the means reported to the fda
5074820 searle technical personnel failed to adhere to protocols make accurate observations sign and date records and accurately administer the product under test and proper lab procedures
5074821 clerical or arithmetic errors which resulted in reports of fewer tumors
5074822 they g d searle lied and they didnt submit the real nature of their observations because had they done that it is more than likely that a great number of these studies would have been rejected simply for adequacy what searle did they took great pains to camouflage these shortcomings of the study as i say filter and just present to the fda what they wished the fda to know and they did other terrible things for instance animals would develop tumors while they were under study well they would remove these tumors from the animals
5074823 even following the track you did it seems to me you have only confounded the issue by a series of studies most of which have severe design deficiencies or obvious lack of expertise in animal management because of these twin factors all the careful and detailed examination of fetuses all the writing summarization and resummarization is of little avail because of the shaky foundation
5074824 searles studies were incredibly sloppy science what we discovered was reprehensible
5074825 the pathologists were specifically told that they were not to make a judgment about aspartames safety or to look at the designs of the tests
5074826 meanwhile an interview with endicott indicates that adrian gross was right the pathologists out a comprehensive review
5074827 he said the main witnesses searle executives and top fda officials uninvolved in the investigation gave the wrong answers to the wrong questions
5074828 you should have seen things when this study was run there were five studies being run at one time things were a mess
5074829 the question you have got to ask yourself is because of the importance of this study why wasnt greater care taken the study is highly questionable because of our findings why didnt searle with their scientists closely evaluate this knowing fully well that the whole society from the youngest to the elderly from the sick to the unsick will have access to this product
5074830 the task force could find no evidence that this was a deliberate attempt to influence the study
5074831 it could not be determined if the results would have been altered
5074832 jacqueline verrett the senior scientist on the review team said members were barred from stating opinions about the research quality
5074833 this authentication was hence intended to verify that the submitted data had not been altered that it reflected the actual outcome of the study and that it did not change substantially particularly in a statistical sense the various parameters from which the conclusion of safety had been derived
5074834 our analysis of the data in this manner revealed that in these three studies there were really no substantial changes that resulted although in numerous instances a definitive answer could not be arrived at because of the basic inadequacies and improper procedures used in the execution of these studies
5074835 i would like to emphasize the point that we were specifically instructed not to be concerned with or to comment upon the overall validity of the study
5074836 it would appear that the safety of aspartame and its breakdown products has still not been satisfactorily determined since many of the flaws cited in these three studies were also present in all of the other studies submitted by searle
5074837 well they told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to comment on the validity of it
5074838 i do not feel that was done based on what i have read in the gao report that i have looked at and so forth
5074839 we were looking at a lot of little details and easy parameters in this study when the foundation of the study the diet and all of these other things were worthless we were talking about the jockey when we should have been talking about the horse that he had weak legs it is built on a foundation of sand
5074840 the public board of inquiry on aspartame should provide a vehicle for definitive resolution at least for those studies about which you are most concerned
5074841 no discrepancies in any of the sponsors reports that were of sufficient magnitude or nature that would compromise that data originally submitted
5074842 may well be interpreted as nothing short of a whitewash
5074843 ruling on objections and notice of hearing before a public board of inquiry aspartame
5074844 it was a shocking story we were told about searles animal testing but there was no way we could go after it we had absolutely no way of knowing who was right we had to take the fdas word
5074845 based his decision on a consideration of aspartic acid alone without regard to the real issue i e is it safe to add aspartic acid to the large amounts of glutamic acid msg that are already adulterating the food supply
5074846 he would call in all his markers and that no matter what he would see to it that aspartame would be approved that year
5074847 douglas park said that panel lawyer joseph levitt hurried the panel to decide the issue
5074848 park said levitt met frequently with hayes and was obviously getting the pressure to get a resolution and a decision made
5074849 with three of five scientists on the commissioners team opposing approval it was decided to bring in a toxicologist for his opinion on isolated issues barry n
5074850 levitt who normally would have been expected to draft an options paper spelling out scientific evidence on key issues took an unusual tack he circulated an approval recommendation and only backed off when dubey park and condon objected team members said levitt said he was not directed to draft the approval memo but did so as a tactical step to break the teams weeks long impasse by forcing each scientist to state his views it worked didnt it said levitt who later was promoted to a post as an executive assistant to the fda commissioner
5074851 aspartame safety act of 1985 which required quantity labeling of aspartame on food items and mandated that there be a moratorium on new uses of aspartame until independent tests could be conducted under the auspices of the national institutes of health metzenbaum 1985
5074852 raise any material issues of fact that require the fda to grant a hearing
5074853 because fda followed its required approval process in approving aspartame and monitors adverse reactions and ongoing aspartame research gao is making no recommendations
5074854 we did not evaluate the scientific issues raised concerning the studies used for aspartames approval or fdas resolution of these issues nor did we determine aspartames safety
5074855 although in their report the gao expresses the view that the fda followed its required process in approving aspartame for marketing i would sharply disagree with such evaluation
5074856 unfortunately this has clearly not been the case here and without this kind of assurance any such process or dance represents no more than a farce and a mockery of what is truly required
5074857 sweetener 2000 which is said to be approximately 10 000 times sweeter than sugar the chemical composition of this sweetener was not detailed in monsantos annual report nutrasweets plan was to get this new sweetener to the market by the end of the decade monsanto 1991
5074858 stipulating the nutrasweet company as their preferred supplier of aspartame monsanto 1992
5074859 between the early 1980s and 1994 scientists at the national institutes of environmental health sciences niehs proposed at least four times that the governments leading program for toxicology research fund such studies
5074860 the government scientists said they wanted the national toxicology program to conduct animal studies to resolve questions about the sweeteners cancer risks
5074861 fda has no further plans to continue to collect adverse reaction reports or monitor research periodically done on aspartame
5074862 aspartame adverse reaction reports down in1994 from 1985 peak fda
5074863 did not overtly make any threats about any actions they would take
5074864 i told them that we had already gone to press and that i wouldnt have entertained the thought of publishing a rebuttal article in the same issue anyway
5074865 apparently widely distributed his manuscript to a variety of non scientific broadcast and print media outlets we requested that hart publish a simultaneous response a request that while not unprecedented he denied
5074866 the suggestion that we attempted to suppress publication of olneys manuscript is outrageous and unfounded
5074867 the effect of oral aspartame administration on the balance of magnesium in the rat
5074868 migraine mlt down an unusual presentation of migraine in patients with aspartame triggered headaches

5074872 even the time i did in the trial 15min 03 43sec was 20sec slower than his best anyone can have an off day but youd expect him to get a gold medal
5074873 but the olympics only come round every four years and you get one or two chances at them in a lifetime you have to give it your best shot
5074874 sometimes i think it would be nice to do the 50m certainly the workload is lighter but it wouldnt appeal to me knowing one mistake and thats it you are talking about hundredths of a second making all the difference in the 1500m something can go wrong and you can do something about it
5074875 at 12 i qualified for 100m rather than the 400m in the national age groups
5074876 but when i was 15 my coach dave calleja told me to specialise in longer distances he said one day it would come together and it did
5074877 and only three of them are in atlanta theres a chance of a medal lets get to the final first
5074878 paul palmer who also qualified spoke to me afterwards and said im not going in one of your races again you go out too fast perkins will be trying to do the same so it should be interesting
5074879 we are very excited about being selected best in our category by atlanta magazine
5074880 we carry a number of great designers as well as the best of bill hallmans designs our goal is to bring the very best to atlanta and provide them at reasonable prices

5074888 the secret service seeks to reflect the broad range of society which it serves
5074889 the turn overs were the turning points in the game at newlands
5074890 it had such a profound effect on the game that in the end south africa lost quite convincingly
5074891 people can read what they want into that scoreline but had the turn overs gone south africas way it could have been a different story
5074892 its not for me to say that the wallabies will play two fetchers on saturday thats robbie deans call hes the coach but theres good reasons now for playing two fetchers
5074893 the all blacks were superb with richie mccaw leading the way with many turn overs he did it against us and again against the boks now
5074894 with the elvs games open up considerably more and you have much more offloads and if you slow down the ball teams battle to get momentum
5074895 its such a fine line for referees to make a call sometimes they do it for you and sometimes they do it against you
5074896 on saturday the boks were continuously penalised particularly in the first quarter that hurt the boks spiritually as well as on the field and they became frustrated
5074897 gang tackled the boks and forced the turnovers to set the standard for the game
5074898 the springboks just did not get there did not win because their ball was turned over at crucial times
5074899 the boks were at the effective end of richie mccaw on saturday
5074900 its always about playing the way the referee is running the game and youve got to try and play with the referee
5074901 everyone seems to have a good attitude i have 8 seniors coming back that understand how to win and that want to win it was tough last year coming off a state championship but this year the men have stepped up in practice already
5074902 we play in a class 2 conference and probably the best class 2 conference in the state of missouri you always got one of these teams that seem like theyre making the playoffs or making a run for the state championship whether its palmyra monroe city centralia one of those teams is always making a run we play in a tough class 2 conference so its not going to be a big change for us i dont think
5074903 things will be a little different this year we have a good history of tailbacks with tony hall ron janes ethan etc this year we have a variety of kids running the ball well be more versatile and tougher to defend
5074904 its like tony larussa with his outfielders he gets a chance to play a lot of guys in different positions we have a lot of good weapons at different positions
5074905 bryce is good natured off the field but a beast when he steps on to the field he is a good leader he packs about 12 kids into his vehicle and brings them to practice from clarence he is one of the best linebackers in missouri and the fact that he is just over 100 tackles away from becoming mshsaas all time tackles leader shows that
5074906 matt is like another coach i could give him a 20 word play and he remembers everything i told him he delivers the ball well and quickly
5074907 last year we were trying to feel him out this year we are used to the system and everything is going to work out
5074908 we are going to try some different spreads the t spread offense etc we are going to give the defense what they are not ready for
5074909 i am not going to pay attention to the record books i am just going to flow to the ball on defense and make plays for my team
5074910 we just need to look at our needs we have a lot of kids back but our main job is filling holes and establishing our depth chart this preseason
5074911 the high expectations are all external and out of my control we are just going to take it 1 day at a time 1 week at a time we are going try to get better so that we are playing our best football in october
5074912 our kids expect to be successful and they expect to be successful every year when you talk about expectations i dont know that in our locker room expectations this year are any different than they have been for the last four or five years weve been fortunate to have good groups of kids and good football teams for awhile here and i think each year its the same
5074913 we are balanced we have a variety of playmakers and other teams are going to have fits trying to defend us if they try to stack the box and take javis away we throw the football if they try to spread the football field on us defensively we feed to javis 30 times its a pick your poison scenario
5074914 it all starts up front we have a good defense and we must win the line of scrimmage our guys are very athletic they get to the football they are strong and tough

5075063 holding bishops accountable how lawsuits helped the catholic church confront clergy sexual abuse
5075064 the cardinals rhetoric about protecting victims and showing compassion to perpetrators and pastoral concern for incarcerated priests omits the theme on peoples minds
5075065 that theme is what is the institutional church going to do to hold officials accountable
5075066 history has shown that very little changes the behavior of the hierarchy
5075067 but history has also shown that exposing secrets does protect kids prompts victims to come forward and prods catholics and citizens to look at religious figures with a much healthier skepticism
5075068 real change could come about if the cardinal demoted church officials who concealed abuse

5075114 this is a very exciting announcement for our worldvitalrecords com members as we enter our second year we have accomplished much including having more than 24 000 paid subscribers 2 million users on our were related application on facebook and have announced 2 billion names in our two major content collections the us and world collection the number two seems to be common theme in this announcement as we enter our second stage
5075115 alongside birth marriage and death records census records are the most important building block for family historians
5075116 we feel worldvitalrecords com is set for success and we are excited to make our census records more accessible to an american audience who wouldnt normally think of find my past as the first place to look for census records
5075117 i am very excited about this partnership i remember when istg was one year old and everyone was supporting us in return im happy to partner with worldvitalrecords com because they provide a service that is affordable and easily accessible on the internet

5075124 la prioridad inmediata en la que todos estamos de acuerdo es que debemos alimentar a los hambrientos
5075125 se deben implementar medidas de pol tica dom stica que corrijan las distorsiones y no pongan en peligro la oferta junto a medidas de apoyo presupuestario y apoyo a la balanza de pagos para los pa ses m s afectados
5075126 urgimos a los pa ses a no utilizar prohibiciones a la exportaci n estos controles alientan el atesoramiento de alimentos suben los precios y perjudican a las personas m s pobres del mundo
5075127 es obvio que estas medidas resultar n en un mayor aumento de los precios
5075128 los subsidios de los pa ses ricos que distorsionan el comercio perjudican tambi n la producci n de alimentos en los pa ses pobres
5075129 una reducci n de hasta el 75 de esos subsidios
5075130 adem s de los crecientes precios de la comida vemos al mismo tiempo a los agricultores en los pa ses en v as de desarrollo plantando menos y produciendo menos debido al costo en escalada de los fertilizantes y los energ ticos
5075131 debemos hacer todos los esfuerzos para apoyar a esos agricultores para que en el pr ximo a o no veamos una escasez de alimentos m s severa a n
5075132 se debe investigar m s el impacto del cambio del cultivo de alimentos a la producci n de biocombustibles y todos los subsidios a los biocombustibles deben ser revisados

5075134 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents

5075138 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5075139 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block

5075145 the canal is not going to be the panacea for new york but it is part of the equation for the upstate economy
5075146 on our first trip in 1990 the locks were strictly commercial and it was really rough
5075147 some people would buy big bales of hay and tie them to the side of their boats to keep the boat from being swallowed up by the big holes in the canal wall
5075148 but it has improved considerably now there are barbecues picnic tables theres tie ups i cant believe how beautiful it is
5075149 we all know the history and significance of the erie canal but its really no longer a transportation facility
5075150 new yorks port is no longer dependent on the river system at all and you can only really justify public investment going forward not because something has a history
5075151 why should the people of new york subsidize yacht owners
5075152 obviously its important to the state for tourism and we dont want to see anything happen to the canal
5075153 but we dont think it should be maintained with money from thruway tolls
5075154 it acknowledges the majority of aboriginal men are not perpetrators of violence or crime
5075155 it lays down minimum standards essentially for the survival and well being of the worlds indigenous people
5075156 it attempts also to tackle some of the historical injustices they faced particularly in areas like land rights which is very often a big issue for indigenous people they get their land taken away from them and have trouble getting it back
5075157 according to the countrys national indigenous association onic 18 of the smaller indigenous groups are at risk of disappearing altogether
5075158 every year an average of 10 000 to 20 000 indigenous people are registered by national authorities after being forced to flee their lands
5075159 onic estimates the numbers could be far greater since many indigenous people do not have access to registration either because of the remoteness of their ancestral lands or because they do not speak spanish and are not familiar with the national registration system

5075176 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5075177 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5075178 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5075179 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present

5075196 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5075197 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5075198 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5075199 according to subchapter d of chapter 32 of the irs code of 1954 as amended sections 4161 and 418 1 dealers who produce less than 50 units per annum are not liable for the excise tax
5075200 in 1989 we produced only 22 units so unless we are advised otherwise we will assume we owe no excise taxes at this time
5075201 all we were trying to do was get some questions answered
5075202 cada coisa que existe no universo onde as pessoas s o bondosas e n o t m barba

5075204 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5075205 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5075206 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5075207 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5075208 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5075209 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5075210 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5075211 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5075212 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5075213 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5075214 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5075215 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5075216 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5075217 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5075218 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5075219 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5075220 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5075221 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5075222 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5075223 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5075224 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5075225 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5075226 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5075227 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5075228 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5075229 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5075230 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5075231 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5075232 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5075233 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5075234 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5075235 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5075236 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5075237 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5075238 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5075239 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5075240 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5075241 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5075242 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5075243 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5075244 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5075245 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5075246 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5075247 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5075248 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5075249 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5075250 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5075251 there is nothing in the installation data that says it has to be x number of inches away from the back of the ahu
5075252 but now the righteousness of god has been manifested apart from the law although the law and the prophets bear witness to it the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ for all who believe for there is no distinction all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god put forward as a propitiation by his blood to be received by faith
5075253 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5075254 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5075255 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ews new fall preview issue
5075256 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important information
5075257 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5075258 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5075259 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5075260 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5075261 the toll free number 1 listed is the one i call and i try to call

5075272 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5075273 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5075274 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5075275 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5075276 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5075277 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5075278 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5075279 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5075280 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5075281 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5075282 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5075283 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5075284 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5075285 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5075286 this is a planning took where all things are going
5075287 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5075288 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5075289 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5075290 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5075291 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5075292 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5075293 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5075294 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5075295 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5075296 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5075297 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5075298 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5075299 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5075300 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5075301 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5075302 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5075303 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5075304 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5075305 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5075306 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5075307 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5075308 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5075309 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5075310 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5075311 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5075312 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5075313 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5075314 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5075315 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5075316 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5075317 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5075318 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5075319 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5075320 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5075321 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5075322 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5075323 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5075324 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5075325 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5075326 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5075327 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5075328 the toll free number 1 listed is the one i call and i try to call
5075329 the center for constitutional rights does not tell people the justice department will prosecute someone

5075360 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
5075361 adolescents are faced with so many influences that contribute to smoking attitudes and behaviors to find that a simple household rule that bans smoking in the home has a meaningful impact on smoking attitudes and behaviors is somewhat surprising
5075362 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior

5075393 o ex rcito e o governo me deixaram s e a nica coisa que pe o que me ajudem a sair desta situa o
5075394 all i can do is be me whoever that is
5075395 this is the first time i know who i am
5075396 in the first half we had our backs to the wall a fair bit i was probably disappointed with some of the penalties i think for both teams
5075397 we were on the receiving end and then towards the end of the game it looked like sutton was evening the ledger i thought they were hard done by getting a bloke sent to the sin bin
5075398 i dont know where that came from all those little things slowed the game down lets get the game going
5075399 the second half we had more ball but just at vital stages we coughed it up when we started to build pressure and looked like we were going to get the ascendancy
5075400 every man woman and child when he had the chance
5075401 i told you it was a good idea to tell those people about killing every man woman and child
5075402 from a physical perspective now whats doing coming off a knee reconstruction is unbelievable really
5075403 hes probably become a genuine midfielder now playing on some of the best midfielders in the competition
5075404 so full credit to him hes been a desperate man and he wants to continue his career which is great
5075405 what we can do is look forward to the future and learn that if we can do it week in week out and to compete with a team like manly the way we did today thats really exciting for the club
5075406 weve just got to learn to do it week in week out thats the challenge for us now
5075407 the disappointing things about the losses that weve had in the last few weeks we really werent in the games because the intensitys just been down
5075408 that was always a good chance of happening it was going to be hard for them
5075409 everybody who watched the game last friday night realised how much manly put into it its always hard to back up particularly when youre playing a team thats not going to be there at the end
5075410 id like to think were a better footy club than that
5075411 im not sure what affected us today but something did we just didnt turn up with the right mindset
5075412 weve just got to think about next week to tell you the truth im not too concerned
5075413 the win is extremely important to start off at home
5075414 i think we were a little rusty at times in the first half but certainly the second we got a bit more cohesion so i was really pleased with how we finished off the game
5075415 once we went a goal down we had to look at trying to get in behind them their centre backs are quite slow so we wanted to inject a bit of pace but we just couldnt get the right ball to nikita
5075416 as much as interstate wins are difficult you only get four points so what it means is we stay in the eight and weve got destiny in our own control thats what it means
5075417 whats momentum im not being smart but everyone talks about momentum and gee whiz weve one won we just get some confidence back that gee we are a reasonable team
5075418 well i tell you what you cant win finals and play in them until youre in them and we are clearly not in them so that questions irrelevant
5075419 everyone led but in particular at the pointy end riewoldt and lenny hayes were outstanding
5075420 he riewoldt is our captain he plays with presence the bottom line is you need your leaders playing well and he did that today
5075421 he didnt want to have a farewell game himself hes one of those guys that doesnt like the attention of playing the last game
5075422 its upset a lot of people here because it was such an incredibly beautiful day and people are at a loss to understand the two accidents within the resort because of the weather and the fact that they were in uncrowded areas when it occurred

5075424 its a bit strange for us really because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through

5075454 your decisions are strongly prepared by brain activity by the time consciousness kicks in most of the work has already been done
5075455 real life decisions am i going to buy this house or that one take this job or that arent decisions that we can implement very well in our brain scanners
5075456 we cant rule out that theres a free will that kicks in at this late point
5075457 its not like youre a machine your brain activity is the physiological substance in which your personality and wishes and desires operate
5075458 thats the same notion as the mind being separate from the body and i dont think anyone really believes that
5075459 a different way of thinking about it is that your consciousness is only aware of some of the things your brain is doing

5075464 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5075465 before the forum takes place let me say how weird the whole event appears to me as a catholic priest first my understanding is that the forum will take place in the sanctuary of the saddleback church i think that is inappropriate a church hall would be ok but not the sanctuary which should be reserved for worship service this is not a question of separation of church and state i leave that to the constitutional lawyers this is a question of what is religiously appropriate and inappropriate to do in churches catholics appear to have a very different standard than evangelicals both white and black the vatican is even opposed to holding concerts in churches second imagine for a second that the forum was being sponsored by cardinal francis george of chicago and was held in the sanctuary of his cathedral the outcry would be defining the public and the media appear more easily to accept political activity by evangelical clergy than by catholic clergy catholic clergy are held to a higher standard for example pat robertson and jesse jackson can run for president but imagine what would happen if cardinal george or cardinal egan ran for president dont get me wrong i do not want catholic cardinals or clergy publicly getting involved in partisan politics i am happy that canon law and tradition restrict political activity by catholic clergy i just wonder if there is a double standard here

5075478 dan jika kamu tetap dalam keraguan tentang yang kami wahyukan kepada hamba kami muhammad buatlah satu surat saja yang semisal itu dan ajaklah penolong penolongmu selain allah jika kamu memang orang orang yang benar
5075479 sesungguhnya kami lah yang menurunkan dan sesungguhnya kami benar benar memeliharanya
5075480 mengapa kamu kafir kepada allah padahal kamu tadinya mati lalu allah menghidupkan kamu kemudian kamu dimatikan dan dihidupkan kembali kemudian kepada nya kamu dikembalikan
5075481 dan carilah pada apa yang telah dianugerahkan allah kepadamu kebahagiaan negeri akhirat dan janganlah kamu melupakan bagianmu dari kenikmatan duniawi
5075482 sesungguhnya allah telah membeli dari orang orang mukmin diri dan harta mereka dengan memberikan surga untuk mereka
5075483 dan janganlah sekali kali kebencianmu terhadap suatu kaum mendorong kamu berlaku tidak adil
5075484 hai orang orang yang beriman taatilah allah dan rasul nya dan ulil amri diantara kamu
5075485 dan hendaklah kamu memutuskan perkara diantara mereka menurut apa yang diturunkan allah dan janganlah kamu mengikuti hawa nafsu mereka
5075486 kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah dan rasul nya sunnahnya
5075487 supaya harta itu jangan hanya beredar di antara orang orang kaya saja di antara kamu

5075492 bila suatu kaum berkumpul pada salah satu rumah rumah allah masjid dimana mereka membaca dan mempelajari maka turunlah ketenangan ditengah tengah mereka serta mereka selalu diliputi oleh rahmat dikerumuni oleh malaikat dan disebut sebut allah swt didepan malaikat yang berada di sisi nya

5075568 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5075569 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5075570 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response
5075571 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5075572 we are on a clear road towards nato membership for georgia
5075573 i am looking forward to the speedy withdrawal of russian troops which has not yet happened as we had expected
5075574 to show that we support the georgian people and also the government to deal with the work there is to do
5075575 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
5075576 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the commonwealth of independent states cis
5075577 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces

5075580 president bush even refused our request to suspend buying oil at record prices for the federal stockpile until we passed a law and the price fell by over 20 a barrel
5075581 a u s probe into whether speculators manipulated oil prices up to more than 135 a barrel is a waste of time billionaire hedge fund manager boone pickens said yesterday theres nothing to it to start with pickens said
5075582 scapegoat for what is largely a supply and demand problem
5075583 energy entrepreneur t boone pickens says that speculation has become a scapegoat for what is largely a supply and demand problem
5075584 over the past few months alone republicans have voted down our efforts to expand domestic drilling opposed clean energy alternatives and rejected requiring oil companies to produce from the public lands they already control
5075585 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth with oil prices still above 100 a barrel that charge never made sense

5075601 we had pushed into the twisted forests and had our first unfortunate encounter with the apparently part human creatures that dwelt there then the factory siren began to sound heralding our unpleasant welcome
5075602 take heart doctor i cant imagine creatures like this have a ready supply of bullets every time they fire at us and miss is a cause for optimism
5075603 an automated turret ive faced those kinds of things before in the danegeld war weve got no chance without armoured vehicles or a couple of weeks and a dedicated team of trench diggers
5075604 but theyd have to be a lot more technically minded than id have thought
5075605 the forest creatures know this ground better than we do if we can get this close then theres no reason they couldnt we have to either get back out there or
5075606 or get on the right side of those turrets hallo whos this
5075607 if youre looking for a safe place in the forests youve found it who are you you look unchanged can i trust you
5075608 were a team of explorers from fortress city aid us and youll be handsomely rewarded
5075609 well our company is a kind of reward in itself surely
5075610 move quickly the first forest dweller i see theyre coming back on and they wont distinguish friend from foe
5075611 how long have you been holed up in this old place
5075612 i wondered if i was the last one left the last human i mean this is the portman family house i was their gamekeeper im the last of this household left at least
5075613 toys to keep foxes from the pheasants originally peashooters almost originally
5075614 but we dont intend to get bogged down here we need to move on as soon as possible we need to know everything about the surrounding land do these forest dwellers keep your house under constant observation for example will we be able to get back out
5075615 i dont know i did once but that was a long time ago or maybe not so long i cant tell

5075624 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5075625 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

5075639 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5075640 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5075641 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5075642 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5075643 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5075644 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5075645 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5075646 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5075647 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5075648 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5075649 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5075650 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5075651 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5075652 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5075653 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5075659 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5075660 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5075661 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5075662 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5075663 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5075664 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5075665 who are open to doing something on the production side
5075666 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5075667 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5075668 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5075669 no solo es grande la emoci n por haber cantado con los presidentes un gesto muy lindo de parte de ellos sino tambi n por lo que representa este momento hist rico que estamos viviendo esto ha sido realmente una fiesta algo sin palabras hasta el momento

5075671 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5075672 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5075673 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5075674 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5075675 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5075676 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5075677 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5075678 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5075679 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5075680 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5075681 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5075682 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5075683 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5075695 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5075696 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5075697 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5075698 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5075699 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5075700 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5075701 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5075702 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5075703 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5075704 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5075705 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5075706 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5075707 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5075708 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5075709 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5075710 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5075711 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5075712 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5075713 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5075714 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5075715 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5075716 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5075717 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5075718 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5075719 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5075720 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5075721 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5075722 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5075723 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5075724 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5075725 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5075726 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5075727 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5075728 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5075729 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

5075742 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5075743 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5075744 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5075745 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
5075746 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
5075747 i think senator obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
5075748 florida has not yet been locked down by either candidate or all but won by either candidate but i think obamas inability to prove his experience or prove that he owns a political issue far more than mccain is a real problem for him
5075749 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an evan bayh or a joe biden as vice president would help a lot with that
5075750 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience
5075751 in rural parts of georgia and the south there is still some fear about people who look different from themselves
5075752 and theres also healing left to do among women who wanted to see the day that a woman was elected president
5075753 i would really like to see him do things in tennessee that would help in other working class and blue collar places like ohio

5075766 everybody was ready to say yes but i never managed to get the finance together
5075767 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5075768 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5075769 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5075770 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5075771 for me it confirms to all these doubters that i am fit enough to do this

5075777 dont know what you have until hes out of the lineup
5075778 by managements own admission merchant bankers have not been appointed for the ipo so how has the price been established and announced
5075779 declaring a price range without the requisite due diligence or engagement with merchant bankers is a reckless move
5075780 this low share price is extremely damaging for bsnl and should invite the regulators scrutiny
5075781 the logical route for any company looking to raise funds is to restructure its operations to create maximum shareholder value and appoint merchant bankers before going to the market
5075782 thinking out of the box as they say for radically different solutions

5075789 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5075790 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5075791 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5075792 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5075793 i think local councils need to be given more powers to turn these applications down where they are really not wanted
5075794 i am grateful for the support demonstrated but i will only be satisfied once action occurs
5075795 i now urge the government to act on the responses to the consultation and ensure that the licensing laws are changed
5075796 this is not about moralising this bill does not seek to ban lap dancing clubs it merely seeks to strengthen and add to the criteria that can be taken into consideration when deciding whether to license one in a particular location
5075797 in durham a club was granted a license by the city council in a completely inappropriate location and this has happened all over the country
5075798 i think local councils need to be given more powers to turn these applications down where they are really not wanted
5075799 i raised this matter in a debate some months ago and i was pleased with the response by the minister then
5075800 i hope that my bill and the level of support i believe it has among members of parliament will push the government into action and get them to change the licensing regime for these clubs

5075823 we wish him nothing but the best in the future
5075824 this is not my house this bedroom its not mine
5075825 but theres anxiety because its like trying out for a team and not knowing how many positions there are
5075826 at this point the decision is to not run a cope mayoral candidate if we can reach an agreement with vision
5075827 but if we cant reach an agreement we would run a cope mayoral candidate
5075828 the average npa candidate can count on about 50 000 votes and a candidate on a united left slate about 60 000 votes
5075829 this means a united left can always beat a united right however any split on the left dilutes these totals to about 40 000 for left council candidates
5075830 the high vision numbers could cause the party problems as they have yet to announce how many candidates they are going to field
5075831 and those who lose the nominations might feel cheated if they have put a lot of time and effort into their nominations only to find that they had no chance to begin with
5075832 realistic chance of holding a majority on council but could ensure an npa victory by running its own mayoralty candidate and a close to full slate of candidates
5075833 i was panicking during the meet because i didnt feel good whatsoever and it showed it was a challenge but luckily i was able to make the top 12
5075834 it was a real struggle for me because i didnt feel like myself out there
5075835 and when you dont feel like yourself you lose confidence it was like just do the best that you can do to be your normal self and thats what i did
5075836 so it was a good dive but im going to leave what happened last night at the pool and start all over again

5075850 one of those days jesus went out to a mountainside to pray and spent the night praying to god when morning came he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them whom he also designated apostles
5075851 he went down with them and stood on a level place a large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over judea from jerusalem and from the coastal region around tyre and sidon who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases those troubled by evil spirits were cured and the people all tried to touch him because power was coming from him and healing them all
5075852 jesus replied love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
5075853 a new command i give you love one another as i have loved you so you must love one another by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another
5075854 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
5075855 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
5075856 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
5075857 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
5075858 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
5075859 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
5075860 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
5075861 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
5075862 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
5075863 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
5075864 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning
5075865 in a way its just a microcosm that can stand in for the disappointment that people are feeling in more real and concrete and significant ways about how things have not changed in china
5075866 the opening ceremonies wiped all that away like holy crap did they ever do a good job this was really freakin amazing i think most of us were really impressed
5075867 and then the next day here it is again smog of a different sort the tarnish that was gone suddenly showed up again
5075868 of course it was beautiful and i enjoyed it very much but i feel a little duped it takes away from the magic of the whole show

5075879 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5075880 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5075881 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5075882 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5075883 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5075884 what just happened what did we resolve the answer was nada or close to it imagine if you only had 2 hours to come up with ideas to save your company
5075885 get to the point and dont repeat the point 3 times please
5075886 i got it i got it and you told me that why
5075887 am i sharing this with you because you need to hear it or do i just want to hear myself say it what is my true agenda am i wasting your time to inflate my ego
5075888 did i tell you that because you needed to hear it or did i just want to hear myself say it did i concisely relay my information did i fluff my feathers

5075898 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5075899 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block

5075909 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5075910 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5075911 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5075912 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5075913 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear

5075930 well if i can get more money for an arena in pittsburgh than in kansas city im staying here

5075939 it was supposed to be just junk there definitely is violent content but theyre taking it out of context and making it something it isnt
5075940 we keep deluding ourselves and getting caught up in distractions that have nothing at all to do with what is setting back holding black people back and its our own self hatred don imus is irrelevant to what is going on with black people don imus is no threat to us don imus will not shoot one of us in the street he will not impregnate our daughter or our sister and abandon that kid and that woman

5075961 climate science has recommended an inversion of the focus where the first step is to identify local and regional vulnerabilities to key resources e g food energy water to determine the magnitude of changes in climate and other environmental conditions that would result in a negative effect on these essential resources we do not need a global climate model prediction to do this rather we need the involvement of the social science community which ncar under the direction of rick anthes has elected to cut this was a short sighted decision which is clearly based on focusing funds in order to support greater computing and observational power while climate science agrees that funds are needed to improve our understanding of the climate system on decadal time scales the assessment of model predictability the use of climate models and observations for process studies and diagnostic analyses a significant amount of funds should be allocated for the assessment of societal and environmental vulnerabilities ncars and ucars decision to cut the social science program at ncar has removed an effective program to examine these vulnerabilities

5075974 entomologists have yet to identify the culprit that causes ccd
5075975 you need look no farther than a california almond orchard to understand how these bees could have gotten into such trouble
5075976 is that almonds today are grown in such vast monocultures 80 percent of the worlds crop comes from a 600 000 acre swath of orchard in californias central valley that when the trees come into bloom for three weeks every february there are simply not enough bees in the valley to pollinate all those flowers
5075977 more than half of all the beehives in america are on the move to california every february to pollinate almond trees
5075978 californias almond orchards have become a place where each february bees swap microbes and parasites from all over the country and the world before returning home bearing whatever pathogens they may have picked up add to this their routine exposure to agricultural pesticides and you have a bee population ripe for an epidemic national in scope
5075979 entomologists have yet to identify the culprit that causes ccd
5075980 thats a 40 year cycle and the next occurrence would be guess when the 2000s or right about now

5076139 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5076140 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5076141 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5076142 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5076143 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5076144 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5076145 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5076146 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5076147 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5076148 hes definitely much more relaxed than you would think he was
5076149 he has been in this offense for what a week as fast as he has been getting everything its ridiculous
5076150 the community had been raising red flags for months and sometimes years
5076151 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5076152 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved
5076153 this wasnt any building this was a public spectacle this was a high rise toxic vacant building that was under deconstruction
5076154 we cannot afford to have anyone else lose their life
5076155 if that means its going to take a little bit longer to take the building down then its going to take a little bit longer
5076156 what is it about evolution theory that albertans dont get
5076157 everybody i gave an afghan to is just in awe
5076158 been designed from the ground up for use in rural africa able to handle
5076159 ive heard about 70 000 people at raven stadium staying after the preseason game to watch the relay on the big screen
5076160 four years ago that wouldnt even be theres no way that would ever happen so i think the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further thats why i hope to take it even further
5076161 well i grew up swimming so to watch someone do something as impressive as this awesome especially for our country too unites us all its awesome
5076162 the very special thing to me was watching his emotions
5076163 medication issues continue to haunt this industry and they are and will continue to be a priority for this committee as evidenced by several of todays recommendations
5076164 we once again vigorously encourage the respective industry organizations to act on these recommendations in a timely manner
5076165 weve got to do that its the appropriate scientific step and its the direction we need to go in
5076166 develop a business plan for the most efficient and cost effective infrastructure for equine drug testing and research
5076167 if the eight belles tragedy makes us all more cooperative less inward looking more proactive and more sensitive to how our sport is perceived by others then eight belles may be viewed in years to come as one of the most important horses ever to step on a racetrack
5076168 the thoroughbred safety committee strongly encourages all state racing commissions to publish the tco2 total carbon dioxide levels of each horse tested to ensure the public that testing is being conducted and participants are below the regulatory thresholds
5076169 to keep suspended trainers from participating in the training of racehorses and or benefiting financially or otherwise from said training
5076170 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
5076171 i just dont want to splash the water on him yet you know what i mean
5076172 heres the thing hes had great vision hes made some heads up plays and weve had success i really like all that maybe i want more but i want better technique i want him to use the kind of techniques that are going to take him further down the road remember we were talking differently last week after the buffalo game oh colt came down to earth well now hes in outer space again
5076173 hes having fun but theres a lot more distance that he has to go he shouldnt be strutting his stuff
5076174 i saw him putting ice down his back in the first quarter and im thinking thats kind of funny he was trying to cool himself off it was like midway through the first quarter
5076175 the rhythm was a little off and i think he fought through it he wasnt sure of the first thing he wanted to do and ive got to get him to help himself with his gut feel because he had the right decisions at first and he just wanted it to be better and he didnt need it to be its just inexperience
5076176 he didnt see it didnt focus on it and he turned back in and tried to throw the ball back over the middle to the tight end and it wasnt there
5076177 its put a lot of pressure on us as coaches
5076178 faith and i have joked about doing on golden pond on broadway when we get older
5076179 i get asked about beyonce all the time but i try and make fun of it
5076180 hsv are one of the biggest clubs in the bundesliga and are the only ones to have remained in the league since their inception
5076181 i was already at one of the biggest clubs with dortmund but hamburg are certainly a cut above
5076182 i am looking forward to joining the club and obviously coach jurgen klopp
5076183 i struggled on the back nine i got a little bit stressed after the two bogeys but i started pretty well
5076184 for me it has been difficult to get that second title its been a long wait
5076185 as long as they are not found guilty they remain only accused and there is nothing authorities can do about the couple
5076186 mu jak je izgledao kao da e umreti od sr anog udara
5076187 zum ersten mal ist ein verband der spieleindustrie im kulturellen politikumfeld institutionell verankert worden damit ist die spieleindustrie endg ltig im kulturellen bereich angekommen das ist ein gro er tag f r die deutsche spieleindustrie
5076188 with carl crawford and evan longoria going down simultaneously i thought id make one last vain attempt to reach out to tampa bay and to no avail
5076189 thats because major league baseball has been successful in their pursuit in blackballing barry out of the game
5076190 im not sure what jeff borris is trying to accomplish by saying he sent me a text message
5076191 but our longstanding practice is not to comment on anything speculative
5076192 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5076193 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5076194 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5076195 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5076196 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5076197 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5076198 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5076199 to have your number retired its one of the greatest things that could ever happen to you
5076200 i knew the significance of it so i was nervous i havent been this nervous in a long time
5076201 i played the game i dearly loved to play since i was a kid
5076202 they gave me a number and now its hanging from the rafters
5076203 we sat next to each other for so many years we had a great ride
5076204 the next time itll be 2013 when youre a first ballot hall of famer
5076205 ive been out here several times and the support has always been great but this has been another level
5076206 the courts have recognized that in ballot arguments proponents are allowed to engage in hyperbole
5076207 sarah was only 15 when she had a secret abortion
5076208 had someone in her family known about the abortion sarahs life could have been saved
5076209 legislators ignore the will of plurality of voters at their own electoral risk
5076210 the throw the bums out attitude would cause a lot of pain
5076211 despite my acquittal it is easy to see that voters can have doubts about my character given what the media unfairly wrote about me
5076212 their tabloid like reporting has tarnished my reputation in this community and made it more difficult to seek re election
5076213 the attorney they hired has attempted to denigrate me in the press by misrepresenting my actions and most of the time outright lying about the facts of the case
5076214 if theres any distortion of the facts i would suggest its by the senator who has a fanciful or inaccurate recollection of what actually occurred
5076215 i was expecting to be on a host committee to honor katrina survivors
5076216 i dont think i knew that as well as i know that now
5076217 look globally where people are oppressed and there are not libraries
5076218 look globally where people are oppressed and there are not libraries
5076219 the democratic process begins to strengthen because of the information
5076220 library from you i have the total of my wisdom and so this poem is for you
5076221 and because you have illuminated my days today i give you my gratitude
5076222 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5076223 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5076224 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5076225 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5076226 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5076227 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5076228 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5076229 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5076230 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5076231 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5076232 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5076233 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5076234 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5076235 how on earth will six girls going to fit on that stage
5076236 wir hatten in der woche einige r ckschl ge zu verkraften wir haben schlecht angefangen und es in der zweiten h lfte besser gemacht ich bin froh dass wir gewonnen haben und besser gestartet sind als in der vergangenen saison

5076265 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5076266 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5076267 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5076268 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5076269 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5076270 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5076271 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5076272 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5076273 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5076274 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5076275 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5076276 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5076277 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5076278 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5076279 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
5076280 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
5076281 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
5076282 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
5076283 if youre just talking about income how about five million
5076284 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
5076285 this might be the beginning of the end of he american empire
5076286 it was a fairly straight forward race from my perspective i was able to pull out a little bit of a gap on john and just tried to maintain that until the end hopefully we can go on to mosport next weekend have a similar result and get back into the championship battle
5076287 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5076288 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5076289 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5076290 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead some shops nearby were damaged he said
5076291 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself

5076295 hey man dont hate on me or anything but are you two on your first date my buddy and i were wondering and were never usually wrong

5076299 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5076300 a value is a value to me only when i see the value of the value as valuable to me
5076301 many people in the party believe the next prime minister should be ldp secretary general taro aso i have the same opinion
5076302 this is my dream come true im very satisfied with the result
5076303 you cant go out and say you will win a medal you must make it happen
5076304 so i couldnt show my best obviously i wanted the gold but im satisfied because this is the olympic games
5076305 you know it is the last chance i must try my best in the olympics everybody will try their best
5076306 we all really wanted to stand on the podium together and see the japanese flag raised
5076307 in the individual events its just me but in this one we all had to put our strength together
5076308 there is a lot of fuss being made over these reports that i have already made up my mind to retire
5076309 i will go home and make my decision about what to do retiring is a possibility but i need time to think it over
5076310 thats all i could do im a little upset about the heat
5076311 the injury was a setback to my training but thats no excuse because my hamstring feels fine
5076312 i feel great i feel strong i feel relaxed it just wasnt there
5076313 i just didnt have nothing in me today i ran as fast as i could i gave it 100 percent
5076314 i got a good start i was fortunate i started feeling tired towards the middle
5076315 i guess it will probably set in later on i could have been a little better
5076316 in spite of the extraordinary efforts of a large team of people in the united kingdom and japan it is with great sadness and disappointment therefore that our team has decided that it is now unlikely that we are able to proceed with our project to bring a major exhibition to tokyo as currently envisaged time has simply run out
5076317 describes his job as throwing spitballs from the back of the room and points out that the daily show mandate is to entertain not inform
5076318 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
5076319 perhaps my heart should have been crude as crude oil could be made black as the sea perhaps salty like the red in the east
5076320 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5076321 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5076322 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5076323 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5076324 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5076325 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5076326 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5076327 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5076328 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5076329 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5076330 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5076331 i dont think you can control the entire world from one centre
5076332 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5076333 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus and afghanistan
5076334 iran is definitely having some influence on these issues so we are talking
5076335 im going to poland to sign a missile defense agreement in the next couple of days after the nato meeting
5076336 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well

5076386 while the planning officials were very keen to accommodate mr flatleys housing needs in co kerry it was generally felt that a palladian house of around 70 000 sq feet would be excessive in this location
5076387 there is a history in kerry of large houses being permitted in the area
5076388 this would be like a small factory to the area and the county will be sending out all the wrong messages if it does not get the go ahead
5076389 i felt that without chiharu also getting gold i had lost my motivation to fight but she told me to forget that and go for gold
5076390 even though we both didnt win gold like we had aimed i believe we won this gold together
5076391 i was so tired after that match that i could hardly walk but it was really just because of my feeling for my sister that i think i was able to win it

5076399 the fewer people who know about unix the better at that point i decided if i wanted a unix like system to teach id have to write one myself so i did
5076400 if you could be the author of any operating system other than minix which os would you choose
5076401 why freebsd and why do you think its still not that widely known as a free o s among the computer buying public
5076402 it is much more solid than linux and better structured internally
5076403 whats the reason for the bsd license for minix rather than the gpl
5076404 people who know the history of your usenet spat with linus were probably amused to see you put in a position to defend him you said that if linus had been your student he would have got an f for linux
5076405 i dont dislike linus or anything we exchanged some messages about kernel structure for a week on the net were not the hatfields and the mccoys
5076406 his view of the mach microkernel in mac os x is frankly its a piece of crap it contains all the design mistakes you can make and managed to even make up a few of its own do you still think he was right
5076407 mach wasnt very good so os 360 was a monolithic operating system and was pretty crummy does that mean linux also a monolithic system is also pretty crummy
5076408 of minix 3 you have said the new goal is for it to be usable as a serious system on resource limited and embedded computers and for applications requiring high reliability
5076409 what effect does the unlinking of hardware and the os though hypervisors and others have on os design
5076410 hard to tell at this point my first guess is not very much due to so much legacy in the long run i expect hypervisors to be quite important
5076411 what do you think will be the most important change to os design over the next 10 years
5076412 multicore chips are coming and the oses have to deal with that however parallel programming is extremely difficult and i foresee a lot of unreliable code as a result another thing that i see happening is that pcs will be losing market share in the computing world to ipods mp3 players pdas and mobile devices in these applications people expect much higher reliability than pcs normally offer
5076413 do you think microsoft should follow apple and use a bsd clone as the basis of their next system
5076414 fine with me but it is not going to happen
5076415 maybe 20 billion in legacy investment may 500 million users who would scream bloody murder if all their applications didnt run on the new system exactly as they did on the old one
5076416 i think there is a world market for maybe five computers at some point probably not too far point in the future do you think there will be millions of computers or will there just be one
5076417 at that time computers cost 30 million and just computed tables of sines and cosines i think everything that is electrical is going to have a computer in it before 10 years they will all be connected by fibre and wireless it will be a completely connected world
5076418 whats your view of the trusted computing platform given that it could be used to block open source software or to enforce draconian digital rights management
5076419 it is a niche but in that niche i think it will do well i see if for companies who need a variable amount of server capacity and also for users to store photos and data long term
5076420 do you think bill gates is right when he says the us economy will not fall into a slump because technological progress will help it grow

5076425 terrible idea if you break the law you should expect to be punished for it
5076426 why do you think obama was successful in raising over 6 9m using the web as a fund raising platform
5076427 he raised a lot more than that on the web i think a lot of people are sick of george bush and he was young and spoke to the right demographic and upscale professionals these are the people who are the most sick of george bush and the most present on the web as an aside howard dean did the same thing last time the difference is that obama won the iowa caucuses and dean didnt

5076473 kevin heeft wat ons betreft een heel slimme agent die weet wat hij nu nodig heeft eerst hard aan zijn
5076474 hetzelfde geldt voor ariscoach pete miller we kunnen zien dat kevin een atletiekachtergrond heeft hij sjokt niet achter de fast break aan maar is met krachtige passen razendsnel aan de overkant dat zie je niet vaak bij iemand van zijn lengte daarnaast heeft hij veel wilskracht en een enorme drang om ver te komen in het profbasketbal en hij heeft dus een goed schot wordt dat wat beter net als zijn explosiviteit dan zou hij in de nba zelfs op de drie kunnen spelen maar kevin richt zich nu op een europese loopbaan dan kan de nba nog altijd zijn eindstation zijn
5076475 zo gaat ook aris hem inzetten de laatste man die ze contracteren zal een buffelaar zijn voor onder de borden eentje die goed kan rebounden dan staat er een team dat defensief heel sterk is alle starters zijn van origine goede verdedigers en hebben daar prijzen of nominaties mee verdiend eiffeltowers en coach randy wiel in het bijzonder richt zich van oudsher vooral op offensief sterke spelers dat wij vanuit friesland mannen terugkrijgen die van pete miller n g beter hebben leren verdedigen zien wij als een groot winstpunt van onze samenwerking

5076481 that because he helped west vancouver independent mp blair wilson with his problems with the federal liberal green light committee he will not receive the blessing of the provincial equivalent
5076482 they threatened me for helping blair but not so i can prove anything and i told them to go f k themselves it does not take a political wonder child to do the political math on this one i am toast but at least i can hold my head high
5076483 his claim that the provincial liberals will not give him the green light because of his involvement with blair wilson is just self serving nonsense if the provincial liberals wont give him the green light it is because of his highly publicized actions on and off council
5076484 if the liberals are giving fearnley a big red light its because they have a more than sneaking suspicion that the voters of north van lonsdale would give him exactly the same thing
5076485 with his record he represents a real albatross for the liberal party in north van no matter how strong it seems

5076493 we moved out here not only to be away from the traffic and the noise and the floods and hurricanes but to come up here where its a little more peaceful and quiet and were close to nature
5076494 the fact remains that some of the planning for this has taken place without the general knowledge of a lot of the residents of this community a lot of it has been kept on the qt thats my opinion

5076523 he was right about afghanistan finally john mccain is coming around on that he was right about engaging iran george bush has come around on that and he was right about georgia months ago he was calling for this conflict to be diffused instead the president and john mccain are so obsessed with iraq we dropped the ball if wed listened to senator obama and his judgment perhaps we wouldnt be here today

5076540 i had a pretty good start and i felt that i was with usain to about 50 meters and i just remember him pulling away after that i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the final line
5076541 hes a phenomenal athlete i dont think theres any way anyone couldve beaten him with a run like that
5076542 i really cant say exactly how it felt until after i crossed the line and looked at the clock and he ran a world record
5076543 usain bolt is a great athlete to run a world record in the olympic final

5076600 my wrongdoing is there for all to see and ive got to move on
5076601 what i am proud of is the performance of the new zealand team three medals for rowing is just fantastic the platform was set and they performed but i dont take any credit for that i didnt expect any less from them
5076602 all the italian boats were faster than the new zealand boats
5076603 in my position i wasnt going to say you cant have them
5076604 i wanted the athletes to have the best possible tools its no good having world class athletes if you havent got the best possible boats
5076605 hell be back i reflect on the effort of cyclist sarah ulmer in sydney in 2000 where she was ill and she won in athens mahe can do that as well
5076606 people come to new zealand and dont understand just how fast the weather can change
5076607 they are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5076608 just the last couple of days sitting around in a tent watching helicopters go in the wrong direction looking for us not what i went there hoping for
5076609 you can get weather like that in summer you just get more of it in winter
5076610 it was a good time of year for us to go up there and its not crowded with other people
5076611 right now everything looks good for the first two days
5076612 the concern is once the storm goes over water it can pick up steam well wait and see what city and state officials say as far as evacuating
5076613 arguably the most imposing scientific and technical challenge that humanity ever faced
5076614 major disruptions on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the twentieth century
5076615 i think that the business enterprises that are going to allow the north american economy to be relevant you know fifteen years from now are going to be those business enterprises that have devoted themselves to providing services that enhance the quality of peoples lives in a very holistic way
5076616 nothing to feel in death good can be attained evil can be endured
5076617 plain fare gives us as much pleasure as a costly diet
5076618 epicuruss philosophy exercised so widespread an influence that for a long time it was touch and go whether christianity might not have to give way before it
5076619 this is the only place in the world where we know for certain that a greco roman library was entombed in a manner that ensured its preservation
5076620 there are almost certainly more books to be found there
5076621 the villa remains one of the great buildings of the ancient world and it should certainly be excavated
5076622 this would be true even if we were to find no further papyri though the likelihood that we will find them adds much to the case the building will certainly contain many other things and is of unique historical interest if we know of a site that should be excavated and we have the capacity let us get on with it of all the sites in the world this one ranks close to the top of the list for potential and historical importance
5076623 we have a big problem with the water if we excavate here after one month we have a metre of water
5076624 they make this cavity this cave it is not soclear and they bring into view only a small part and when they finish we have to manage the cave
5076625 our task is to preserve what is found but it is very difficult to project an entire excavation digging at the villa thats a huge undertaking we would have to change streets demolish houses and change the lives of thousands of people in ercolano and portici it is a problem for the mayors it is a political decision in the true sense of the word
5076626 for me they must open and read all the papyri they have had for centuries before we look for others
5076627 if i want to eat a meal at my home i dont go to the supermarket if i have a full fridge
5076628 parts of the villa where the ancient diggers dont go
5076629 but they are not what can we do about nature
5076630 today i think the method of archeology is not to find treasures
5076631 it is amazing to claim that it is treasure hunting when one asks to have the papyri excavated before vesuvius buries them definitively
5076632 if lava flows over the site again i doubt we will ever have access to them
5076633 as for the publication of all the papyri being demanded before more are excavated might one ask that the whole of pompeii and herculaneum be properly published before anything more there is unearthed it seems to me to be arrogance to deny future generations the opportunity to read more such books just because there are at present very few classical scholars with the competence and the energy to decipher and bring out those that we do have
5076634 there are of course serious issues about conservation and the interface with the modern city which are not to be dismissed lightly
5076635 they are solvable there is huge potential also for an excavation to contribute to the local economy and urban regeneration if agreement could be reached on options
5076636 empty is that philosophers argument by which no human suffering is therapeutically treated
5076637 for just as there is no use for a medical art that does not cast out the sickness of the body so there is no use in philosophy unless it casts out the sickness of the soul

5076656 the idea is to use women from our target market who embody the spirit of the wonderbra and feel happy showing themselves feeling good wearing our bras

5076664 the literacy rate of our women is very low they have no economic independence they have accepted poverty as an act of fate and their personalities have been suppressed they have no confidence they are afraid to think and they are in a state of laziness of thought they are inclined to believe in superstitions they are ineffective inside the family they have no knowledge of our central asian roots the properties of our matriarchal family structural have been erased from their minds their personalities are mostly cowardly or they dont care about others they are under sexual oppression their religious preferences are under the influence of men

5076687 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5076688 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5076689 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference

5076699 gli avevamo offerto un accordo tecnico tra le nostre liste e le loro abbiamo ricevuto un no presunzione o paura di contaminazione
5076700 la prima cosa chiedersi perch si torna o si ritorna a parlare di questione socialista visto che nulla avviene anche in politica per caso la mia risposta perch i socialisti non sono scomparsi
5076701 abbiamo ricevuto un no e questo no stato un errore di presunzione o un no per la paura di una contaminazione
5076702 e bene che si sappia una cosa i socialisti sono attrezzati ad aprire anche oggi una discussione sulla necessit di un nuovo revisionismo socialista ma bertinotti vuole attendere il 14 aprile perch ma perch forse teme ferrando e turigliatto perch non vuole turbare i fedeli della mummia di lenin
5076703 c poi dellaltro la verit che la sinistra se non perde non impara la lezione della storia
5076704 la sinistra non vuole mai prevedere la crisi propria perch crede che la crisi sia presente solo nel campo avverso e questa presunzione la mette nella spiacevole situazione che dopo ogni significativo evento politico deve sempre ricominciare daccapo
5076705 e vero che noi socialisti non siamo una forza che pu far da sola precisa ma attenzione siamo una forza che pu sparigliare molto i giochi in casa altrui
5076706 perch non scomparso il nesso tra questione sociale e questione democratica il sistema politico italiano dei grandi partiti ha tentato di separare queste due questioni e sono venute fuori figure politiche zoppe
5076707 spero che dopo lannuncio un passo avanti lo facciano un incontro prima del voto avrebbe notevoli effetti mediatici e potrebbe influenzare chi tra gli elettori di sinistra indeciso ed orientato al non voto
5076708 auspicabile potrebbe influenzare spingere al voto quanti tra gli elettori di sinistra sono indecisi o orientati al non voto perch o non trovano una proposta di sinistra o un soggetto socialista

5076711 for me to walk from leeds to london is probably the single most difficult thing i could ever have imagined
5076712 i still cant quite believe that i have achieved it but i never gave up because of the people that never gave up on me

5076718 i am just so happy to put jamaica on the map no one expected me to win so there was no pressure
5076719 were all great athletes and im very excited about the tremendous achievement were very good athletes and this says a lot for our country
5076720 it will be all right it was just one of those days
5076721 we have been waiting for this a long time and so many jamaican athletes have come so close the guys should have done it too they had the speed
5076722 its wonderful to have a top three for jamaica its stunning
5076723 this victory boosts my confidence to win the 200 we will also do well in the 4x100 i believe we can beat the americans
5076724 it was incredibly close i tried my best gave my all im not frustrated at all
5076725 i wasnt thinking about jamaican speed ive seen them all year long they are very consistent 10 78 into a pretty strong headwind is pretty impressive
5076726 i had to go but i was off step that threw me off a lot im pretty sure it was a false start
5076727 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
5076728 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
5076729 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
5076730 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
5076731 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
5076732 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
5076733 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england

5076793 the only way to get the water out of the valley next to the highway is through pumps and hoses going across the road and every time a car passes over it stops the flow
5076794 its just a matter of getting it cleared out so the rain thats coming throughout this evening and overnight can flow freely and not cause any further trouble
5076795 if we can get those opened up itll greatly diminish the amount of water up there

5076820 the cardinal said that the bill was unacceptable it was an affront to humanity of everybody and especially to the integrity of the human being
5076821 cardinal njue said that a country is going mad if it starts killing its youth because in children the country has the seed for its future
5076822 he said that if any government including president kibakis government were to enact such a law they would be acting against the people of kenya
5076823 he saw no reason now or in the future why anyone would want to legalize abortion in kenya
5076824 does the fact that there is a risk of about 9 to 1 or even of about 49 to 1 of failure with every suicide attempt have some impact on the consideration of this human right i think it does
5076825 the courts have recognized that in ballot arguments proponents are allowed to engage in hyperbole
5076826 sarah was only 15 when she had a secret abortion had someone in her family known about the abortion sarahs life could have been saved
5076827 had someone in her family known sarahs life could have been saved
5076828 however she was still 15 and was not equipped to make medical decisions on her own whether she was living with the father of her child or not
5076829 we will modify the way we present sarah to be accurate with the information
5076830 but we dont think the use of her story is marred
5076831 i cant think of anyone to share this with so i really hope you can give me your thoughts and maybe help my scrambled brain to clarity my 21 year old daughter has just told me she is pregnant
5076832 doesnt believe in terminating pregnancies and wants to keep her baby
5076833 no loving mother could just let two young people make such a grave life changing decision unadvised
5076834 were she to choose the option of abortion you would be able to help her find the best of nhs help with counseling afterwards
5076835 in 1968 a close friend found she was pregnant at 21 by a guy who didnt want to know her parents rejected her
5076836 i would respect any young womans choice of an early termination taken after very deep thought about the meaning of that decision
5076837 my ex forced me into a termination and i feel so guilty
5076838 im 16 and he is 17 we were together for two months we started to have sex about a month into our relationship we didnt use protection because i was a virgin and thought i wouldnt get pregnant
5076839 he told me to get rid of it he didnt want to know
5076840 i had a termination and im so upset about it how can he deny his own child
5076841 i feel used and abused but i still love him and wish i could get him back
5076842 you were foolish and naive but he has behaved appallingly
5076843 please take a good look at the way he has treated you and allow yourself to get very angry with him
5076844 of course though its normal to have mixed feelings after an abortion and my leaflet termination you regret explains more
5076845 planned parenthood wants to move and enlarge their headquarters and abortion center from an area in southeast portland with a black population of about 1 and place it in the king neighborhood that has a black population of about 43
5076846 portland only has an overall population of about 6 blacks planned parenthood will reduce this number even more with their new facility
5076847 portland development commission the urban renewal agency for the area owns the land and wants to use it to kill babies
5076848 we do not want the city of portland to work with planned parenthood and sell urban renewal land to build a prenatal killing center
5076849 the pdc is supposed to assist local and minority owned businesses for the long term sustainable growth of portland instead pdc is using taxpayer resources to help planned parenthood an international multi million dollar organization
5076850 if they would bring a clinic that does abortions that would be a big issue in our community

5076886 jesus was reputed to associate with the unpopular people the sinners and the outcasts of his time
5076887 its a powerful way to demonstrate what we believe in as far as gods grace and forgiveness for sin
5076888 theres an interesting parallel between that imitation of jesus and what we do as criminal defense lawyers because were typically encountering people who have done bad things or are alleged to have done bad things and are at a pretty low ebb in their lives

5077189 and he always brought back a little piece of a place that he explored when he designed this house part of his intention was to have lovely display space
5077190 the water on the north side is shallow and perfect for kayaks

5077203 the us media which obviously still has the cold war macros cranked out stuff about the awful russians
5077204 often i find myself in a minority politically incorrect corner in my explanations of who really did what to whom but in the case of russias incursion into georgia i find myself in the unaccustomed position of taking the majority view so much so that a couple of russian experts have asked me why i dont show my usual independence indeed a standard leftwing commentator on the above mentioned bbc has been publicly scratching his head about how any foreign power could be losing a propaganda battle with the bush administration
5077205 companies such as the state run gazprom which owns strategic pipelines throughout the region and russian mobile telephone operators control infrastructure that has allowed russia to quickly build up a new commercial hegemony ukraine and the baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania were the only former soviet republics to side with georgia this week as saakashvilis actions handed putin an easy propaganda victory most western governments and commentators rushed to accuse russia of blatant aggression in sending its troops into georgias territory but moscow has had little trouble presenting these charges as a case of biased hypocrisy
5077206 russians were told over breakfast yesterday what really happened in georgia the conflict in south ossetia was part of a plot by dick cheney the vice president to stop barack obama being elected president of the united states the line came on the main news of vesti fm a state radio station that like the government and much of russias media has reverted to the old habits of soviet years in which a sinister american hand was held to lie behind every conflict especially those embarrassing to moscow modern russia may be plugged into the internet and the global marketplace but in the battle for world opinion the kremlin is replaying the old black and white movie
5077207 why should abkhazian and s ossetians be forced to live under georgian rule if they dont want to the world has looked favorable on granting independence to other ethnic enclaves why should these two be any different
5077208 as bad as the bloodying of georgia is the broader consequences are worse the united states fiddled while georgia burned not even reaching the right rhetorical level in its public statements until three days after the russian invasion began and not at least to date matching its rhetoric with anything even approximating decisive action

5077321 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5077322 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5077323 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5077324 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5077325 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5077326 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5077327 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5077328 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5077329 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5077334 i will have fun with this when i play with my nephews
5077335 look i dont really know what to say other than hey our bad
5077336 seriously dude it just totally wasnt like us to lash out like that weve been having a couple of bad decades and i guess we just sort of snapped
5077337 russia said south ossetia invited them to try out some of their pipeline stash
5077338 i know russia used to have something going on with georgia but nobody thought it was going to turn into a big ugly scene
5077339 everyone was just sort of staring at russia whos in the middle of beating the hell out of georgia and russias like what
5077340 so russias going around looking for high fives and is like dont leave me hangin bro but the g8 gives him the total gas face so hes like whatever dude this party sucked anyway
5077341 so like russias like come on man you know that wasnt me it was the vodka but the whole security council is like talk to the hand russia and then russias like ummm maybe i should just go hoo kay russia whatever
5077342 look i realize we messed up with this georgia thing
5077343 we just want to make it good and get this thing behind us because anybody who knows us knows that we are all about friendship and keeping our good reputation
5077344 its a shame because russia is a such a great guy when hes not drinking and invading neighbors
5077345 i think it might help if some of us got together and organized an intervention
5077346 but no shit iowahawk might get up tomorrow get baked grab his beautiful wife and ride his moped backwards to a hells angel rally then drink himself into oblivion and fight about 7 crank dealers from the racine chapter of the death jokers all by himself then maybe hed go home romance the beautiful wife build a perfect retro treehouse for his perfect kids drink a bottle of tequila prepare a 3 course meal while beating away a push in home invader and sacrificing him on a makeshift though historically accurate inca altar he built in the woods behind the railroad tracks then hed sit down and knock out a tremedously insulting leftist parody that pissed off thread after thread of kos and du lunatics romance the bride once again and fall asleep chuckling its like hes paul bunyan and mark twain rolled up into one hipster
5077347 i dont like you i love you in a gay way
5077348 i take my hat off this belongs to a very select group of jokes i wish id thought of first
5077349 bloody magnificent is there a nobel prize for comedy if not we damn well need one
5077350 the excellent weblog iowahawk summarized some of the thoughts i had i must also laud david burge of iowahawk for his gritty pragmatism he is no armchair crusader full of empty imprecations
5077351 if iowahawk ever decides to turn his guns on you accept your beating with good grace and a rueful chuckle if you try to fight back it only gets funnier
5077352 next time iowahawk beats up on you just take it if you try to fight back it only gets worse its like one of those monsters that the harder you fight it the stronger it gets because it actually feeds on your pathetic swats
5077353 most bloggers would lose a bar room brawl there are exceptions
5077354 the new mccarthyism f ing pr now go cry to momma
5077355 the master of disaster where else on the web can you channel surf the spirits of mark twain and big daddy roth on the same page
5077356 id say iowahawk was a genius but geniuses arent generally very clever plus studies have shown that nine out of ten have no idea how to clean a carb so statistically speaking his geniushood is unlikely
5077357 iowahawks the kind of guy youd want to run into in balagan
5077358 le blog am ricain iowahawk qui traite lactualit par la d rision a transpos les v nements du moyen orient dans le midwest am ricain en jouant sur le fait que mideast veut dire moyen orient

5077387 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5077402 its important when something like this happens that people of all faiths
5077403 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5077404 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5077405 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5077406 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5077407 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5077408 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5077409 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5077410 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5077411 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5077412 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5077413 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5077414 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5077415 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5077416 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5077417 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5077418 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5077419 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5077420 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5077421 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5077422 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5077423 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5077424 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5077425 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5077426 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5077427 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5077428 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5077429 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5077430 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5077431 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5077432 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5077433 this is some of the best agricultural land in quebec the soil is excellent in this area
5077434 also its really important to understand that the farmers who are being displaced have been working this land for generations now in some cases for hundreds of years their land is precious to them
5077435 citizens from the entire area impacted by the highway expansion project are also opposing the development residents from saint constant delson and sainte catherine are

5077437 we all like astonishing tales because they touch the nerve of the ancient instinct of astonishment
5077438 this proves that even nursery tales only echo an almost pre natal leap of interest and amazement these tales say that apples were golden only to refresh the forgotten moment when we found that they were green they make rivers run with wine only to make us remember for one wild moment that they run with water
5077439 fairy tales are more than true not because they tell us the dragons exist but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten
5077440 these tales say that apples were golden only to refresh the forgotten moment when we found that they were green
5077441 life is no paragraph and death i think is no parenthesis

5077461 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5077462 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5077463 why why is this happening to me i shouldnt have been born not like this not in this world maybe someone else deserved my body more than i did and i took it away
5077464 but sonny havent you left any trace of hope inside of ya is it all that bad for ya whats the matter trouble with your mummy your daddy beat you up last night didnt he
5077465 no mister hope as you call it is for the blind ones why because men with many senses do not perceive the subtleties other can enjoy sometimes it is very hard to lie in all that darkness being unfair to paint it with white roses you know hope has many many voices it is a symphony of life and every time the band starts playing the loudest voice is the one from an instrument named regret
5077466 but tell me young man why is it that people tend to grow the white roses you speak about in their inner gardens
5077467 you see sir it is not the black roses that are most poisonous it is the innocent white ones they are terribly embalmed in the sweetest poison they can consume you while youre only admiring their thorns they inject poison trough light i cant give you any details but thats what i see i am maybe the only one that is both deaf and unable to see although my eyes are never shut
5077468 you know mister i dont know why people chase the sparks of their own burning dreams instead of limiting themselves to just warming their souls near those fires they just seem to forget that dreams wont last forever nor will those flames so why build cities out of sparks when they are just so hard to tame when it is all just a mirage dazzling the eyes of puny minds
5077469 well young man your noire qualification of life is making me reflect on what was hope when i was your age i just sat their and enjoyed the presents santa gave me now well its a little different as you know santa doesnt exist or maybe he is just like us a being out of nothing cursed with the spell of self consciousness thats the mystery of life for ya take it from one who knows
5077470 im sorry just forget what i just said i come from a world full of crap where adults think that they have seen everything a man is capable of only because their bodies develop you are looking like a very sick person to me but alas your thoughts hesitate not in surprising me they are like a vine of intellectual matter that is reaching for some solitary trees just be careful as you pointed out vaguely not many will understand you needless to remind that none will help you for that matter although i pretend to understand a little of your passions i cant help i cant even give you money for you see i am a poor bastard that can barely pay a rent in this godforsaken country
5077471 money wont buy you happiness unless they come in huge quantities

5077478 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5077501 sinhalese and tamil alike have found that scientologists are good people our respect for other religions especially buddhism and people of faith is genuine and evidenced by our actions
5077502 unfortunately asia is still divided according to the lines of religions languages and according to so many other idiotic factors
5077503 it appears therefore that one of the foremost problems confronting humanity today is how to make the transition from the precarious state that we are now in based on the use of fossil fuels to this optimum future state based on the use of renewable energy sources by a least catastrophic progression our principal impediments at present are neither lack of energy or material resources nor of essential physical and biological knowledge our principal constraints are cultural during the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential growth culture a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of nongrowth

5077530 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5077531 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5077532 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5077533 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5077534 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5077535 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5077536 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5077537 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5077538 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
5077539 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play
5077540 but god being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us even when we were dead in our transgressions made us alive together with christ
5077541 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5077542 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5077543 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5077544 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5077545 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5077546 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5077547 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5077548 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5077549 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5077550 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5077551 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5077552 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5077553 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5077554 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5077555 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5077556 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5077557 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5077558 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5077559 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5077560 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5077561 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5077562 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5077563 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5077564 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

5077572 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5077573 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5077574 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on the 29th of march 2008
5077575 it wont last unless its a common product that is owned by this entire collective of the leadership of zimbabwe
5077576 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide

5077602 i was starting to get nervous there he was just fouling it off fouling it off and all of a sudden i had three balls on him
5077603 i have dreamed of being a hero of one of the games maybe winning the world series eventually but not such a great game all along
5077604 i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5077605 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5077606 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5077607 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5077608 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5077609 obviously ive been the no 1 european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5077610 its such a high in my career it very easily could be the last high and many players have failed at this point in the past
5077611 playing with all these great golfers out here and competing with those great golfers i think is going to make me develop my game and give me lots of confidence when i get ready for the u
5077612 i think its a good opportunity to play in this
5077613 i didnt even think about playing this well he added
5077614 all i was trying to do was not make any mistakes

5077637 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5077638 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5077639 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5077656 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year bowden said

5077689 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5077690 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5077691 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5077692 the iranian media is mistaken it was the launch of a rocket capable of carrying a satellite the omid satellite was not launched itself
5077693 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5077694 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5077695 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5077696 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5077697 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5077698 there are ups and downs with a slight advantage to obama
5077699 if anybody had asked us a couple of months ago whether or not we would like to be where we are today which from what we can tell is a pretty even race we would have been pretty thrilled

5077706 it is clearly a competitive state this year and we can win here
5077707 i dont think theyre counting on it i dont think theyre expecting it i think what in part is happening is that they are forcing mccain to spend time and resources in states where he otherwise wasnt expecting to do so
5077708 theres a growing partisan self identification balance thats helping democrats
5077709 fewer people are calling themselves republicans even in the south
5077710 theres no doubting that this is a tough environment for republicans
5077711 just by virtue of having an r next to your name youre going to have to run a very serious campaign to win
5077712 you typically have coattails where as a new president takes over members of his party tend to be advantaged at the congressional level and then trickling down to state races as well
5077713 katrina has influenced my artwork exponentially its basically my jumping off point
5077714 it is something i knew id have to deal with in rebuilding my life
5077715 he told me if i could put anything together theyd look at it
5077716 it was great to be making art again but i didnt know where i wanted to go with it i wanted to do something pertaining to katrina but i was so angry
5077717 when i came to iowa state i wanted to make work that would help me cope with the aftermath of hurricane katrina i was looking for closure from what i had just been through the emotional and psychological toll that my mind and body endured after katrina left me questioning everything i had ever learned the world seemed to be flipped on its axis and i felt as though i was free falling out of control the ease at which everything i owned was destroyed left me sick to my stomach at times the total lack of respect for human life at the hands of the united states government during hurricane katrina is something i will never forget
5077718 it has the appearance of function but it doesnt actually work thats my critique of the government after katrina
5077719 the dome represents the superdome and its legs are modeled after crawfish the factory denotes new orleans shipping yard the back hoe is the destruction and recovery of the city and the water tower sits on an oil rig structure representing the special interests

5077745 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5077746 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5077747 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5077748 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5077749 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5077750 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5077751 it looked like he could have gone 9 54 seemingly
5077752 maybe he could have gone 0 60 low or some say 59 its amazing
5077753 its going to be interesting im waiting just as much as you to see
5077754 im not worried about world records i have a lot more time to think about that right now my main aim is just to win
5077755 i think bolts definitely capable of running 19 5 considering the rounds
5077756 four rounds of the 100 im pretty sure his legs are pretty tired
5077757 but if he runs 9 something on curve hes a strong guy tall it looks like he would be capable of breaking the record if its the right conditions
5077758 ive already kissed it goodbye if he keeps running like this

5077786 china maybe leading in the number of gold metals for now
5077787 still we feel we stand a fair chance at stealing the lead in the number of gold metals from them as well after all we still got our new speedo stealth swimsuit technology besides i just got word from the state department that the entire olympic team from australia just defected to our side i mean that they were just sworn in as citizens of the united states of america bringing their olympic metals over with them so we are way ahead in the lead now

5077866 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

5077903 tenevamo molto a questa coppa siamo dispiaciuti di non essere riusciti ad andare avanti dovevamo essere pi compatti in fase di non possesso palla e soprattutto non siamo stati capaci di concretizzare le occasioni che abbiamo creato nella ripresa con la necessit di recuperare il risultato la squadra ha avuto una carica diversa e un atteggiamento in campo pi aggressivo ma se vogliamo vincere qualche partita dobbiamo imparare a segnare lassenza dei centravanti a questo riguardo vorrei fare una precisazione la societ conosce le necessit di questa squadra e sa cosa si aspetta lallenatore e poi non ho mai detto che serva solo una punta
5077904 non volevo fallire in modo cos clamoroso le occasioni che ho avuto ma nel calcio ci pu stare non andata bene e mi dispiace molto colpa mia sotto porta devo essere pi concreto per gli errori che ho commesso sotto porta mi darei un 5 per parlando di prestazione penso di avere giocato bene anche perch per la prima volta dopo 9 mesi ho fatto tutti i novanta minuti s fisicamente sto bene landamento della gara nel primo tempo eravamo tesi contratti non abbiamo creato molto ma non abbiamo neppure corso grandi rischi e questo positivo nella seconda parte della partita abbiamo creato parecchio ma non siamo riusciti a capitalizzare le nostre occasioni da gol che dire meglio sbagliare adesso che in campionato
5077905 abbiamo avuto troppe difficolt contro un avversario di caratura inferiore bene solo la vittoria che ci regala la possibilit di affrontare una squadra di a come il torino e di giocare una gara prima dellinizio della stagione per il resto c molto da migliorare a partire dalla condizione fisica
5077906 e stata una bella vittoria contro una squadra ben attrezzata soffrire a inizio stagione ci st
5077907 sono molto contento per i miei gol ma soprattutto perch questi gol ci danno la possibilit di affrontare una squadra come il torino la partita stata combattuta ma alla fine c labbiamo fatta ora il nostro pensiero solo rivolto al fascino della gara allolimpico
5077908 meritavamo qualcosa di pi la sconfitta ci sta un p stretta per quello visto in campo prendiamo atto che usciamo da questa competizione a testa alta con la consapevoleza che siamo sulla strada giusta e stata una bella gara e dopo il pareggio ci credevo di risucire a fare lo sgambetto al brescia i ragazzi sono stati bravi c lhanno messa tutta complimenti comunque a loro

5077929 you stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you always resist the holy spirit as your fathers did so do you which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute and they killed those who foretold the coming of the just one of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers who have received the law by the direction of angels and have not kept it
5077930 look i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god
5077931 it is close to home and they are going to have a lot of family and friends and i know they are really looking forward to it
5077932 they are so sloped and undulated that even the smallest miscue can be disastrous you can miss your target by a couple feet and end up coming down thirty feet away from the pin it is just a matter of staying patient out there because it is one of the hardest courses around
5077933 i dont think it is a very big deal i think the better player is going to win the match just like the better score is going to win in stroke play it should not mean much i think you can definitely make a bigger deal out of it than it is
5077934 i havent seen some of those guys all summer so it will be fun to play with them again
5077935 i think out of the four of us from the team all of us have a legit chance to go all the way i would not be surprised at all to see one or two of us make it pretty far
5077936 i couldnt play at all on the course last year until the very end of the school year
5077937 i did not really have any expectations for the summer other than getting back into playing to be able to play real well all summer was probably a surprise and a bonus i feel pretty good about it
5077938 clearly brain cells have evolved to reconnect under almost any circumstance that doesnt kill them
5077939 i think the bursting is a function of sensory deprivation
5077940 with no structured sensory input the hypothesis is that you get arbitrarily random and quite often detrimental activity because all these cells are asking for some kind of direction
5077941 it seems that sensory input is setting the background level of activity inside the brain
5077942 its like training an animal to do something by gradual increments
5077943 this system is a model everything it does is merely similar to what goes on in a brain its not really the same thing we can learn about the brain but it may mislead us

5077947 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5077948 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5077949 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5077950 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5077991 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5077992 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5077993 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5077994 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet

5077996 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5077997 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5077998 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5077999 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5078000 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5078001 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5078002 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5078003 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5078004 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5078005 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5078006 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5078007 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5078008 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5078009 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5078010 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5078011 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5078012 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that

5078017 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
5078018 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
5078019 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
5078020 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
5078021 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
5078022 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
5078023 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
5078024 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
5078025 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
5078026 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves
5078027 we havent identified specific occupations yet thats what were consulting with all of these stakeholders about

5078029 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5078030 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

5078035 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like i have taught her we have both changed and grown and we just feel like oh okay this is completion
5078036 i was anticipating a very hard battle if i did catch him so when i saw the red bike slide out i could hardly believe it this made things a lot easier for me
5078037 we are 50 points clear which is a lot however we know that 50 points is still not always enough when you have someone as strong as casey and so we wont relax
5078038 that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it it was my mistake we knew that we needed to win this race and more in order to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us
5078039 i was confident today because my bike was fast from friday practice and with chief mechanic jeremy burgess we made a small modification to the front after warm up to allow me to be a bit faster in some sections and it worked very well i lost about half a second getting past hopkins at the start and casey was incredibly fast at that stage like hed already done 10 laps for a short time i was worried but then after two laps i understood that my bike was working very well and that i was fast enough to try to catch him i had closed a little bit already and gradually the red bike was becoming a bit bigger in front of me and i think this is when he started to push harder and made his mistake i was anticipating a very hard battle if i did catch him so when i saw the red bike slide out i could hardly believe it this made things a lot easier for me after that i just enjoyed riding my bike my bridgestone tires worked very well until the end and my m1 felt very good of course i cant count this as a complete victory because casey fell and i am sorry for him but this is racing and i have to be happy with this result we are 50 points clear which is a lot and i am very excited to be going to misano in this situation however we know that 50 points is still not always enough when you have someone as strong as casey and so we wont relax now we have two days of testing and we will try some new electronics in order to help me open the throttle earlier and also of course test some bridgestone tires
5078040 i am very happy by my performance since germany we have improved a lot also thanks to the new technical material received by ducati i also thought i could have done a podium in laguna seca but i committed a mistake and i couldnt make it today everything went in the right direction i am sure that we can maintain the same level for the rest of the season i heard rumors that wanted me in superbike next season i never spoke to anybody in superbike and i want to remain in motogp for many more years i am happy to work in the alice team and with the pramac racing structure if things will go well in this final part of the season i dont see why i should change team
5078041 i want to say what a fantastic day this is for me today after the injury in barcelona i have not had the opportunity to go quick due to my condition but all the people around me including the whole team and suzuki stayed really close to me and gave me great support so i am really happy to pay them back with this podium it actually feels more like a win for me because it means so much after the break following laguna i was able to get some rest and start training again to get myself back in the best condition and although i am still not 100 percent i am nearly there and i was able to challenge all weekend my dream this weekend was to fight for a podium after friday i felt i could do that and today i started with a good focus to do my best this result is for all the team and everybody working with me because when we make a great result i am really happy and today i am certainly really happy
5078042 its obviously disappointing to finish the race in 11 th place especially after feeling so confident and strong early on we took a gamble with our tire choice today and used a rear tire that nobody else had in their selection i got a great start to the race and i sat behind the suzuki riders while they battled things out for third unfortunately the tire began to drop off and at the end of the race the left side just didnt have any grip usually i can ride around a problem like this but with the knee injury im carrying i couldnt prop the bike up to compensate for this lack of traction the positive thing is that we were strong while the tire was working well and we achieved a front row start so we have a goal to aim for in testing over the next few days during the next two days of testing im looking forward to catching up on a lot of the riding ive missed through injury improving the bike further and finding a solution to the problem we had today id also like to congratulate anthony west its great to see him riding like that again and he really deserved the result he achieved
5078043 i could see straightaway behind james that he was having some issues with the front tire which we expected i still thought i could put a good pace together but it never happened i just didnt have the confidence i needed to push harder with the tires and the more i pushed i didnt seem to go much faster james was able to leave me pretty easily as my issues started to get worse but i wanted to stay out there and try my best for my guys at tech 3 and yamaha who as always have been working like crazy to help me this weekend i thank them for that but there was nothing else i could do toward the end i just decided to take a few more risks and i went a bit quicker but there was no way i was going to catch anybody ive had a bad run lately but im still in contention for fourth in the championship and ill keep fighting but we need big improvements from michelin the good start we had to the season seems like a long way away now and we have to work with michelin to try and solve some of the issues because i didnt enjoy today at all

5078077 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5078078 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5078079 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship she once said samanthas the father i never had apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5078080 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5078081 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her

5078083 i think its a beautiful thing that 13 years later shes even more powerful as far as her name and her music just carrying on and that i think is a beautiful thing a lot of children come here to the museum that werent even born when selena was alive and they speak of her as if they know her and that comes from their parents in a weird kind of way its a little southing to my soul to know that she is not going to be forgotten as a person and also as an artist

5078087 the reason we did the merrill and citi deals were that we got exposure but we used our size to get better terms than you could get in the public markets and with a lower risk profile than youd get in public market
5078088 basically we are flat on a 300 million investment where the stock has gone down 50 percent
5078089 we looked at their asset management business and we thought there was a lot of value there the market wasnt pricing in
5078090 what we learned from the merrill and citi deals is when youre part of a group that has a lot of capital you can drive much better deals than when you get picked off one at time
5078091 the concept could apply to a bunch of other asset classes as well its early every state has its own issues its own culture its not easy

5078099 how many observations should i make of each object it is most efficient to make two or three observations over a period of an hour or so per object per night observations of specific objects are best made on pairs of nearby nights as the accuracy of isolated single night observations can be difficult to judge by observing on pairs of nights any ambiguity is removed you should not make only one observation of each object per night neither should you make many more than three observations per objects per night it is a waste of your time and rarely helps the orbit solution however to make observations of a new discovery in groups many hours apart on a single night can be useful particularly in the case of an newly discovered object that may be close to the earth for multi opposition objects the preferable regimen of observing is observations on pairs on night in each dark run around each opposition until the object is numbered

5078260 a honolulu policeman would not help her because the federal property is not his jurisdiction
5078261 a palace spokesman said a police officer who was there drove away after refusing to help
5078262 that was our plan this morning to come to the palace check things out this is the only palace in the us but here we are standing on the outside looking in the gate it was disappointing
5078263 we came to the property unlocked the gates and arrested in excess of 20 people
5078264 we are going to close the palace grounds and the palace through the weekend we need to look through the property and building to determine if anything was damaged
5078265 she said we hit her we dont hit nobody we are not violence people
5078266 outraged that a native hawaiian group would choose this type of behavior in the presence of an historic treasured landmark such as iolani palace i personally witnessed one of our staff members being physically assaulted by a member of the kingdom of hawaii nation a police officer standing by did nothing to help her saying that it was not his jurisdiction at one point during the evening the alarms went off in the barracks building and our security staff called 911 they were told it was not 911s jurisdiction and to call the state this extraordinary landmark and the people who care for it deserve every protection the state and our local police force can muster
5078267 hpds position has always been to provide full support for any law enforcement agency that requests it the individuals who were arrested had clearly violated the law in this instance our assistance was requested by the department of public safety which was assisting the department of land and natural resources the agency that is responsible for security of iolani palace as a result of the request i authorized that all necessary resources be provided the actions taken by our officers last night were appropriate although no formal complaint has been made i am aware of the allegations regarding our initial response and have directed that an internal review be conducted
5078268 as a matter of historical record we wish to point out that the original seat of government of the hawaiian kingdom was not iolani palace the palace was the royal residence government activities were carried out in the original courthouse now demolished then later in aliiolani hale

5078274 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5078275 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5078276 i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not

5078282 the sacramento utilities department does not know where the meters are they were labeled unaccounted for in a recent city investigation the city auditor estimates the missing meters are worth about 1 3 million
5078283 they could be lost or in a city building where no one thought to look
5078284 best case the city failed to record their location and theyre plumbed into the city water system in front of 4 492 homes and businesses worst case the meters solid bronze and weighing at least 8 pounds each were stolen and sold perhaps as scrap metal the sacramento police department is conducting a criminal investigation and the fbi is probing improper sales of salvage metals from utilities department storage yards theres only one sure solution to the meter mystery go out count them all

5078302 but if a computer cant read such a captcha how does the system know the correct answer to the puzzle heres how each new word that cannot be read correctly by ocr is given to a user in conjunction with another word for which the answer is already known the user is then asked to read both words if they solve the one for which the answer is known the system assumes their answer is correct for the new one the system then gives the new image to a number of other people to determine with higher confidence whether the original answer was correct

5078320 goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine
5078321 i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it
5078322 i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
5078323 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
5078324 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
5078325 the fairness doctrine if applied on the internet would violate network neutrality principles
5078326 the network has never cared about the political positions of the senders of packets and it would violate the neutral behavior of the network if it had to start caring
5078327 perhaps more useful than the fairness doctrine would be a law requiring that fcc commissioners be technologists and visionaries instead of partisan lobbyists
5078328 americans of all political stripes are tired of politicians saying the grass is blue and the sky is green

5078334 the fcc found cause in only 28 of these cases to even ask the broadcaster to respond to the complaint
5078335 only six cases were decided against the stations and admonitions were issued
5078336 if it werent for the fairness doctrine we couldnt even have gotten that measly five percent
5078337 it is hard to imagine that the american people would support reinstating a policy where the federal government would be required to police the airwaves to ensure differing viewpoints are offered
5078338 i know most of my fellow conservative bloggers hate mccain
5078339 but anyone with 22 pets and whos against the fairness doctrine cant be all that bad
5078340 the key principle here is not shutting down one perspective or another
5078341 it is making sure that communities are informed about a range of local and national public affairs

5078349 so it was great because it took us out of the mix
5078350 these bosses are the guys that do this for 40 years with pride in their work and if you ask any of them none of them will say that strength is the most important thing to succeed in their job its heart

5078396 the lady helen jacobs who helped me the most died in the middle of the project she knew the history and could help me with the papers which were often hard to read it was hard when she died we had just become friends i used to call her and visit and talk i eventually became friends with her daughter who also knew the history and was able to help me finish

5078442 benchmarking ebb thin mongrel and fastcgi for ruby on rails hosting
5078443 the new and improved ruby servers such as thin and ebb are very fast and efficient when handling new requests and their connections but are probably a bit slower in handling the actual ruby code
5078444 do you think this old guy is off his rocker going senile perhaps no im oke
5078445 isnt that a bit daft and couldnt you do that in the day time
5078446 no those worms only come out at night i am watching them mate
5078447 yes you see one earth worm can have as many as 200 offspring and i like to have as many worms as we possibly can get we had to excavate here so that we could have a walkout basement into the backyard and at present there is not much topsoil those worms will help to restore the soil in a of couple years i want to have some good garden soil here come and watch them mate see how they lie head to tail as they cling together
5078448 earthworms are prodigious diggers and earth movers capable of burrowing down as deep as fifteen feet they can squeeze between and push apart the soil crumbs and one worm alone can move a stone fifty times its own weight as they burrow earthworms mix and sift the soils breaking up clods and burying stones some carry down leaves and other organic matter others bring nutrients and humus to the top tunnels held together by their mucus afford planted roots quicker avenues into the soil and the mucus forming humus prevents erosion henry hope says these materials once dried do not dissolve again in water yet while the soil thus treated holds the required moisture the burrows drain superfluous water experiments have shown that soils with earthworms drain from four to ten times faster than those without conversely in light sandy soils where water tends to run straight through to the subsoil the aggregates produced by earthworm castings act to improve the retention of water
5078449 whats more the castings are always more acidic ally neutral than the soil from which they were formed naturally improving the local ph factor as armies of earthworms work to keep the soil in balance neither too acid nor too alkaline
5078450 at the michael j fox foundation we believe that our capital has an obligation to fund high risk high reward projects that if successful could significantly improve the lives of people with parkinsons
5078451 a major element of our work is the identification and prioritization of approaches like armagens efforts that without our backing would likely stall for lack of resources
5078452 trojan horse technology has intrigued parkinsons researchers for years because of its theoretical potential to overcome the drug delivery hurdle one of the single most significant challenges facing the entire field
5078453 it is fitting that the michael j fox foundation which is searching urgently for treatments that will significantly modify parkinsons disease should provide funding to vet the potential of this technology to yield new therapies that could transform patients lives

5078465 he has a good right foot a good left foot and hes pacy hell give barry ferguson and kevin thomson a good push
5078466 he won rookie of the year in the us last year i was asked by assistant manager ally mccoist if there were any americans i could recommend
5078467 once upon a time test match special was part of a great tradition of bbc radio
5078468 but they are bringing in commentators with little knowledge of the game especially of the cadences of test match cricket
5078469 they must sit there with reference books on their laps they just dont know enough about the game
5078470 some of the one day internationals have been perfectly dreadful very much b team
5078471 they are coming from the shop floor of the sports room we need two or three really top flight commentators tat is all that test match special needs to get by they have got to be the best
5078472 ive noticed with a slightly wry smile that the new commentators tend to make cross references with football which you cant imagine happening in the past i know how much agnew hates football
5078473 there was a move amongst the management to make it sound like radio five but thats one of the things that people like about it it doesnt sound like radio five
5078474 no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5078475 but there are 37 games left so its not a disaster we have shown we can come from behind before in title campaigns
5078476 more goals please an ironic comment on last seasons prolific form but the message acquired a different meaning following these 90 frustrating minutes darren fletcher cancelled out obafemi martins goal but the hosts then failed to break down the resolute visitors
5078477 but i was really pleased with the attitude it was spot on i said to the players if we can come here and do that we can go anywhere
5078478 rooney will be much sharper next week against portsmouth and tevez will be back said ferguson who refused to discuss berbatov
5078479 im not angry about the decision of juande ramos to name me as a substitute said berbatov
5078480 im not crying i only show my emotions to my close friends and family its not a hard period for me i still have friends in tottenham
5078481 i think this will be the most important week said dantchev
5078482 i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov
5078483 i cant wait to call him to hear who the wow signing is mused keegan
5078484 its a shame he told the corporate fans before me
5078485 dennis wise mike ashley and tony jimenez know we need three more players we are working really well to get some quality signings in over the past few years newcastle have got some players in who havent been good enough for whatever reason
5078486 if dennis gets me three more like that keegan laughed slightly uneasily although he rightly enthused about all three new boys
5078487 gutierrez was terrific said keegan of the left winger who brought a pacy threat and preparedness to track back
5078488 coloccini has had one training session yet he showed his class i had young danny guthrie as my man of the match he could prove to be as good as the other two who are both internationals
5078489 ive told steven he can learn from fabricio said keegan
5078490 i told him if he learns he can take the step up steven is in the under 21s now and can step up again to where fabricio is a full international they could be our partnership for the next five years

5078493 it was because she was fat thats why the dive was so bad
5078494 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5078495 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5078496 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5078497 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5078498 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5078499 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5078500 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5078501 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5078502 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5078503 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5078504 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5078505 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5078506 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5078507 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5078508 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5078509 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5078510 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5078511 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5078512 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5078513 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5078514 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5078515 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5078516 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5078517 one has to wonder your focus if it took you so long
5078518 detectives investigating the fatal stabbing of conor black in harpurhey have arrested a 16 year old boy on suspicion of murder
5078519 anyone with any information about conors murder is asked to call police on 0161 856 3540 or crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111
5078520 a number of individuals were detained and questioned this week as a result of a proactive police operation consequently some have been charged with drug related offences unconnected to the mullanys murder
5078521 at this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information regarding these individuals so far as the two females arrested and charged last week they are still remanded in custody at her majestys prison again we are not in a position to disclose any details regarding their arrests and charges except to say they are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody

5078530 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5078531 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5078532 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5078533 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5078534 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5078535 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5078536 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5078537 i mean it took an attitude adjustment on my part but as long as im on this team i want to do what i can to help if that means coming off the bench then so be it
5078538 i want to go out there and play every day and see what kind of player i can become
5078539 you know the grass is always greener people say so it ends up being equal like i said my goal is still to start every day someday in the big leagues as long as im with white sox this is my role
5078540 were trying to push the envelope with jeff with the off day monday and hopefully we get through it
5078541 we have to go according to how he feels but hes pretty much in a place right now mentally where hes planning on playing every day and if i happen to tell him the day before or give him a call and tell him lets back off today hes been fine with that but with the off day monday were sort of pushing it today
5078542 this is a huge thing thats why i was kind of nervous
5078543 he would tell me dont tell me what im doing well
5078544 i know that tell me what i need to do to become a good player he said if we do this switch i dont want to be just good at it i want to be really good at it
5078545 i said craig if you want to do that then you have to think about gold gloves and he won four of them
5078546 its offense baserunning everything you see now from second basemen it started with craig he was truly one of the greatest players who ever played this game
5078547 i cant tell you how privileged i am to have had the chance to play with him for the last 15 years youre an amazing player an amazing father an amazing husband anyone with a child sitting next to them you want your child to grow up and be craig biggio
5078548 even if it was by accident like when he accidentally moved his arm out and accidentally got hit by the pitch
5078549 he would chew a piece of gum and when it was time for him to bat he would stick the piece of gum in his helmet and save it for later
5078550 that nasty helmet you saw on the outside had gum stains all on the inside
5078551 bagwell volunteered to come over and drive it and help get the diamond in good shape
5078552 terry deserves it hes been a great brother to me he works hard hes a good man
5078553 thank you for being astros fans thank you for being fans of the game i think the coolest thing about astros fans is they love the logo but they truly love the person that wears it more
5078554 it is troubling that there are so many countries that appear not to record the lives of those animals suffering in their laboratories
5078555 knowing the number of animals used gives real ammunition for the general public to put pressure on their governments to play their part in the global reduction and replacement of animals in experiments
5078556 the paper makes too many assumptions and extrapolations to have any confidence in its conclusion
5078557 they know the media will pick up 115 million as the top line result and not delve deeper into how they achieved this number
5078558 this year is the first time in 16 years that we have seen the number of animals used in uk labs exceed three million

5078586 the countries on russias border are more firmly in our camp now than they were even before the war
5078587 is an independent and sovereign state and an independent and sovereign state can be a member of nato
5078588 one of the goals that the russians had in this very pre planned aggression was to finish off any threat as they see it emanating from georgias members in nato
5078589 if american could do something why didnt they help us

5078819 we have the maximum number of human leopard conflict situations here
5078820 leopards are the only big cats that often go near humans and then become prone to revenge killings villagers are known to poison them
5078821 we have the best sex ratio of elephants in the country to maintain this it is imperative to safeguard them at this time since people often tend to shoot them we plan to capture the elephants and keep them at the rescue centre if they create problems they can later be released

5078823 i insisted the protestors will be thirsty we can offer them water
5078824 we will not stop we have to cross the loc we have to re unite kashmir
5078825 there have been only superficial changes in the situation here kashmir was a problem yesterday and is a problem today
5078826 historically kashmir had been at the centre of cultural and economic interaction it was a meeting point for south asia china tibet and central asia but since 1947 it has been pushed to the periphery
5078827 they had a chance to resolve the problem during musharrafs tenure once you lose the opportunity you have to face the reality in a crude manner they didnt even respond when farooq abdullah proposed autonomy that was passed by the assembly peace in kashmir was an illusion
5078828 i had warned both pm manmohan singh and congress president sonia gandhi that this movement to muzafarabad will take a new dimension and go out of control if not handled urgently
5078829 our weakness in the shape of dependence on a system to guarantee the safety of our economic and lifeline linkages with the rest of the country it made people realise that the peace process has not delivered anything now what we see is the resurfacing of the old anger till now we have blamed pakistan for everything in kashmir this is the first time we have only ourselves to blame
5078830 amarnath land row might be the immediate cause but the level of anger is the result of the long pent up disillusionment with new delhis status quo policies
5078831 new delhi talks to us when the situation is really bad here and when there is apparent peace they ignore us
5078832 the hurriyat joined the dialogue risking its own credibility we lost people but what was the result as soon as new delhi felt there was some peace in valley it abandoned the talks and left us in the lurch
5078833 a disillusionment born of the realisation that all talks on kashmir were held for the sake of them to buy time and to buy interlocutors rather than work out a solution
5078834 the situation is worse than 2002 when we took over there is a lack of understanding of the real issue and we have been trying to make the centre realise this
5078835 while i would say that new delhi underestimated the potency of the sentiment in kashmir it also exhibited an arrogant triumph over the relative peace in recent past but now the reality has blown up on everybodys face and it has torn through the lies piled up over the years that whatever was happening in kashmir was pakistan sponsored
5078836 this place has a real problem and it needs a real solution
5078837 we saw strong revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of our focus on core businesses our operating cash flow increased significantly from the previous quarter although our business was negatively impacted by the earthquake in may business conditions rebounded quickly in june in addition we expanded our network capacity significantly in the second quarter for example the total installed base of digital poster frames exceeded 25 000 units as of june 30 2008 and is well on its way towards our goal of a 50 000 to 60 000 installation base by the year end
5078838 while we continue to see strong advertising demand from consumer goods advertisers in china in particular non olympic sponsor advertisers are increasing their advertising spending in the later half of the year after the olympic games our large scale and highly effective media coverage of high end urban consumers in china differentiates us from competition our outlook for the remainder of 2008 and 2009 is getting stronger
5078839 the authorities took some half a dozen coaches but nobody asked me i talk to my boys daily and am seeing their performances on television the authorities dont think much of me anyways not long ago they had lambasted my methods and told me to understand what the olympics are before preparing boys for it
5078840 there was a lot of pressure on me to change his style but the boy was confident of playing in this manner moreover i had carefully devised this approach after having studied clips of past matches and gleaning information from sports journals i even met three time olympic gold medalist lazio papp of hungry for his inputs so i persisted and as they say nothing succeeds like success
5078841 this land has a sports culture but initially people would pick on sports to bag that reserved seat for sportspersons in government departments especially the police but the success of these three boys has made them look at it as a full time career also the boys are from very modest backgrounds which makes their success all the more creditable
5078842 i played at the state level and jitender would accompany me but then my father developed brain tumour and i had to pick up a job as an accountant this stopped my career but allowed jitender to pursue the sport
5078843 the only way i could supplement my income was by doing overtime which meant travelling on more and more routes

5078846 even after having won medals at the commonwealth and world championships akhil was offered a class iii railway job he was derided after his failure at athens and had decided to hang up his boots it was only his disinclination towards this job that made him work hard overcome an injury and then pick up boxing again
5078847 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5078848 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union

5078850 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response

5078859 we do not want our world to perish but in our quest for knowledge century by century we have placed all our trust in a cold impartial intellect which only brings us nearer to destruction we have heeded no wisdom offering guidance only by learning to love one another can our world be saved only love can conquer all

5078871 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5078872 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5078873 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5078874 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5078875 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5078876 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5078877 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5078878 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5078879 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5078880 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5078881 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5078882 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5078883 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5078884 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5078885 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify

5078887 atom is off to a very very rapid start far exceeding our expectations when we started the year
5078888 its the perfect recession product to have in the marketplace
5078889 well know kind of in six months how much of this demand for atom is real and how much is customers thinking theyre going to win in the market place and double ordering
5078890 it seems to be growing the market rather than cannibalizing existing pc sales

5078898 i think these numbers should provide a bit more assurance to policy makers that wages growth overall remain fairly well under control
5078899 the annual growth over the last year at around 3 75 to four shouldnt really provide any alarm to policy makers
5078900 the fact that they didnt suggests that it is a precautionary cut back in spending rather than a really forced cut back
5078901 if you expect the unemployment rate to rise over the next year then it will take a fair while before that reflected in lower wages growth
5078902 despite its volatility the rba will take some comfort that the growth in this measure has moderated and is now closer to the more reliable wage cost index data released yesterday
5078903 our office is concerned about people incurring large expenses for data downloads
5078904 its been a concern of ours for some time in a sense the iphone is the latest in a series of 3g capable handsets which people are able to download data on and our office has seen many complaints where consumers have incurred unexpectedly high bills as a result of the data they have downloaded
5078905 you can download so much data so quickly at considerable cost if you are not on the right plan
5078906 there is no doubt that people are still getting to grips with that
5078907 people have already got their first pro rata iphone bills and many of them are shocked according to reports on iphone forums particularly those on the lower volume plans

5078911 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5078912 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5078913 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them

5078924 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
5078925 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on
5078926 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light

5078962 the area has been in and out of drought since the start of the decade mostly in
5078963 but fall of last year was when it really started to get bad in some places this year has been as dry or even drier than the dust bowl
5078964 the people around here learned their lessons in the dust bowl and the drought of the 50s
5078965 they know it can get bad and they take care of the land year in and year out so when a drought does hit it helps protect their resources a little more
5078966 nearly everyone in the farming community around here has a conservation plan and tries very hard to follow those plans
5078967 the irrigated crops arent making it because although the farmers have watered and watered the high winds and heat are so excessive the water cant keep up with the evaporation rate

5078984 if the fishermen are opposed to the windmills its because they will keep them from trawling which is illegal he observed
5078985 what has happened there is that artificial islands of life have been created around the windmills pylons
5078986 they are places where one cannot fish and the animals take refuge there
5078987 for example bluefin tuna one of the species fished for in spain is very sensitive to current dynamics which could be changed by the new structures

5079006 it started out just as a flood would the water was coming over the bank then with every succeeding second it came faster and faster then the water just rolled you could see it rolling down the valley a black wall of water
5079007 that flood took 10 to 15 minutes and it was total black sludge water about 130 million gallons of sludge and it just moved houses like matchsticks they were just being moved and cars and we saw trees bend and railroad tracks wrapped around trees

5079040 weet gij niet dat een weinig zuurdesem het gehele deeg zuur maakt
5079041 nooit eerder in de 20 ste eeuw de kerk zoveel hooggekwalificeerde gelovige geleerden heeft vergaard om onze schriften en theologie te verlichten en onze tradities en ons kerkelijk werk
5079042 bijna alle moderne geleerden zijn van mening dat net zoals de andere boeken van de pentateuch genesis een composiet is van verschillende bronnen en tradities belichaamt die in sommige gevallen teruggaan tot mozes
5079043 zoals in het geval van genesis werden er vele strengen van literaire traditie sommige erg oud en andere zo laat als de 6 de eeuw v c verenigd in de opmaak van de boeken
5079044 zijn samenstelling wordt algemeen gedateerd op de 7 de eeuw v c maar rust op een veel oudere traditie deels uit mozes tijd
5079045 deze topgeleerden zijn gelovigen die tot de kerk willen spreken
5079046 de dageraad van een nieuw tijdperk new age in religieuze geleerdheid vertegenwoordigen
5079047 9 werkt verder met zijn verraderlijk zuurdeeg om de weg voor te bereiden van de komende antichrist
5079048 wees samen mijn navolgers broeders en let scherp op hen die zo wandelen zoals u ons tot een voorbeeld hebt want velen ik heb het u dikwijls van hen gezegd en zeg het nu ook wenend wandelen als de vijanden van het kruis van christus hun einde is het verderf hun god is de buik en hun heerlijkheid is in hun schande overspelers en overspeelsters weet gij niet dat de vriendschap der wereld een vijandschap gods is
5079049 ik zou willen betogen dat de waarheid van pasen niet afhankelijk is van een lege tombe of wat er ook gebeurd is met het lichaam van jezus
5079050 een ieder die overtreedt en niet blijft in de leer van christus die heeft god niet die in de leer van christus blijft deze heeft beide de vader en de zoon indien iemand tot u komt en deze leer niet brengt ontvangt hem niet in huis en zegt tot hem niet wees gegroet
5079051 omdat wright zoals voor velen van de geleerden waarmee ik sprak de meest verontrustende moeilijkheden liggen in hun verhouding met conservatieve christenen
5079052 zullen twee te zamen wandelen tenzij dat zij bijeengekomen zijn eens geworden zijn
5079053 richard hays verzet zich echter tegen elke poging om de divergente zienswijzen van nieuwtestamentische auteurs te harmoniseren dat betekent soms dat hij het ene evangelie tegen het andere opzet zelfs concluderend dat het ene historisch accuraat is hij is niet afgestemd op een begrip van de schrift als zou die inerrant zijn niet omdat hij er moeite mee heeft in wonderen te geloven of schriftuurlijke geboden te gehoorzamen maar omdat hij denkt dat inerrantie als theorie ertoe neigt iemand blind te maken voor de realiteiten van de teksten zelf zijn versie van evangelisme een meer wesleyaanse zegt hij is ge nteresseerd in de levende effecten van de schrift meer dan in theorie n van inspiratie
5079054 gelooft dat jezus zijn leven bestemde voor dat moment in de geschiedenis niet voor tijdloze waarheden
5079055 overbeschermend zijn voor bepaalde lezingen van de bijbel kan tot afgoderij leiden
5079056 totdat de hemel en de aarde voorbijgaan zal er niet n jota noch n tittel van de wet voorbijgaan totdat het alles zal zijn geschied

5079076 la guerra ruso georgiana que marcar el verano de 2008 es un conflicto tradicional entre dos estados en torno a un desaf o aparentemente claro la suerte de osetia del sur pero se deriva sobre todo de la voluntad despiadada de ambas partes de cuestionar los equilibrios geopol ticos existentes desde hace casi veinte a os

5079104 you inspired us as time after time we watched you thunder into overdrive to win a race in the last few meters
5079105 what would you eat if you had to eat 12 000 calories a day just to maintain your weight
5079106 wouldnt that be lovely and since its a fantasy can we pretend that i would have to do this without spending thirty hours a week in the pool or the gym
5079107 yep dip lots and lots and lots of dip i would fulfill my cherished dream of having a vat of that crab and cream cheese dip they serve at receptions over at queer the turtle u all to myself i would eat tons of it every single day and i would never be embarrassed about anyone noticing me going back for more
5079108 okay thats maybe 3000 calories what else would you eat
5079109 i love the idea of pancakes and fried egg sandwiches so id borrow that from phelps but i think id add some fried chicken and cream gravy into the mix and huge bowls of mashed potatoes of course
5079110 true but we have similar taste in high calorie cuisine
5079111 although her 12 000 calorie diet would differ from yours in some respects
5079112 i suppose she would probably skip the dips and have boxes of godiva truffles for mid morning and late afternoon snacks washed down with several beers of course
5079113 oh thats easy if we were on 12 000 calorie diets we would dine every night at bens chili bowl downtown its dcs high church of high fat low down cuisine i can see us tucking into their famous half smokes and a big order of chili cheese fries with a big ole slice of cake pineapple coconut for me german chocolate for goose for dessert we had food from bens last night when we went to see t he nationals get their butts kicked by the colorado rockies the game sucked but goose declared the food nasty great isnt that poetic she has such a way with words and wouldnt it be swell to be able to eat that way every day without gaining weight
5079114 moose hey earth to moose come in please fantasys over watch this video by our favorite chick reporter wendy reiger on what women over fifty need to do in order to reach and maintain a healthy weight
5079115 shoot rox do i have to i mean im guessing wendys plan doesnt include vast quantities of dip and spending thirty hours a week trolling the internets does it besides im not fifty yet
5079116 tick tock moose fifty is right around the corner and youve kind of slacked off on your commitment to the tim russert memorial lifestyle adjustment plan let the olympics inspire you let wendy motivate you let the prospect of not fitting into any of your clothes when school starts focus you
5079117 wait rox you know we could sign on with the cause of fat acceptance there is a strong feminist argument to be made against the obsessive focus on physical perfection
5079118 of course there is you are not seeking a perfect body moose you are seeking a healthy body and a reasonable balance of work and play
5079119 i hate the winding down of summer rox the end of olympic swimming the changing of the seasons the gearing up for another school year the inexorable passage of time as we make our sad slow march to the grave
5079120 uh huh watch wendys vid moose and then its back to work

5079149 mr e do you have to switch i mean its not like youre not getting great results with your brush and ink i guess it depends on working situations but hey if it aint broke
5079150 even if you were able to get satisfying results with the tools all operating to your liking would you give up traditional media in favour of now working digitally
5079151 radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5079152 im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5079153 margaret thatcher in her time realised that the big challenge was reviving britains economy and we should recognise that the challenge for the modern conservatives is reviving our society
5079154 its dealing with the issues of family breakdown welfare dependency failing schools crime and the problems that we see in too many of our communities
5079155 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5079156 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5079157 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5079158 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5079159 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5079160 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5079161 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5079162 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5079163 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5079164 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5079165 im so impressed with how unconventional you are and how you dont use societys standards to measure your success
5079166 encouraging genealogy is an effective method of combating racism by understanding the diversity of ones own background celebrating or at least respecting the diversity of others becomes more likely
5079167 genealogy can also be a spur to education we will pay more attention to history and geography if our families are caught up in it there is also the sobering thought that as we evaluate our ancestors we focus on what our descendants will think of us if they can be bothered to find out
5079168 they wouldnt let me get to the new zealand flag
5079169 to try and manhandle me was probably not a good idea she tried but i was eventually able to get the flag
5079170 the people who know anything about the vice presidential process on our campaign are not talking about it
5079171 it has a lower profile but it will be an issue in peoples minds
5079172 the bigger issues will be the economy terrorism healthcare energy
5079173 somewhat of an odd place to stand around dont you think
5079174 when we were at the three broomsticks why did you tease ron like that
5079175 alright i thought you and ron could use a little help
5079176 cmon you two obviously have something going on you saw how ron flipped out when i was coming on to you it was an obvious joke and he still couldnt take it
5079177 if thats what you really think then why would you even bother asking me about it
5079178 hes so stubborn why cant he just tell me what hes thinking or feeling without me having to pry then when i do he only gets angry again and were right back where we started
5079179 he doesnt work like that and neither do you for that matter when was the last time you walked up to him and said hey ron im hot for your body lets make out or something never thats when
5079180 you told him this morning that you were going to invite him to the christmas party so thats a good start dress up nice let those boobs hang out a little and sparks will fly i guarantee it
5079181 relax hermione he wants you believe me i know the look here you are all worried that youre not attractive enough because youre a bookworm or whatever and all he wants is for you to sit on his face
5079182 you have absolutely nothing to worry about with the possible exception of pregnancy youve seen his family so you know youre rolling some loaded dice with those genes
5079183 but i will ask him to the christmas party like i said i would
5079184 swell now wed better hit it if we want to get to class on time
5079185 what were you doing in front of the headmasters office

5079188 dont even go there take a deep breath and chill out
5079189 now youre gonna throw a fit about it relax take a breath
5079190 i dont know man i wasnt here why dont you ask her
5079191 then go be all pissed at her without her knowing why
5079192 and when she stops talking to you youll never find out hows that sound big guy
5079193 just that you want to hate this krum guy but hes not here so youre mad at her instead
5079194 dont start a row with hermione over some ancient history for one thing my ears will thank you
5079195 i dont think youve got anything to worry about you guys know hermione better than me but i just cant see her doing anything with this krum dude yo what kind of name is
5079196 anyway the goods are intact if you get what im saying the cherry remains unpicked so dont get your knickers in a twist over some kindergarten level foreplay theres been more hardcore shit aired on disney if it was any more innocent itd be a precious moments collectible i could put it on a billboard and sell breath mints youd be more likely to get a boner from sunday school im running out of one liners lets go to bed
5079197 whatever just dont freeze out hermione for something your sister said you dig
5079198 i really dont want to deal with another round of this bullshit talk to me again when youre ready to man up
5079199 i feel a stirring deep within me at the sight and while that might be chalked up to the green chilli my sister sent me i think its the gryffindor pride
5079200 wed better hurry or we might not get good seats
5079201 ill be sittin with dumbledore an the other teachers today

5079209 youre nargle free for now are you happy for ron and hermione
5079210 very they were wrong for a long time but now theyre almost right so it will probably be okay
5079211 i hope so i dont want to be around the tower if they start fighting all the time
5079212 but first id like to put my hat away i wouldnt want to set it down at the party for someone to accidentally sit on
5079213 i think theyd get quite a surprise if they did
5079214 nothing like a lions head up your ass to ruin your day
5079215 were going to play a card game that scott knows do you want to play

5079227 aqu intentan castrar a todos los funcionarios de gobierno lo cual es absurdo
5079228 no me parece correcto que en vez de dar se ales de unidad siempre haya un intento en algunos dirigentes de la udi en este caso coloma de minimizar la opci n de pi era diciendo que despu s de las municipales esto se puede derrumbar no he visto una opini n constructiva de parte de coloma siempre agorero de los malos resultados pi era va a apoyar a todos los candidatos que se lo pidan

5079232 adem s existe un sistema tributario injusto heredado en lo fundamental de la dictadura porque el sistema tributario descansa en los impuestos indirectos como el iva que aunque las empresas tributen m s como el a o pasado siempre es superior al 40 y eso est provocando una revuelta tributaria en grupos medios las personas sienten que pagan impuestos muy altos en comparaci n a las empresas
5079233 the democratic party does not have a nominee or even a presumptive nominee
5079234 there is a great deal of anger and animosity among them about what is going on
5079235 howard dean does not choose the nominee house speaker nancy pelosi does not choose the nominee the press does not choose the nominee
5079236 senator clintons name must be placed in nomination and her supporters must be allowed to make speeches on behalf of her candidacy
5079237 when people believe the game is being rigged they generally dont go to the game
5079238 you might love baseball and enjoy going to the games but you wouldnt pay good money to watch a world series if the outcome was already decided
5079239 but it wont happen if they do it by ramming him down the throats of the party members

5079288 the authorities took some half a dozen coaches but nobody asked me i talk to my boys daily and am seeing their performances on television the authorities dont think much of me anyways not long ago they had lambasted my methods and told me to understand what the olympics are before preparing boys for it
5079289 there was a lot of pressure on me to change his style but the boy was confident of playing in this manner moreover i had carefully devised this approach after having studied clips of past matches and gleaning information from sports journals i even met three time olympic gold medalist lazio papp of hungry for his inputs so i persisted and as they say nothing succeeds like success
5079290 this land has a sports culture but initially people would pick on sports to bag that reserved seat for sportspersons in government departments especially the police but the success of these three boys has made them look at it as a full time career also the boys are from very modest backgrounds which makes their success all the more creditable

5079383 our loss rates are fairly stable and the growth is whats killing us
5079384 there is a tipping point that we have started to reach
5079385 there is a much larger percentage of officers planning to get out right at 20 years and once they are gone they are gone
5079386 we are overworked because of the shortages and have nothing to look forward to but another rotation to afghanistan or iraq so everything weighs towards getting out
5079387 as i look to the future i see the choices i am offered narrowing and the freedom of decision i had start to go away because of the shortages
5079388 i was originally scheduled to get my masters and go teach and that was derailed by deployments that window is gone for me now
5079389 the exodus is expected to continue as more officers are leaving sooner because of the strain multiple deployments are having on families

returning when he calls us back you need not feel sad that i am leaving you the moola granthas sarva moola and their commentaries will be your guiding light never give up their study under a worthy master the lord has blessed us with this priceless life just to study them the shastras have an answer for all our mundane problems follow the shastras and listen to the words of the enlightened put into practice as much as you can whatever you learn the shastraic way of life is the royal road to peace prosperity and happiness the search for knowledge is never easy as the upanishads say it is like walking on the razors edge but for those who have strong faith and put in sustained effort and have the blessings of sri hari and sri madhvacharya this is not difficult always keep away from people who merely perform miracles without following the shastras and yet call themselves god or guru i have performed miracles and so have great persons like srimadacharya these are based on yoga siddhi and the shastras there is no fraud or trickery at all these miracles were performed only to show the greatness of god and the wonderful powers that one can attain with his grace right knowledge jnana is greater than any miracle without this no real miracle can take place any miracle performed without this right knowledge is only witchcraft no good will come to those who perform such miracles and also those who believe in them the lord is full of auspicious qualities and absolutely faultless there is no virtue that does not exist in him he is the lord of ramaa brahma and all other devathas at all times and in all ways his form is beyond prakrithi nature his body is made up of jnana and ananda he is omnipresent and omniscient all the jivas are subservient to him mahalaksmi who is ever liberated is his consort all jivas souls are not equal there is gradation amongst them and they are of three types whatever state they attain finally is in keeping with their intrinsic nature the sattvik souls attain moksha which is a state of eternal bliss the tamasic souls attain eternal hell where there is all pervading darkness this is a state of eternal sorrow the rajasic souls keep rotating in samsara always experiencing both happiness and sorrow the shastras declare such a three fold classification and gradation of souls it can be seen everywhere in this world there are several schools of philosophy which go against these tenets and declare that there is no god no dharma this world is false there is nothing but void the jivas and brahma are the same there is no three fold classification or gradation all the jivas are equal to brahma the vedas are not true brahman is nirguna attribute less nirakara formless none of these philosophies are correct the world that we see is real this world has a master he is neither nirguna nornirakara the shastras declare him to be nirguna and nirakara because he is devoid of the three qualities of sattva rajas and tamas unlike us for the suffering soul his grace is the only means to attain salvation which is eternal bliss those who forsake him will never be truly happy without right living right thinking will never come right living is performing ones ordained duties according to ones station in life without hankering after the fruits of the actions and on the other hand offeringall ones activities to the lord this is real sadachara right living this is real karma yoga another facet of right living is performing right rituals and observing fasts fasting on ekadashi and krishnashtami is compulsory for everyone both men and women belonging to all walks of life have to observe this those who give up this will always have the doors of the lords home closed this is what the shastras declare observance of chaturmasya vrata is another compulsory mode of worship along with this vishnupanchaka and other vaishnava vratas can be performed according to ones capacity the main goal of all such vratas is to earn his grace and love one should always be careful never to harm or hurt another philosophical thought is very necessary for the souls growth without philosophical thought we can not arrive at the right conclusions but let there be no personal enmity social work done for the good of worthy people should also be considered as the lords worship in short our life itself is a worship every action is a puja this life is precious every second of our life is precious not even a second that has gone will come back listening to the right shastras and always remembering him is the highest duty without this life becomes meaningless have devotion to the lord this devotion should never be blind faith accepting the lords supremacy wholeheartedly is true devotion blind faith is not devotion it is only stupidity we should have devotion not only for the lord but also for all other deities and preceptors in keeping with their status in short having devotion to those above us goodwill amongst those who are our equals and having affection for those who are below us are the excellent values of life anybody who approaches you should not go heavy at heart or empty handed spirituality can never exist without social grace and social life without spirituality is no life at all spirituality never denies any virtue but always remember that the lord is the home of all values the world does not exist for our sole pleasure and enjoyment the thought that we are here for the good of the world is real spirituality while incorporating right thinking and right values in our life we should also make it a habit to give up wrong values and wrong thinking if we do not fight against them it amounts to approving them but such disapproval should never turn to cruelty it should be within the limits of justice the outstanding feature of this should be love for truth and not personal hatred this is our philosophy this is srimadacharyaa philosophy this is the philosophy all the shastras proclaim this is the philosophy that kings and sages like janaka and sanaka believed and followed the lords devotees like dhruva and prahlada incorporated this philosophy in their lives those who believe and live by this philosophy will never come to any harm is the assurance of the lord being gods devotees you should honour and respect his devotees help as much as you can those who seek your aid but always remember your duties offer all your actions to the lord and never hanker after temporal gains all actions performed with a selfish motive is like milk turned sour there can be no higher motive than the motive to please god and the motive of earning jnana right knowledge but giving up all actions and following unworthy methods is like taking poison which will destroy us completely it was srimadacharya who preached this wonderful philosophy the same vayu who manifested as hanumantha to serve lord sri rama and as bhimasena to serve lord sri krishna also manifested as srimadacharya and preached this philosophy this was his service to lord sri vedavyasa his life like his works was philosophy itself now i take leave of you though i will not be with you in person my presence will be in my works and in my brindavan you can serve me best by propagating studying preserving and listening to my works my blessings to you

5079433 they have abandoned their responsibilities acting like boys instead of men and the foundations of our families are weaker because of it
5079434 dont get carried away with that eighth grade graduation youre supposed to graduate from eighth grade
5079435 i know how hard it is to get kids to eat properly
5079436 but i also know that folks are letting our children drink eight sodas a day which some parents do or you know eat a bag of potato chips for lunch buy a little desk or put that child at the kitchen table watch them do their homework
5079437 iraq is a sovereign country and it can make decisions based on how it feels that it wants to move forward in its development of its oil resources
5079438 we pretend it is not a centerpiece of our motivation yet we keep confirming that it is
5079439 and we undermine our own veracity by citing issues like sovereignty when we have our hands right in the middle of it
5079440 when people will argue that edgar martinez is a better hitter than jim rice was because of ops you know its a damned retarded stat
5079441 yeah as if after rice in the lineup a pitcher couldnt get stung by an intentional walk by the other big hitters in the sox lineups of rices era versus the mariners who followed edgar in the lineup lol the more you argue the tinier your baseball brain shrinks fool
5079442 i would have loved to see jim rice play in the era of the postage stamp sized strike zone a strike zone that made mediocre players like dante bichette and luis gonzalez and even brady anderson into superstars scary isnt it
5079443 all you old n as time is up we heard your voice we saw your marching we heard your sermons we dont wanna hear that sh no more its a new day its a new voice im here now we dont need jesse im here i got this we got barack we got david banners and young jeezys were the voice now

5079446 it was quintessential guant namo where things are rarely what they seem
5079447 another military mantra is that the tribunal is open and transparent
5079448 so it was in keeping with the contradictions of guant namo that the hamdan trial in many ways looked like an american trial and in many ways did not
5079449 the defense was permitted to call witnesses but the defense lawyers said remoteness and lack of cooperation from the government meant that was sometimes impossible one witness who might have been powerful in the courtroom mr hamdans wife could not make it to the trial she appeared instead in a muffled videotape
5079450 are you engaged in an extramarital affair have you been

5079459 im very fortunate to have your attention and possibly trust and im certainly not going to blow it for a few bucks but im not naive enough to believe that there are no conflicts there are plenty of them people and ideas that i have an irrational attachment to or habits ive got that are hard to break im hoping that wont get in the way of provoking you to think a little differently

5079475 but if a computer cant read such a captcha how does the system know the correct answer to the puzzle heres how each new word that cannot be read correctly by ocr is given to a user in conjunction with another word for which the answer is already known the user is then asked to read both words if they solve the one for which the answer is known the system assumes their answer is correct for the new one the system then gives the new image to a number of other people to determine with higher confidence whether the original answer was correct

5079477 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

5079480 we believe in liberty and justice for all so of course we oppose many us government policies it means we believe in freedom as more than merely a cliche

5079498 they cant believe this is happening in america that in a big city like fort worth theres a cowboy walking down the street or on the back of a horse
5079499 if we was trying to take two head down the street they would probably run off on us but if we take them all or eight to 10 at least theyll all stick together

5079512 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5079513 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5079514 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5079515 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5079516 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

5079518 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5079519 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5079520 sacrilegious though this may sound democracy is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead the complexity and the technical nature of many of todays problems do not always allow elected representatives to make competent decisions at the right time
5079521 a group of world citizens sharing a common concern for the future of humanity
5079522 if the present growth trends in world population industrialization pollution food production and resource depletion continue unchanged the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years the most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity
5079523 it is possible to alter these growth trends and to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future the state of global equilibrium could be designed so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize his individual human potential
5079524 the overwhelming growth in world population caused by the positive birth rate loop is a recent phenomenon a result of mankinds very successful reduction of worldwide mortality the controlling negative feedback loop has been weakened allowing the positive loop to operate virtually without constraint there are only two ways to restore the resulting imbalance either the birth rate must be brought down to equal the new lower death rate or the death rate must rise again
5079525 the result of stopping population growth in 1975 and industrial capital growth in 1985 with no other changes is that population and capital reach constant values at a relatively high level of food industrial output and services per person eventually however resource shortages reduce industrial output and the temporarily stable state degenerates
5079526 man possesses for a small moment in his history the most powerful combination of knowledge tools and resources the world has ever known he has all that is physically necessary to create a totally new form of human society one that would be built to last for generations the two missing ingredients are a realistic long term goal that can guide mankind to the equilibrium society and the human will to achieve that goal
5079527 without such a goal and a commitment to it short term concerns will generate the exponential growth that drives the world system toward the limits of the earth and ultimate collapse with that goal and that commitment mankind would be ready now to begin a controlled orderly transition from growth to global equilibrium
5079528 this is the way we are setting the scene for mankinds encounter with the planet the opposition between the two ideologies that have dominated the 20th century has collapsed forming their own vacuum and leaving nothing but crass materialism
5079529 modern industrial civilisation is fast outstripping the earths natural regenerative and life supporting capacity
5079530 at current rates of resource depletion and environmental degradation a near complete collapse of ecological integrity will occur within the next 100 years
5079531 gaia our mother who nutured humanity for countless millenia within her womb of evolution is dying
5079532 a small window of opportunity now exists to transform humanity into a sustainable global interdepedant society based on respect and reverence for earth
5079533 a radical change from the current trajectory is required a complete reordering of global society
5079534 humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy
5079535 at this time a new enemy must be found one either real or invented for the purpose
5079536 democracy has failed us a new system of global governance based on environmental imperatives must be implemented quickly
5079537 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5079538 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5079539 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5079540 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5079541 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5079542 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5079543 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5079544 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5079545 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5079546 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5079547 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5079548 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5079549 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5079550 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5079551 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5079552 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5079553 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5079554 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5079555 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5079556 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5079557 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5079558 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5079559 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5079560 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5079561 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5079562 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5079563 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5079564 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5079565 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5079566 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5079567 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5079568 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5079569 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5079570 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5079571 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5079572 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5079573 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5079574 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5079575 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5079576 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5079577 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5079578 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5079579 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5079580 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5079581 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5079582 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5079583 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5079584 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5079617 after giving hillary clinton a speaking role on tuesday night and bill clinton a speaking role on wednesday night now hillary clintons going to get her name placed in nomination and to have a roll call question is that the way president obama would negotiate to just keep caving in
5079618 obama has agreed and from what im told from people in the obama camp this wasnt something they were happy about claire mccaskill to the contrary not withstanding to have hillary clintons name placed in nomination and to have a roll call vote smart politics or a show of weakness
5079619 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
5079620 what do you think would be best in terms of bringing us all together

5079647 en las guerras del siglo xx hubo el triple de muertos que en todas las guerras desde el siglo i despu s de cristo hasta 1899

5079650 en los ltimos d as se presentar n tiempos cr ticos dif ciles de manejar
5079651 mas sabe esto que en los ltimos d as se presentar n tiempos cr ticos dif ciles de manejar porque los hombres ser n amadores de s mismos amadores del dinero presumidos altivos blasfemos desobedientes a los padres desagradecidos desleales sin tener cari o natural no dispuestos a ning n acuerdo calumniadores sin autodominio feroces sin amor del bien 4 traicioneros testarudos hinchados de orgullo amadores de placeres m s bien que amadores de dios teniendo una forma de devoci n piadosa pero resultando falsos a su poder y de estos ap rtate

5079656 despu s de estas cosas vi y miren una gran muchedumbre que ning n hombre pod a contar de todas las naciones y tribus y pueblos y lenguas de pie delante del trono y delante del cordero vestidos de largas ropas blancas y hab a ramas de palmera en sus manos
5079657 y ser n objeto de odio de parte de toda la gente por causa de mi nombre
5079658 esto toma en cuenta que es justo por parte de dios pagar con tribulaci n a los que les causan tribulaci n pero a ustedes que sufren la tribulaci n con alivio juntamente con nosotros al tiempo de la revelaci n del se or jes s desde el cielo con sus poderosos ngeles en fuego llameante al traer l venganza sobre los que no conocen a dios y sobre los que no obedecen las buenas nuevas acerca de nuestro se or jes s estos mismos sufrir n el castigo judicial de destrucci n eterna de delante del se or y de la gloria de su fuerza

5079662 y consider monos unos a otros para incitarnos al amor y a las obras excelentes sin abandonar el reunirnos como algunos tienen por costumbre sino anim ndonos unos a otros y tanto m s al contemplar ustedes que el d a se acerca

5079666 presten atenci n a s mismos para que sus corazones nunca lleguen a estar cargados debido a comer con exceso y beber con exceso y por las inquietudes de la vida y de repente est aquel d a sobre ustedes instant neamente como un lazo porque vendr sobre todos los que moran sobre la haz de toda la tierra mant nganse despiertos pues en todo tiempo haciendo ruego para que logren escapar de todas estas cosas que est n destinadas a suceder y estar en pie es decir aprobados delante del hijo del hombre
5079667 porque tanto am dios al mundo que dio a su hijo unig nito para que todo el que ejerce fe en l no sea destruido sino que tenga vida eterna

5079690 tanto am dios al mundo que dio a su hijo unig nito para que todo el que ejerce fe en l no sea destruido sino que tenga vida eterna

5079718 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5079719 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5079720 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5079721 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5079722 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5079723 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5079724 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5079725 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5079726 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5079727 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5079728 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5079729 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5079730 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5079731 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5079732 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5079733 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5079734 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5079735 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5079736 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5079737 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5079738 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5079739 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5079740 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
5079741 but if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
5079742 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
5079743 to go through 72 holes without bogeying would have been pretty wishful thinking
5079744 they surrounded the home inside were a husband and wife and their two toddlers
5079745 they had very limited social skills so they were kind of immature
5079746 i think it was a power trip for him it was his way of being the big man
5079747 cuanto mas conozco a los hombres mas me gustan los gatos
5079748 allah the most merciful amp peaceful shall butcher all christians hindus sikhs budists atheists ifedles
5079749 if you truly did hate your last boss i would be prepared to articulate why your last organization and relationship was not right for you
5079750 then be prepared to explain what type of organization is right for you and what type of management style you best respond to
5079751 there is no excuse for having no knowledge of a company except laziness and or poor planning neither of which are attributes of potential employees sought by many organizations
5079752 understand the business strategy goals and people having this type of knowledge will give you some questions to keep in your pocket if the conversation is not flowing naturally
5079753 we all have lives and commitments and any employer that you would even consider working for understands this if you progress to an offer stage this is the time for a discussion regarding personal obligations
5079754 just dont bring it up prior to the salary negotiation offer stage
5079755 there are many tactful ways to ask this question that will show an employer that you are ambitious and looking at the big picture
5079756 for example asking the interviewer to explain the typical career path for the position is fine
5079757 this sounds obvious but many times i have been interviewing candidates and been asked about my personal hobbies family obligations et cetera
5079758 attempting to develop a rapport is essential but taking it too far can bring you into some uncomfortable territory
5079759 this is a conversation between a couple humans that are trying to get a good understanding of one another act accordingly
5079760 ive been to this celebration before and its definitely getting better each year
5079761 theres a lot for the kids to do and they seem to be enjoying it
5079762 after this im going to get food ice cream and look for a diaper bag
5079763 private trust accounts established by senator mccains late keating five scandal and bush 41 money launderer leonard millman who was also stewart webbs father in law all of which screams for a federal probe before the november 4 election
5079764 military personnel should be able to purchase beer in the most convenient way possible
5079765 a lot of vehicles were being filled with premium and people were paying at the pump
5079766 were actually pretty confident that by 2010 the majority of our media mix will shift to digital
5079767 they are the first generation to be defined more by their means of communication rather than fashion or music
5079768 one for him one for her both fresh yet warm a tension that creates sexiness
5079769 the first hitter of the game and you know i have some anxiety and some nerves but i think i got him out on two pitches and after that batter i was feeling a little better but for whatever reason i started to miss the zone a little bit more it became a struggle and i really had to battle but i think mostly i was just trying a little too hard
5079770 the count was 3 2 and i was hoping hed throw me a fastball because id swung and missed at a slider in my earlier at bat
5079771 he broke my bat and luckily i was able to get it up over jimmy rollins head i guess its better to be lucky than good
5079772 i was able to get a ball out over the plate and do something with it
5079773 i feel good about the win and helping the team win is the most important thing
5079774 i would like to have thrown fewer pitches and been able to have gone longer in the game as a starter you dont want to come out after five innings but im happy i was able to keep the game close and keep them in the game and contribute a little bit they put up some runs
5079775 that was great good stuff coming out of the pen as far as good fastballs with a lot of velocity good breaking balls from all of them it was good to see they did a nice job
5079776 in a lot of cases what you saw in the first inning is typical of what youll see from someone making their first major league start
5079777 a little bit erratic but he found his way as he moved into the next four innings i know that when youre in your first one youre pitching on a lot of emotion and a lot of adrenaline and it sort of saps you but he hung in there and it was good to see and

5079782 noted linguist reflects on his tumultuous foray into politics for years hes been at the center of some of the biggest intellectual disagreements in linguistics most famously with noam chomsky and has helped create an important interdisciplinary field of study cognitive linguistics that is reshaping our understanding of the complex relationship between language and thought more recently he has been vying for respect among people notoriously hard to persuade about anything politicians and their financial backers

5079786 the condition of alienation of being asleep of being unconscious of being out of ones mind is the condition of the normal man society highly values its normal man it educates children to lose themselves and to become absurd and thus to be normal normal men have killed perhaps 100 000 000 of their fellow normal men in the last fifty years
5079787 it was like the blood couldnt go to my face
5079788 since he pulled out his feeding tube well see how he does
5079789 he can probably hear you if you want to talk to him
5079790 he doesnt remember to call the nurse he doesnt remember why hes here he doesnt remember why these things are attached
5079791 at first he remembered them all but before she left she asked again he could only remember one
5079792 when i saw him on friday i didnt think he was going to make it
5079793 they said they dont allow officers children to become priests
5079794 hes so eager he just wants to go home i told him the only thing he can do is relax and get well then he can take care of things what can he do now anyway
5079795 she had a little bit of pink in her cheeks today
5079796 i was panicking during the meet because i didnt feel good whatsoever and it showed it was a challenge but luckily i was able to make the top 12
5079797 it was a real struggle for me because i didnt feel like myself out there
5079798 and when you dont feel like yourself you lose confidence it was like just do the best that you can do to be your normal self and thats what i did
5079799 so it was a good dive but im going to leave what happened saturday night at the pool and start all over again
5079800 but think the state is only an instrument everything depends on who has control of that instrument which can so easily be transformed into a weapon its unwise to assume even with our heightened wariness of tyranny a continuation of a tradition of liberalism a new hitler could arise in europe and be overjoyed by a civil service thinking in the old terms of restraint and democratic rights undoubtedly the computers of the new world will have jews neatly listed as well as dangerous intellectual free thinkers

5079805 owning and running a small business is an extremely time consuming but ultimately very rewarding experience
5079806 given that the stakes are so high it comes as no surprise that britains entrepreneurs are burning the midnight oil to try to make a success of their business
5079807 unfortunately however there is a clear downside to the pursuit of success for some small business owners with increased stress levels
5079808 we know from our own experience of working with small businesses that one of the biggest problems they face is the amount of time spent dealing with administration and regulation
5079809 if we can create an environment for small business in britain that helps smes work smarter by allowing them to get on with the job of running their business then we will continue to see smes grow and prosper

5079823 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5079824 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5079825 there was no problem with safety there have been briefings everything has been above board in that respect

5079827 people come to new zealand and dont understand just how fast the weather can change
5079828 they are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5079829 just the last couple of days sitting around in a tent watching helicopters go in the wrong direction looking for us not what i went there hoping for
5079830 you can get weather like that in summer you just get more of it in winter
5079831 it was a good time of year for us to go up there and its not crowded with other people
5079832 you have heard that it was said eye for eye and tooth for tooth
5079833 you have heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i tell you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be sons of your father in heaven he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous

5079840 gori sits along only georgias only significant east west highway which means occupying the city allowed the russians effectively to split the nation in two
5079841 he was in his 40s with a bald patch and was kissing her breasts the blonde looked a bit younger and had a slim build
5079842 but they couldnt see or hear us and just carried on regardless as we all cheered
5079843 there were lots of us outside when the pcsos went in then someone knocked told them they could be seen and they ducked down fast
5079844 if any of the private firms express interest of course we would comply with the new regulation and allow them to do it
5079845 what we want to do is make sure everyone is aware of it the new regulation and has an opportunity to ask to participate if they want to
5079846 we are trying to be very inclusive and notify everyone we can find
5079847 were calling them on the phone and inviting them to a meeting
5079848 if they are interested we got to let them provide that service essentially not interfere with them providing the service
5079849 as i look at it the days go by so fast
5079850 the next thing you know its going to be the end of the season already
5079851 i cant miss any practices this is my last chance to play
5079852 he was a walk on and undersized but we saw a lot of potential
5079853 hes just a kid whos always bought into the fundamentals of the program he paid attention to the linemen who played before him and took coaching from them as well as the coaches
5079854 hes shown me a lot of mistakes ive made in the past and i try to do my best to improve on it
5079855 i think i just have to work on my hands my punch getting guys off of me
5079856 its still in my mind every day somebody mentions it
5079857 it puts a chip on my shoulder and keeps me driving every day makes me work harder and prepare for our bigger opponents
5079858 our defense is giving us a good fast look every day and were playing at a fast tempo trying to make it as stressful for them as possible
5079859 is the offense related to the type of work that ill have you doing as an employee of mine
5079860 well no i dont want to tell them i have background
5079861 why are you doing all those things if youre not really giving them a job
5079862 oh im just a typical american boy from a typical american town i believe in god and senator dodd and a keepin old castro down and when it came my time to serve i knew better dead than red but when i got to my old draft board buddy this is what i said chorus sarge im only eighteen i got a ruptured spleen and i always carry a purse i got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthmas getting worse yes think of my career my sweetheart dear and my poor old invalid aunt besides i aint no fool im a goin to school and im working in a dee fense plant

5079867 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5079868 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5079869 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5079870 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5079871 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5079872 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5079873 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it
5079874 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5079875 lee county public schools will be open for the first day of the 2008 09 school year which is monday august 18th 2008 the district will be operating under normal conditions i e buses will run their routes schools will adhere to their bell times etc
5079876 throughout the day monday district officials will continue to work closely with local emergency management officials to determine the districts course of action for the days after monday based on the threat tropical storm fay may pose to our area
5079877 whenever new information on the status of lee county public schools is available it will be conveyed to the community and media as quickly as possible
5079878 the focus of this meeting was to encourage the cities if possible to have mutual agreements on things like curfews
5079879 if we could all agree to have a sunset to sunrise curfew for instance that would make it much easier on the citizens so they arent going from one municipality to the next and suddenly theyre in curfew violation
5079880 hopefully if we can be done by 8 or 9 p m that should give council city staff and residents attending the meeting enough time to get to safety
5079881 we wouldnt want it to drag on into the wee hours of tuesday morning
5079882 it is time for people to begin making plans if they live in manufactured homes or on barrier islands
5079883 people should continue to monitor media outlets for the latest information
5079884 all 11 counties here in southwest florida are making all of our plans on the assumptions that we will be hit by a category 1 hurricane which is what its projected to be
5079885 ive been through worse but its good to be ready just in case
5079886 there will be more storms and its obviously a good idea for every homeowner to apply for insurance
5079887 during hurricane charley we were coming in that day but they called us in the night before
5079888 they may scale that down this year since it doesnt appear this will be the same size storm but well have to wait and see
5079889 we work closely with the folks at the emergency operations center and assist in areas from evacuations to adjusting our shifts and calling in our people depending on the severity of things
5079890 the issue with charley was all the homes under construction and all the building materials that we were afraid would be flying all over the place
5079891 but foreclosed homes are probably not as big of a concern as long as they are in a good state
5079892 we have pretty much everything you need except for food

5079902 bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than defuse them
5079903 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
5079904 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
5079905 more or less on the same page in decrying the aggression
5079906 the new john mccain has embraced those kind of tactics
5079907 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war and clearly thats not what we want

5079936 it was cool its not a bad little place its a good city good neighborhoods i grew up in its not bad at all its just hot thats the only downside to it
5079937 i tried to have fun i was a little kid doing whatever i rode my dirt bike played football i played all of the sports i was pretty much an active kid school wasnt my priority back then i kind of had to pick it up in high school but i was a good little kid
5079938 i got it when i was like 8 on christmas morning my dad said hey brent go out and get the paper i opened the front door and the bike is leaning against the wall right there it was a yz 125 it was a red one i didnt even know how to ride yet i had to learn i was happy about it but it was sitting in the garage for a couple of weeks my dad taught me he put it on me he said heres the clutch here are the gears heres the gas go i got used to it and i got better and better at it
5079939 i got it three years ago and i started putting money into it
5079940 the highest ive gotten is 6 feet of air it was cool youre all strapped in youre not going anywhere
5079941 its full pads its like regular football except with three fewer guys it was fun its a lot different theres more scoring i liked it i liked running around there wasnt a playbook it was pretty simple the offense wasnt like this where its pretty complex its pretty much double out double slant stuff like that it wasnt real complicated
5079942 it was real small i think there were 250 people there there were 40 something in my graduating class everybody knew each other it was a christian school its a pretty good school but i didnt go to my senior prom im not into that
5079943 the biggest we had was two grand for one of our home games the cif championship game it seemed like a lot back then for our junior college bowl game i think we got 9 800 people thats the most ive ever played in front of that was an experience
5079944 i pitched i think thats where i got my arm strength i was a backup quarterback all through pop warner i think i threw two passes until i got to high school nobody taught me or anything like that i got in at quarterback and started throwing i dont like baseball anymore my junior year i played baseball my senior year i played golf
5079945 my family hates the bald look they want me to go back but nobody else has the spikes around here and the bald look is comfortable ive been rocking the spikes for a couple of years i dont know when i started doing it but i liked it i just grow it out gel it up i mess around you cant keep your hair the same all of the time
5079946 i got this one near his spine a couple of days after i turned 18 and i got this one on the right shoulder six months later ive been planning on it since i was 15 years old i cant really draw i told the tattoo artist who drew it up for me i said go ahead and do it i wanted it to look like someone took a razor blade cut the skin peeled it off and youd see the spine youd see the ribs youd see everything itll look pretty good when its done right now it looks pretty crappy itll get there

5079952 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia
5079953 the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
5079954 i think the russians took the wrong lessons from bucharest
5079955 there was a lot of russian pressure and rhetoric against both georgia and ukraine getting membership action plans before bucharest ive heard that russians regard bucharest as a success and what you saw after bucharest was an increase in pressure
5079956 what russia really wants is essentially to be able to do as it pleases in world affairs and to answer to nobody
5079957 it wants a totally free hand particularly in and around the cis it also needs to conjure up the idea of an enemy to justify its regime the fact of the matter is that the most immediate threat here is to georgia because the russian government could pack forces into the north caucasus to threaten georgia
5079958 we heard statements that the russian railroad troops that had entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there on a humanitarian mission and now we know the truth about why those forces were there it was to rebuild the railroad to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a russian invasion
5079959 i am afraid that there is a very strong possibility that military activity will happen this year probably in the next month
5079960 this is a war that russia wanted and clearly had planned for
5079961 the evidence ive seen indicates that the russian army was sitting there waiting for this that this was essentially a provocation launched by the south ossetians who ratcheted up the level of violence in order to bring the georgians who are easily provokable obviously to attack
5079962 and the russians were waiting there ready with an operational plan and with forces in place land sea and air to do what they have subsequently done
5079963 it is difficult to imagine that russia prepared such a provocation while neither of the countrys two leaders was in moscow
5079964 it is also difficult to imagine that russia prepared to go to war and then when saakashvili fell into the trap waited 13 or 14 hours by my count before deploying forces
5079965 russias policies over the past several years caused this war and for this they bear responsibility
