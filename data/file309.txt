3090013 we oefenden elk raceweekeinde ongeveer zestig keer een stop een reguliere stop ging gewoon vanzelf
3090014 in de eerste ronden na de start rennen wij als een dolle naar de pits toe en trekken we onze uitrusting aan die zit enorm ongemakkelijk dus daar wachten we tot het eind mee als er dan in het begin een aanrijding gebeurt sta je onmiddelijk onder druk

3090023 the problem with fms is that it didnt deliver on time

3090025 in your opinion do you think i could fight an army with those trucks
3090026 was not able to demonstrate proper accountability for and management of the iraq security forces fund and could not always demonstrate that the delivery of services equipment and construction was properly made to the iraq security forces
3090027 youll have to forgive me for being an eisenhower republican
3090028 i dont know how much you know about my grandfathers administration
3090029 but that administration stood for multilateral engagement balancing the budget
3090030 he has very little debt i just love it anybody who wants to make him out as this wide eyed liberal i just dont see any evidence for that not in the way he runs his campaign and this tells you a lot about how he can administer things how he manages things how he deals with situations
3090031 this race is very similar to the 1952 campaign that brought my grandfather to power
3090032 he was an outsider who was nominated by the republican party but it was not an easy process at all he was an outsider who threatened to shake up the party itself
3090033 it is this very weird moment where republicans are very divided
3090034 its accurate to say that you dont have a dominant set of ideas or a figure the party can really rally behind what you simply see are factions who arent forming to create a coherent vision
3090035 the 70s the great shift in american culture society and politics
3090036 youve seen this amazing united front by different factions that are much more at odds ideologically than the factions within the democratic party theyve all managed to put their feelings about one another aside to defeat a common enemy i dont think the fracturing youre seeing now will result in large numbers of republicans voting for obama but i do think youll see people willing to sit on their hands instead of work towards that common goal as they have in the past
3090037 both these parties have core constituencies that will support the party no matter what
3090038 even today george bush has a 28 percent approval rating there are cycles of american history where you see a real shift but i dont see a definitive change in party structure or alignment i see a national mood shift that gives the democrats and upper hand for the time being but if obamas elected both he and the party have to deliver
3090039 the thing we have to ask ourselves for this election is whether this is a small temporary change or permanent realignment
3090040 political parties change over decades to seize and capitalize on opportunities but what can happen whether youre a democrat or republican is you can wake up one morning and find yourself looking at a party whose standard bearer doesnt reflect the values that brought you to the party in the first place i can say that for this election im supporting barack obama because i think he will represent the future of america he is the future of america
3090041 my grandfather thought there were three things that comprised our national security one our ability to address our adversaries
3090042 by temperament and genetics i do recognize that were already there
3090043 but we have to understand that my grandfather a five star general understood that staying in korea wasnt a sustainable operation either and got the united states out of there
3090044 asking whether something is viable or not has nothing to do with patriotism
3090045 you can conclude youre damaging your long term national interests by holding the status quo one of the great expressions i grew up with as a child is perfect is the enemy of good we have to move forward in a good way because were never going to see a consensus on anything
3090046 for people who are being critical about barack obama talking about hope
3090047 i dont think they understand the first thing about american rhetoric and moving this country forward ronald reagan was not a success because he had people scared and frightened all the time he inspired thousands of people with hope when the cold war was stagnant and inflation was high and the country sour we now have another figure right now who has brought all sorts of people into the political process who has convinced a significant number of people that they were welcome on his team and has offered a crisp new chance to turn the page internationally

3090057 but i believe its a lot easier to change the constitution than it would be to change the word of the living god and thats what we need to do to amend the constitution so its in gods standards rather than try to change gods standards so it lines up with some contemporary view

3090063 no es un tema de personas sino de funcionalidad por eso yo reclamo al ministerio hacer lo contrario de lo que viene haciendo hasta ahora que demuestre iniciativa y retome una presencia muy activa con fuerza comunicacional explic ndole a la gente y trasuntando la idea de que se comprenden los problemas y se ejecutar n pol ticas correctoras

3090071 the worlds oceans have absorbed about 20 times as much heat as the atmosphere over the past half century leading to higher temperatures not only in surface waters e g depths of less than 100 feet but also down to substantial depths with the most severe warming occurring in the first 1 500 feet below the surface
3090072 this expansion combined with the inflow of water from melting land ice has raised global sea level more than one inch over the last decade
3090073 the science backing gore is simply that ice will melt and water will rise and that both may occur at dramatic rates
3090074 ive given you sufficient information to show that its very likely the scientists know what they are talking about
3090075 we are in a period of glaciation thoughout the majority of the earths geologic history it has been ice free
3090076 what is the amount of energy needed to convert ice at 0 degrees celsuis to water at 0 degrees celsius
3090077 and what is the scientific basis for al gores 20 ft sea level rise by the end of the century based on current understanding of climate and sea level trends
3090078 patronizing is expecting folk with a science background to address your questions as if you have a right to an answer
3090079 the only way to understand these characters rp jr and others is to look at what they do and the effect of what they do they carefully consider every word including the and a
3090080 this is a dramatic and disturbing event it shows that we are loosing remarkable features of the canadian north that have been in place for many thousands of years we are crossing climate thresholds and these may signal the onset of accelerated change ahead
3090081 we arent able to connect all of the dots but unusually warm temperatures definitely played a major role
3090082 the idea that vranes would talk to a few people at a conference and then proceed to speculate about
3090083 we arent able to connect all of the dots but unusually warm temperatures definitely played a major role
3090084 how did science ever survive for all those thousands of years
3090085 one thing i should make clear to anyone who is skeptical about the science of agw not the policy aspect is what factor can you provide other than elevated atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide associated with the industrial revolution for the fact that climate has not cooled further since the little ice age
3090086 the antarctic vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature of climate and of climate feedbacks over the past 420 000 years marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time but such records are often poorly resolved moreover it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from dome c antarctica that provides a climate record for the past 740 000 years for the four most recent glacial cycles the data agree well with the record from vostok the earlier period between 740 000 and 430 000 years ago was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in antarctica but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430 000 years ago termination v resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases but there are significant differences in the patterns of change the interglacial stage following termination v was exceptionally long 28 000 years compared to for example the 12 000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today our results may imply that without human intervention a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future
3090087 can we really be so sure that the world would cet par be shifting further into an ice age if we dont know the counter factual it is difficult to properly estimate our actual influence
3090088 the 14c tree ring records indicate that todays solar activity is high but not exceptional during the last 1000 years
3090089 the reconstruction by solanki et al implies generally less solar forcing during the past millennium than in the second part of the twentieth century whereas our reconstruction indicates that solar activity around ad 1150 and 1600 and in the late eighteenth century was probably comparable to the recent satellite based observations in any case as noted by solanki et al solar activity reconstructions tell us that only a minor fraction of the recent global warming can be explained by the variable sun
3090090 dano used to insist that rp roger pielke jr should say what would be acceptable phrasing so rp wouldnt have anything to harrumph about that is until dano couldnt comment any more
3090091 just yesterday i offered to eli a chance to resume posting or even clear the air over at john flecks if he eschewed the violent imagery and posted under his real name basically to ensure that any violations of decency are accountable to the real source and he said
3090092 however cooling trends have reversed in the past without our intervention
3090093 im not doubting that humans contributed to recent warming but without knowing the counter factual and i doubt that the climate will follow a neat schedule its hard to know how much to attribute to humans
3090094 also chris oneil mentions 0 8c rise in the 20th century i thought it was more like 0 6c

3090107 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3090108 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3090109 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3090110 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3090111 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3090112 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3090116 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3090117 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3090377 he asked how could they find that money when they could not find money for housing it was a very good question that i knew he would ask
3090378 i am hoping cullen will listen and understand our position from the point of view of the residents rather than the council if i was asking for money for the council i know what the answer would be

3090381 it feels like a bailout for henderson rather than a way of protecting the development vision of the council
3090382 i would have thought there were better ways like city plans and bylaws to control development

3090399 we recruit mainly in the state of california we compete with the pac 10 wac and mountain west schools
3090400 everybody comes into california to recruit and we needed a point of difference one of ours is not only do you play in the wac you are going to play in a non league schedule thats going to give you a chance for national exposure a chance to play the best teams in the country and a chance to play on national tv
3090401 this is the reason why i wanted to go to fresno state
3090402 you get the chance to play the big teams the big schedule and who knows whats going to happen i think it will be pretty exciting

3090419 your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins
3090420 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3090421 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us

3090427 so there you have it why not add hummus to your foods of choice which you can purchase from wal mart or any good health food restaurant or eastern deli the hummus with dried tomatoes is especially tasty and who knows this just might be the biblical secret food you have been looking for if it was good enough for moses and the fisherman gang it would be certainly good enough for me quote oscar wilde on hummus dam this shit is better than marmite

3090464 first point a cease fire second access to the victims the third point is the withdrawal of the troops on both sides a controlled withdrawal of the troops it means that we need controllers watchers people in charge of and a fourth most important in a way the fourth point is of course comeback to the political process and it means that the european union at least and the osce both of them they are ready to do so but for the rest well see un involvement or not etcetera lets come back to the key of the problem the key is a political key certainly not a military key
3090465 we are really seeing an absolutely unparalleled situation since many many decades in the world
3090466 this is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine and its very unfortunate that it is happening in my country i insist that its happening unprovoked by us and i insist that it was all pre planned

3090473 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
3090474 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
3090475 series by karen kingsbury which i loved then i read
3090476 by karen marie moning absolutely loved it too and i also read
3090477 it was so sad and i cried most of the book
3090478 by eugenia price its the first book in the georgia trilogy that my kids have a good first day at school
3090479 when i was on the 17 tee i felt like i was going to win the pga championship
3090480 i dont see why you have too be at the office so much
3090481 should preserve its present de facto status of an independent state
3090482 an artificial appropriation of different styles from different eras the hipster represents the end
3090483 fox poisons this country every time they air racist propaganda and try and call it news
3090484 why are we embarrassed by silence what comfort do we find in all the noise
3090485 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
3090486 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
3090487 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
3090488 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
3090489 this is a challenge for climate modelers we dont fully understand it
3090490 if we knew the answer to things like this one would have more confidence
3090491 the whole notion that something outside has to cause a change is absurd
3090492 weve looked at the sun volcanoes are not doing anything weird the oceans can dump heat into the atmosphere but theyre getting warmer too
3090493 anything you can do we certainly appreciate it it does make a difference
3090494 what happens here is going to echo across the country
3090495 somewhere along the line it seems that mr murtha has lost touch
3090496 its mind boggling that someone who has never lived in western pennsylvania has the gall to accuse anyone who lives here as being out of touch
3090497 its a great way to get out and meet people
3090498 its just sort of a neighborhood networking kind of thing
3090499 were all working 27 hours a day at this point
3090500 and congressman murtha has a legacy of working with local officials to attract jobs better health care and new roads and bridges
3090501 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3090502 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3090503 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3090504 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3090505 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3090506 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3090507 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3090508 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3090509 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3090510 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3090511 whats happening is that flooding events are all of a sudden not being labeled 50 year floods anymore
3090512 prior to that i hadnt heard anybody talking about it in the community
3090513 its more something you think that older people should take care of for us
3090514 a tasty foot long hero roll piled high with good meat and cheese at a very reasonable price be very hungry or save half for later my
3090515 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3090516 its very hard to tell your banker that hes wrong
3090517 ever wonder what washington has done with your tax dollars this olympics is your chance to find out for the last 8 years the bush administration has been paying china billions of dollars in interest on the trillions it borrowed for tax breaks pork and special privileges you never got that money helped create thousands of businesses and millions of jobs in china so as you enjoy the games keep an eye on your tax dollars at work the way our economys going its tough to pay your bills but take heart you already paid chinas
3090518 youre looking forward now to a much different life for yourself
3090519 there are some one way conversations going on cause ive said i cant talk but i certainly can listen
3090520 the thing thats important for someone with my experience to talk about is the state of politics in washington
3090521 its created what i call a extremely dysfunctional hyperpartisan senate were getting little to nothing done
3090522 could romney be planning to establish residency in california with an eye on the governors seat gov schwarzenegger is forced out by term limits in 2010 stay tuned
3090523 governor romney has been looking at property on the west coast because he has family in california and because his wife ann spends a good deal of time there riding horses
3090524 the number of deviant offenders a community can afford to recognize is likely to remain stable over time
3090525 malta is not an obvious place for a love affair to flourish not unlike staten island it tends to be a conservative place
3090526 word about the affair spread and republican officials soon became concerned fearing it would be exposed sources said
3090527 a pattern of conduct was exhibited among many individuals to remain willfully ignorant
3090528 i lost confidence in her and im not going to kid you
3090529 i was also concerned with this other relationship thing it didnt look like it should
3090530 at least 70 frivolous duplicative and repetitive actions in this court
3090531 by the time the order was issued that number had reached 82
3090532 the government can operate on its own self produced money
3090533 all superdelegates should save their endorsements for candidates with a real shot
3090534 when it comes to national security any big dog should think twice before agreeing to a long journey with mitt romney
3090535 a small varmint gun totin civil rights marching nra endorsed fantasy candidate
3090536 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
3090537 in this time of war i simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror
3090538 we cannot allow the next president of the united states to retreat in the face of evil extremism
3090539 as a lifelong hunter i didnt want to miss the start of varmint season
3090540 its tenacious coverage of the twists and turns in the scandal involving the states senator larry craig
3090541 this was news to most idaho voters who have viewed the whole affair with shock outrage embarrassment and dismay but craig didnt stop there
3090542 i know ill love it because clean air clean water and many many many mountains
3090543 my heart my mind my body my soul my thoughts are in this to win
3090544 if i save one babys life it will be worth it
3090545 voters are casting a vote for a person and not a political proposition
3090546 the people that vote for me are more intelligent than to have something defined in legislation like this
3090547 the pirates are not in a rebuilding mode were in a building mode
3090548 trolling for sex in a mens room doesnt logically require that you support gay marriage
3090549 over the course of my public life i have insisted i believe correctly that people regardless of their position or power take responsibility for their conduct i can and will ask no less of myself
3090550 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
3090551 youve got this built in campaign team with your sons
3090552 to discuss the former massachusetts governor becoming the face of conservatism
3090553 was it for this that all that blood was shed
3090554 if someone had suggested a year ago and a half ago that we would be welcoming mitt romney as a potential leader of the conservative movement no one would have believed it
3090555 but over the last year and a half he has convinced us he is one of us and walks with us
3090556 you could tell everybody at the table sitting with romney was asking himself is he the one
3090557 i sampled all of the alaskan classics moose salmon and whale oh so good
3090558 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3090559 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3090560 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3090561 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3090562 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome
3090563 i was an extra in the surrogates with bruce willis
3090564 i was in the background in a beauty shop scene
3090565 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
3090566 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
3090567 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3090568 president obama and a democratic congress will likely dole out entitlements like free health care child care and cash payments to anyone who falls under a certain income level that means that people who drink gin all day long will be getting some of my hard earned money folks who dropped out of school who are too lazy to hold a job and who smoke reefer 24 7 will all get some goodies in the mail from uncle barack and aunt nancy
3090569 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3090570 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3090571 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3090572 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3090573 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3090574 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3090575 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3090576 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3090577 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3090578 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3090579 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3090580 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3090581 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3090582 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3090583 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3090584 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3090585 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3090586 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3090587 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3090588 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3090589 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3090590 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3090591 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3090592 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3090593 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3090594 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3090595 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3090596 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3090597 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3090598 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3090599 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3090600 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3090601 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3090602 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3090603 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3090604 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3090605 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3090606 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3090607 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3090608 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3090609 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3090610 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3090611 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3090612 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3090613 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3090614 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3090615 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3090616 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3090617 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3090618 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3090619 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3090620 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3090621 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3090622 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3090623 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3090624 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3090625 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3090626 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3090627 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3090628 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3090629 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3090630 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3090631 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3090632 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3090633 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3090634 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3090635 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3090636 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3090637 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3090638 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3090639 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3090640 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3090641 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3090642 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3090643 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3090644 cutting extreme poverty around the world in half by 2015
3090645 so the key to the upcoming election is whether white voters will be more less or equally likely to vote for obama as for kerry i believe the answer is less likely
3090646 just as the american revolution inspired mahatma gandhi to free a great people
3090647 even if you dont like both candidates you should vote for someone because if you dont then you have no business complaining for the next 4 years you did not allow your voice to be heard
3090648 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3090649 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3090650 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3090651 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3090652 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3090653 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3090654 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3090655 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3090656 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3090657 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3090658 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3090659 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3090660 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3090661 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3090662 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3090663 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3090664 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3090665 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3090666 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3090667 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3090668 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3090669 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3090670 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3090671 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3090672 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3090673 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3090674 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3090675 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3090676 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3090677 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3090678 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3090679 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3090680 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3090681 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3090682 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3090683 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
3090684 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
3090685 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
3090686 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
3090687 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
3090688 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3090689 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
3090690 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3090691 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
3090692 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
3090693 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
3090694 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3090695 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
3090696 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
3090697 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
3090698 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3090699 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
3090700 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
3090701 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3090702 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
3090703 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3090704 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3090705 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3090706 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3090707 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3090708 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3090709 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3090710 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3090711 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3090712 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3090713 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3090714 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3090715 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3090716 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3090717 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3090718 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3090719 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3090720 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3090721 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3090722 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3090723 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3090724 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3090725 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3090726 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3090727 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3090728 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3090729 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3090730 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3090731 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
3090732 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
3090733 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
3090734 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3090735 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3090736 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3090737 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3090738 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3090739 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3090740 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3090741 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3090742 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3090743 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3090744 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3090745 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
3090746 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3090747 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3090748 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3090749 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3090750 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3090751 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3090752 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3090753 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3090754 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3090755 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3090756 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3090757 people living in poverty need you and another thing america needs you
3090758 making the eradication of poverty the cause of this generation
3090759 scholarship program he started at an eastern north carolina high school a program he once promised would be a model for the nation under an edwards presidency
3090760 we sent a communication out to upcoming seniors and their parents
3090761 some are saddened that the opportunity is not going to be there for their children but weve had a lot of positive reaction over the years
3090762 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
3090763 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
3090764 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
3090765 even if he makes a marginal improvement with that huge group of voters that could ultimately be very important in certain swing states like my state of virginia where evangelicals comprise a large portion of the voters
3090766 many will either sit on their hands on election day or even if they vote for mccain they wont be out there mobilizing the base and doing the hard work that these folks have done in the past for the republican party
3090767 there are some data that young evangelicals are focusing on a variety of issues not just the social issues but i dont see a voting shift taking place just because younger folks care about the environment doesnt mean thats going to trump their concerns about the life issues
3090768 thats the minimal step he has to take to reduce the animosity against him on abortion
3090769 and if he doesnt do even that hes basically kissing goodbye the chances of making deep inroads in the white evangelical vote
3090770 he has got to come out forcibly and talk about reducing abortions in america he has to forcibly come out and talk about education and abstinence programs
3090771 we evangelicals have to face the fact that when we speak on this issue we in the church do not have enough authority to convince people of that position and have to resort to the coercion of the law
3090772 we have lost our moral authority in this society we havent been able to impact our own community to the extent that we should
3090773 explain to me how you can live with your conscience and sleep at night
3090774 why emulate the failures of american education as opposed to the successes of european education
3090775 they could be if canadian policy makers like you did their jobs correctly
3090776 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3090777 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3090778 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3090779 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3090780 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3090781 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3090782 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3090783 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3090784 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3090785 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3090786 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3090787 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3090788 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3090789 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3090790 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3090791 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
3090792 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
3090793 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
3090794 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
3090795 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
3090796 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
3090797 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
3090798 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3090799 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3090800 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3090801 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3090802 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3090803 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3090804 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3090805 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3090806 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3090807 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3090808 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3090809 tere meie oleme malevast me oleme tallinnast kuidas l heb
3090810 mis sa arvad et ta ise ei n e v i
3090811 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3090812 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3090813 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3090814 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3090815 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3090816 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3090817 these events are all about healthy living and sharing the sense of joy and well being that comes from helping to fund care while sharing foods and wines that are created with the greatest respect for the land and the people who live and work here
3090818 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3090819 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3090820 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3090821 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3090822 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3090823 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3090824 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3090825 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3090826 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3090827 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3090828 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3090829 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3090830 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3090831 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3090832 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3090833 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3090834 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3090835 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3090836 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3090837 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3090838 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3090839 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3090840 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3090841 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3090842 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3090843 tory deh fe tell but long bench nuh deh fe draw
3090844 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
3090845 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
3090846 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
3090847 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
3090848 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future

3090859 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3090860 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3090861 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3090862 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law

3090870 i must be nea but why it seem to take forever
3090871 what a new journey is going to entail for me this time
3090872 boiling everything down is arbitrage they buy low and sell higher presumably after adding some secret technology special sauce since there are tons of these companies right now and they are all offering pretty much the same value proposition the only real lever that they have to compete on is cost and here the cost is totally defined in direct response metrics cost per click cost per action cost per application and so on
3090873 basic free market theory suggests that this will be a run to the bottom each turn of the wheel will net lower and lower gross costs to the network and net costs to the publisher what is more this model totally focuses the agency and eventually the client on dr metrics with no attention paid to the brand given some of the placements that these networks produce campaigns that run through them can often actually devalue the marketer brand but since the focus in not on that end of the paradigm no one is paying attention to it
3090874 the success of the model lies in being able to adapt what youre offering in the shortest time possible to what clients want
3090875 for inditex time is the principal factor to take into account more so than the costs of production

3090897 marston wrote that the number of plants growing on the property indicated to him that the marijuana was not just for personal use and he did some math he wrote that an average plant produces about one pound of processed marijuana and that each pound of marijuana yields about 908 joints if chance smoked one joint every two hours it would take him about four years to smoke all the marijuana on his property marston calculated
3090898 to be what you wish to seem is not only excellent philosophy but also very good advice for spies to pretend to be something youre not is not only impossible but painfully obvious you must put an element of yourself into your persona and you must take elements of that persona into your own heart
3090899 what nanosims brings us is a new tool in our arsenal of weapons
3090900 for the first time we have the ability to get in situ carbon and nitrogen compositions and potentially in situ isotopic compositions of fossil cell walls
3090901 as we go back to older and older rocks the chance of good preservation gets more and more remote
3090902 one very simple basic thing that characterizes all living things is packaging a cell wall or membrane that keeps things in and out cells have to interact with the environment have to metabolize change the chemistry control the osmotic balance and packaging allows this if we see a remnant of a little bit of structure even a fragment of a wall that would give us some confidence that we are looking at biological material
3090903 amino acids and proteins have a lot of nitrogen and cell walls are made of amino acids
3090904 if the nitrogen map looks virtually identical to the carbon map that likely indicates a cell wall or membrane we dont see as much nitrogen in organic carbon that has an abiogenic origin
3090905 the bitter springs is famous for a microbiota containing between 20 and 50 species and it contains all sorts of things with clearly biological morphology such as dividing cells colonies and long filamentous chains of cells
3090906 i had a thin section from the bitter springs formation hanging around and i used it to show what real microfossils would look like
3090907 we can see the cell walls and sheaths and their carbon to nitrogen element ratios
3090908 we are going to start with what we know and step back in time
3090909 is a particularly promising instrument for assessing the biological origin of cell fragments in ancient rocks
3090910 the potential to locate organic remains typical of cellular remnants characterize within them ratios of biochemically important elements and relate such features to the biology and sedimentology of the host rock could provide the type of compelling evidence for early life weve been seeking in the ancient rock record
3090911 if we can demonstrate this works on well known well characterized material that is recognized as biogenic by the geological community we may have another analytical tool to use in assessing the origin of organic matter extraterrestrial samples when we get them
3090912 yeah i rock out and i knit got a problem with that
3090913 its for a two year old its ok for it to be pink
3090914 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3090915 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3090916 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3090917 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3090918 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3090919 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3090954 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
3090955 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
3090956 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
3090957 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
3090958 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially
3090959 those with whom he is negotiating georgias accession to nato
3090960 some powerful weapons through the upgrade of su 25 planes and artillery systems in israel
3090961 claiming that us as well as nato and israeli military assistance to georgia is destabilizing the region
3090962 georgia has received 206 tanks of which 175 units were supplied by nato states 186 armored vehicles 126 from nato 79 guns 67 from nato 25 helicopters 12 from nato 70 mortars ten surface to air missile systems eight israeli made unmanned aircraft and other weapons in addition nato countries have supplied four combat aircraft to georgia the russian defense ministry said there were plans to deliver to georgia 145 armored vehicles 262 guns and mortars 14 combat aircraft including four mirazh 2000 destroyers 25 combat helicopters 15 american black hawk aircraft six surface to air missile systems and other arms

3090973 this landmark research is providing us with greater insight into the genetic markers responsible for improved feedlot health a promising significant breakthrough for the beef industry
3090974 pfizer believes in the opportunity to marry genetics and disease susceptibility to initiate significant improvements in animal health
3090975 this study reinforces the importance of research that will lead to economically relevant management solutions for beef producers
3090976 as an organization one of our goals has been to identify genetic traits related to animal health which is difficult on a large scale industry level
3090977 focusing on animal health we identified brd as one of the obvious diseases on which to focus our efforts we hope the study results will lead to panels of markers indicative of animals less susceptible to brd
3090978 our goal with this study is to maximize producer profitability through healthier animals improved animal welfare and the use of effective genetic management tools
3090979 by identifying key genetic markers the industry can better develop tools for producers to decrease morbidity and mortality resulting in more profits for beef producers throughout the industry
3090980 pfizer believes the colorado state university research will help us in developing new products which can be tailored for certain management protocols that fit the needs of the animal subpopulations in the feedlot
3090981 for example in the future it may be possible to design pharmaceuticals to fit animals based on their genetic predispositions for carcass quality tenderness and susceptibility to common feedlot diseases
3090982 we may find that as we improve animal growth and productivity animals will remain susceptible to certain diseases
3090983 from a protocol standpoint we will be able to recommend different management regimens to treat common feedlot diseases and improve the overall performance based on an animals specific genetic makeup

3091254 theres no way you can defend in particular john edwards lack of honesty with the american public
3091255 i am going to suggest that if the democrats want to continue their fundraising dinner with senator john edwards as the keynote the dinner should be renamed the sex lies and dirty money dinner i dont think that any political party should embrace and endorse the morally bankrupt ideals of lies deceit and extramarital affairs

3091258 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3091259 i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
3091260 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia both sides should allow humanitarian assistance to reach civilians in need russia also must end its cyber war against georgian government websites georgias territorial integrity must be respected as i have said for many months aggressive diplomatic action must be taken to reach a political resolution to this crisis and to assure that georgias sovereignty is protected diplomats at the highest levels from the united states the european union and the united nations must become directly involved in mediating this military conflict and beginning a process to resolve the political disputes over the territories of south ossetia and abkhazia a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately the situation in georgia also requires the deployment of genuine international peacekeeping forces in south ossetia and abkhazia the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate russia cannot play a constructive role as peacekeeper instead russian actions in both south ossetia and abkhazia appear to be intended to preserve an unstable status quo
3091261 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia

3091350 wenn man den bayern mit ganz viel herz und leidenschaft zusetzt haben sie probleme ich denke das haben wir in dem spiel mehr als deutlich gemacht

3091355 different business terms expectations in that sector and more importantly generally prevailing pricing of pc digital games versus their console counterparts

3091358 he played outstandingly well and shocked the samoans he used his speed well and he blended in completely with the other players timoci stood his ground and outran the bulky samoan forwards with ease he is a player who has the capacity to go far at the highest level
3091359 nagusa blew us away and left many of our players gasping for breath
3091360 timoci has the one major asset i have been searching the rugby union and league world for
3091361 his personality and attitude will fit into the ulster culture we are creating i have been very selective in waiting for the right person for this position in our playing roster i am glad we waited for timoci to sign with us
3091362 before i signed i was in contact with matt williams a number of times that was very reassuring he is a real professional and really knows what he is talking about i have been up to ravenhill a couple of times for a look i hear the fans are very passionate and enjoy their rugby so i am really looking forward to first home game of season against bath which will be terrific i am really excited about that
3091363 i am still very young playing alongside luke watson and schalk burger at the stormers has been an incredible experience and i have learnt loads from them but it doesnt mean i cant learn a lot more here i have heard such a great things about ulster rugby and there is such a great vibe in the squad they have both given such positive feedback so it was an easy decision to move here
3091364 i am really looking forward to a new challenge obviously carlo is an international player now and ryan is a future international so it will be a real challenge to break into the squad
3091365 it took a lot of thought to move to ulster and there were some days when i thought i maybe hadnt made the right decision but now that i am back and training with the boys i like the way things are going everyone hears the stories of last year where we werent as good as we should have been but i think now everyone has good things to say and is very positive matt is very organised so as long as we get off to a good start we should be okay

3091367 we look forward to continuing our relationship with the university at albany and the city of albany

3091377 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register
3091378 i love the smaller campus and the closeness of our soccer team i also like how ive had the opportunity to become as intern as a freshman not every college has that our faculty here at tech is one of a kind and dont just strive to be teachers but they also become friends and that is really impressive for a university
3091379 indiana tech is a smaller campus so you really get to know everyone what they like any activities they are involved in etc these connections and establishing personal professional friendships is what i appreciate the most about indiana tech the high speed internet is a
3091380 i really enjoy the personal attention that any and all of the professors are willing to spend with students even if that professor isnt teaching the class also that most of the professors have real world experience and they are willing to help with your career as well as class work
3091381 i love tech i am going to tell you in all honesty i didnt really want to come here but i got a great volleyball opportunity and took it however once i got here i realized it was a great choice i do not regret my decision

3091384 for a little bit of context the radical and nationalist parties of serbia had individually been holding relatively small scale protests all week against the imprisonment of radovan karadzic on monday the 20th
3091385 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3091386 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3091387 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy
3091388 id like to think ive made some people pause reflect and reconsider ideas and assumptions they held as true but it would be naive to think that everyone who clicked on to the page now thinks differently

3091390 if it resulted in a smile to a stranger or a knock introducing yourself to your neighbor then id be very proud
3091391 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3091392 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3091393 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3091394 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3091395 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
3091396 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
3091397 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes

3091399 the blackberry bold is a breakthrough smartphone for both professional and personal use

3091401 the blackberry bold smartphone perfectly combines state of the art communications and multimedia functionality attractive design high speed internet access and an intuitive user experience making it the perfect smartphone solution
3091402 rim is no longer a mobile office e mail player it has evolved into a deeply embedded enterprise vendor and we continue to push this as the key differentiator
3091403 so while apple nokia motorola and now htc corp continue to compete on enterprise hardware designs they cannot stack up to rim in terms of the enterprise ecosystems rim has in place
3091404 this remains a crucial difference that will make competition here almost meaningless
3091405 the battle for higher end consumers has escalated significantly the next iphone will boast 3g and may get out the door before the bold but it will be quite interesting to see how the bold does as a prosumer device
3091406 our view remains that rim and apple are market complementary and that each will continue to find its own set of users

3091439 the party does not check the property or the past of its donors how they manage their finances is none of our business
3091440 there is a lot of suspicion around who is really financing the hzds and whether they are legal or illegal sources
3091441 the partys treasurer brought the money to party headquarters together with a notarised donation contract
3091442 there is also the risk that these firms finances will be used to support chosen political parties
3091443 the debt is being repaid in accordance with an instalment plan
3091444 in slovakia control is very formal and in fact finds only such flaws
3091445 it does not investigate any evidence that could suggest unfair financing of political parties
3091446 from what resources is the alliance financed and whose interests does it represent
3091447 we publish all our sponsors and subsidies on the internet
3091448 take the european socialists for example they speak nobly and are always dressed decently and smartly but what about the policy they push it is far from socialist

3091455 the tours have enabled those interested in the history of their town to gradually discover the secrets of places they thought they knew
3091456 much to our pleasure some people become so intrigued by something theyve learned they begin attending history lectures or reading literature and then return to share their new knowledge
3091457 the guides are amusing and engaging so the informations not hard to digest
3091458 they dont burden the audience with unnecessary and tedious details
3091459 genuine tourists rational local patriots and future guides in ko ice as well as those who would like to know as much as they do
3091460 it is more beautiful and optimistic to look up rather than down while you walk through the city then you wont miss the architecture that astonishing art that adds soul to the space that most closely surrounds us
3091461 within 60 minutes one can easily walk across the whole centre of ko ice
3091462 furthermore there are plenty of monuments and places to visit this is shown by the fact that we have done almost 50 tours so far and there are still enough topics for the next two years
3091463 it is neither too big nor too small and this actually applies to all of slovakia
3091464 our cultural heritage is comparable with other countries the only difference is that we didnt have a homer who ensured us a lifetime of publicity

3091467 from the tectonic point of view slovakia is a buffer zone between the african and euro asian plate the african continent keeps moving northwards
3091468 take the european socialists for example they speak nobly and are always dressed decently and smartly but what about the policy they push it is far from socialist
3091469 still moodys expects the upcoming adoption of the euro to be a net positive for slovakia

3091472 at the same time the opportunity for private companies to achieve better ratings will improve as well
3091473 investors could in the near future look at the economies of the v4 region without slovakia which means that the central and east european region will in the eyes of the investors include the czech republic poland and hungary who will obviously be joined by romania and bulgaria after a certain time

3091475 rating agencies will carefully watch the development and management of public finances and their impact on inflation

3091518 y nadie sabe cu nto ha invertido el consell en dependencia en nuestra ciudad
3091519 es una l stima que el consell de camps olvide una vez m s castell n y s lo tenga inversiones en valencia y para los denominados grandes proyectos
3091520 vamos a estar constantemente exigiendo las inversiones sociales que nos tocan a los ciudadanos y ciudadanas de la capital de la plana

3091533 pennsylvania is basically a democrat leaning state a democrat really needs to have it if a republican wins it i think it is very likely that the republican wins the election nationally
3091534 a state that leans democrat in a climate in which the republican brand name is at a significant disadvantage
3091535 no doubt that pennsylvania is the only big state in the northeast that is still open to a republican
3091536 still my sense is that pennsylvania could only generously be called a toss up right now i think more correctly it is very light blue leaning to obama
3091537 obama will have to fall flat for pennsylvania to go republican in 2008 the african american vote is going to be way up and 95 97 percent for obama it will be tough for mccain to make up enough ground in the philly ring counties or the more rural parts of the state in the west but well see
3091538 ridge might just be able to deliver the state to mccain though it wouldnt be a slam dunk even then
3091539 most observers dont think ridge is going to be picked because of his pro choice position but with mccain the maverick you never really know
3091540 i expect both candidates to be spending a lot of time in pennsylvania this fall
3091541 this state is going to be critical because of the number of electoral votes at stake
3091542 its going to take a lot of hard work and commitment but senator obama has shown hes prepared to do that

3091547 the same casinos that put me up in 2 000 a night rooms were now having me arrested for eating out of their dumpster
3091548 some were fools through their sinful ways they loathed any kind of food and they drew near to the gates of death then they cried to the lord in their trouble and he delivered them from their distress
3091549 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough
3091550 grave concern about this young man being held and beaten i think if youre holding him and allowing someone else to beat him youre a part of this process

3091560 nobody can walk down the street and be safe that is be free from police interference
3091561 they know exactly whos doing the shooting the robbery but it seems like were never going to get any justice around here

3091725 how did we get proofs to clients before planes trains and automobiles analyzing the print workflow we realized that the carbon footprint for transportation and delivery of proofs involves a significantly larger carbon footprint than the distribution of the final materials
3091726 by this time next year all three of our divisions will run the insite system
3091727 by using the new workflow system to reduce the number of days we used to spend shipping proofs to and from customers insync has been able to reduce the production time of the average project by as much as 20 percent
3091728 the insite system also eliminated hundreds of thousands of dollars our customers spent on shipping expenses
3091729 we had significant cost justification for moving to the magnus 800 platesetter
3091730 we went from three output devices that had to be operated manually to one digital device this allows us to bring in more work and move it through more quickly the magnus 800 platesetter also uses a third of the power that three separate devices required reducing our energy costs and consumption

3091759 with a little dns spoofing i fed my own list into the iphone and effectively killed by name applications that attempt to use the gps it looks like thats all its set to do right now but i may just not have found the vaporize switch
3091760 either it is an anti malware solution and the iphone has a switch somewhere to vaporize any app or its not an anti malware solution and is really designed to kill applications that interfere with apples business model such as unsanctioned traffic navigation software
3091761 unless for some reason they decided to build two separate mechanisms into the iphone to do this of which the other one is invisible this one likely feeds a master kill switch perhaps there is a special setting in the configuration file which can vaporize the app all together
3091762 you should never have been in that situation to begin with and again brings up the question is the iphone really an enterprise device
3091763 on the other hand how did the i am rich app get through

3091769 the significance of this ships commissioning in new york is immense particularly given the impact on our community downtown as well as on all new yorkers when the uss new york makes her entrance into new york harbor with that special steel forged into her bow she will be in a sense coming home as an important symbol of both strength and remembrance our goal on the commissioning committee is to make sure that when the ship and her crew depart after a week long welcome and the commissioning ceremony that she will carry not just that special steel but also the spirit of new york and new yorkers with her
3091770 the u s navy and marine corps are fortunate to have john thain head up the talented men and women of the all volunteer uss new york commissioning committee

3091787 my familys been in johnston county since the 1700s and im the only one who hasnt been a farmer
3091788 i was among the first generation not to do farming at all when i turned 50 i decided i was going to do it
3091789 i wanted my children to understand the experience of farming and understand the cycle of life
3091790 were being very careful about the branding of falcons park because we want quality we dont want to go cheap and then have a bad brand in the beginning when we started we thought we were at the top we didnt know any better so now we really think that we are and obviously we are if were competing nationally
3091791 its not an overnight process getting something like this done
3091792 it has been a process of learning but if you start something from scratch you have to try a few things before you can find something that you feel is going to work weve got a lot of hope that this is going to work
3091793 this whole experience has really brought me into a reality check with what farmers have had to face and why all of these family farms are gone now
3091794 its real these people didnt just make a choice it was made for them when the tobacco cash crop was gone nothing else was there
3091795 but to find a market and find a product and match it up is going to be a challenge
3091796 ive had times when ive felt like giving up but you just cant
3091797 i think if we can get to a point and find our niche that we will see things start progressing i think its going to come from multiple avenues i dont like being out of my area of expertise though i like my comfort zone if it werent for the real goal the higher goal of wanting to contribute back to north carolina and back to the farming industry and for the fact that i really firmly believe that farming needs to stay then im not sure i would be doing this
3091798 i dont think that my kids or grandkids can understand our history and their place in it without experiencing the real organic understanding of life
3091799 it just doesnt seem right that an american tradition such as farming could just slip away like that im trying to make sure that it doesnt

3092586 i was tandem nursing my two year old son and my newborn when a mother in my church community adopted a very ill newborn he had multiple surgeries to heal his damaged heart and bowell and when released from the hospital was not doing well on formula a woman in our congregation convinced his mother to let some of us breastfeed him to supplement his formula feeds five mothers helped breastfeed him for a few weeks while he recovered from surgery he had a big turnaround with his health and lived two more happy years before he died at the age of two from his heart condition this was a very sweet experience for all of us nobody pumped we just latched him on and he nursed like a pro i also tried to nurse my best friends baby once when i was tending him and he used his two new little baby teeth to bite me so hard i bled
3092587 i think that its just not been our social norm
3092588 in some cultures it is and you would think nothing of you know nursing your neighbors child if something happened or nursing your sisters baby if she has to go to work
3092589 cross nursing is the logical extension to the rise in breast feeding rates that weve seen in the past 15 years
3092590 moms are really committed to breast feeding exclusively and finding new ways to do that cross feeding cross nursing is one of those
3092591 they assume that anything that is to do with breasts has to be sexual
3092592 so its i guess bad enough if youre doing it with your own child but then you add another child to the mix and theyre really concerned about it its silly
3092593 i think that a move back towards cross nursing or even just getting together with your nursing babies and sharing stories and becoming comfortable talking about the topic meets a very primal need for us that sense of bonding in the community

3092605 i knew what nicholas was like he was vile and was always a pain he had gang connections right from the beginning but i loved him even if unreasonable for jesus had compassion on him
3092606 if god has called me to be here why arent people responding
3092607 soaking herself in scripture and prayer and being drenched by the holy spirit
3092608 the church member resented nicholas because like chan wo sai he was such a bad influence in the school of course they knew about the bargirl sister and that the father was a hopeless opium addict in their eyes the fact that i was welcoming nicholas to our club meant that the christian church got a bad name i should not even be seen with him i knew what nicholas was like he was vile and was always a pain he had triad gang connections right from the beginning and later graduated to becoming a heroin addict and necessarily a pusher but i loved him even if unreasonable for jesus had come into the world for him which too was unreasonable
3092609 one of our regular attendees at the youth club was christopher he lived in on e smelly loft sleeping in two bunk beds with six brothers and sisters plus the two parents the chickens lived below the rest of the room was taken up with huge piles of plastic objects which christophers mother assembled she earned one hong kong dollar for this all the children had to help her assemble these parts as soon as they were three or four his sister ah lin could not attend primary school and was put to work in a factory as soon as she was 13 she was badly paid for the sweated labour she did but every dollar and cent she earned had to be given to her mother she was not allowed to keep anything for herself when exhausted by a ten or twelve hour day and a crowded bus journey as she eventually returned home she had as many as four more hours of work ahead of her sewing on sequins one sweater would take her up to a week to complete when finished it would bring another three hong kong dollars in wages all of which would be kept by her mother ah lin finally rebelled as such exploitation she met a boy at her factory who liked her but her mother forbade her to go out with him she was not allowed to come to our youth club either as her brother did because the programme was mostly recreational had we provided sewing lessons or english classes it would have bee permitted but enjoyment pure and simple was to be no part of her life instead the girls task was to stay at home and look after the babies or assemble plastic parts or carry water eventually the drudgery was too much ah lin left home aged fourteen and went to live with the boy her mother recaptured her and locked her up at home saying she was a bad girl she was beaten for what she had done her action had not only brought shame on the family it was also an attack on the family earnings her mother continued to refuse to let her go anywhere outside the home treated like chattels it was not surprising many girls made the jump into prostitution rather than remain imprisoned at home

3092640 fortunately people often say yes or agree with requests out of mindless compliance

3092644 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex
3092645 when it comes to video games parents should know that what they play is a resource that helps demystify one of the most popular and challenging forms of entertainment their kids are into
3092646 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3092647 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk

3092664 having to deal with this event has been hard for her
3092665 she has shown incredible strength in the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it and there have been a lot of tears and hugs the fact that shes able to get in amongst it and already be able to address what happened is a testament to her strength of character

3092672 its carbon footprint isnt as good as totally non carbon fuels but as we transition to alternative fuels there could be a pathway to a future that includes natural gas for while
3092673 if someone can make a business out of it thats great the public benefits are rather small so i dont think our government should put much effort into promoting it
3092674 if we started moving to natural gas vehicles in large numbers even if we didnt go to renewables wed have plenty of natural gas

3092686 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3092687 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy
3092688 be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3092689 the court is not unsympathetic to tiffany and other rights owners it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark and companies like ebay cannot be held liable for trademark infringement based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their websites
3092690 we do not believe the law allows auction sites like ebay to continue to turn a blind eye to this problem while reaping profits from the listing and sale of counterfeit merchandise
3092691 stated trademark law does not impose a duty on tiffany to police ebays site ebay designed the site and has the responsibility to police it

3092702 they try to add a whole bunch of other evidence and try to make a decision about authentication

3092722 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men

3092779 there is a desperate need for the leadership of the church to smarten up to gender related issues like violence and issues of power and control
3092780 gender inequality is one of the key drivers of the pandemic the church is in a key position to transform attitudes within the community it cannot remain silent
3092781 it was the church that stood on the front line against slavery and against apartheid
3092782 the church is the hope of the world and gods plan for dealing with the problems of the world
3092783 whether dealing with violence poverty orphans or aids if we dont start with the church we are starting at the wrong end of the equation
3092784 the original vision at the heart of shared worlds has always been the desire to provide a place where oddball kids like me could get together and play with ideas

3092832 i am writing this to express true concern for both the mountain my family and i love so much as well as for our local economy which we at the bend chamber are so dedicated to enhancing over the recent holiday season i witnessed inexcusable mayhem and confusion at the ski area
3092833 thank you powder corp sic for taking the most beautiful landmark in our city and turning it into a mountain of hate
3092834 the opportunity to come to bachelor came out of the blue
3092835 i was perfectly happy at killington where the challenge was to implement a new business model that would result in renewed capital investment after 11 years of limited capital under asc
3092836 we eliminated many comp and greatly discounted lift tickets and the asc multi resort season pass went away chris nyberg and the entire killington management team believed we could get to the point this coming season when the focus on quality would begin to pay dividends i was looking forward to continuing to help chris move killington and pico in the right direction
3092837 but based on the mountain the quality of life in central oregon and the fact that i enjoy a challenge
3092838 made coming to mt bachelor a good choice for my family and me at this time
3092839 new leadership was deemed necessary to move forward in a positive manner at mt bachelor my skill set fits well with the challenge ahead
3092840 reconnect with the local community though events focus groups and becoming a better partner
3092841 bachelor has a great track record but has missed opportunities to communicate it
3092842 it can be a bluebird day at the base but the summit express is closed on top due to high winds 100 mph gusts are not uncommon as storms clear out guests see the top chair is not running and cant understand why since conditions are less severe in the base areas protected from the prevailing winds we need to educate guests and communicate the conditions better tell them whats going on through signage web cams and perhaps an anemometer tied to a mobile real time communications system
3092843 my role is to get mt bachelor back on track we need to get this house in order there is a perception we are not delivering a quality experience were going to fix this first were going to make sure our delivery process is defined were going to communicate it we will be approachable and transparent about how and why we do things
3092844 everyone has been very receptive to me and they seem to be optimistic that things can and will change now
3092845 i continue to forge ahead with cautious optimism but i have much more confidence after lunch than i did before hand
3092846 i asked him many specific questions and i liked his responses
3092847 my first priority was to tactfully ensure that he has a true sense of the situation up at the mountain which i am now confident that he does
3092848 he is a no nonsense kind of guy with a great deal of experience he realizes the proof is in the pudding and how much mt bachelor affects the local economy of central oregon we are here to support dave to help facilitate positive changes
3092849 the challenges that mt bachelor has faced have been well documented and openly recognized by dave as well as powdr corp management we are very fortunate to have a respected leader like dave addressing those challenges
3092850 mt bachelors success is critical to the health of bends winter tourism industry visit bend and the bend tourism community stand behind dave and we are excited to help him make the changes that need to be made to solidify mt bachelors rightful position as the premier ski resort in the pacific northwest

3092856 the journey of illness is often defined by the many losses one goes through and the grief of seeing their dreams disappear many people however eventually find a fresh passion that they could not have imagined they would have ever taken the time to discover before they were diagnosed with an illness
3092857 my plans had always been to work for a nonprofit where i could help other people but i was unable to relate to them they way i wanted to since i had not walked in their shoes
3092858 now my passion to write and speak and share where i find my strength which is through the lord has given me a purpose i never could have imagined otherwise
3092859 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3092860 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3092861 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy
3092862 attack took about half of the day i e a bit less than 10 hours
3092863 so if you have a gige lan any trojaned machine can poison your dns during one night
3092864 while i think its bad that anybody who can hammer you at gige speed for ten hours can poison your cache its not a threat to the real world the way 11 seconds at 10 megabit was
3092865 any dns server with a host based firewall can implement a 100 effective mitigation for the polyakov attack and its possible that an upstream outboard firewall could also be made to do it
3092866 at some point isc will have to put logic like this into bind of course but protecting against the polyakov attack is like synflood protection in that its a rate limit problem
3092867 its long past time for secure dns which is a combination of tsig tkey sig 0 and dnssec end to end crypto authentication
3092868 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

3092871 the whole range of the mountain pine beetle from mexico to canada is under outbreak
3092872 british columbia is undergoing the biggest outbreak to date in any part of the mountain beetle range since the 1990s the area affected is now roughly 36 million acres about the size of nepal or one and a half times as big as maine or indiana
3092873 our predictions are that at the end of this outbreak which will last another four to six years we expect to lose 80 percent of our mature pine in british columbia
3092874 it really hasnt affected winter operations it has affected maintenance in summer mainly in the form of cutting down trees
3092875 if they hadnt done that logging those trees would have died or be dying
3092876 what were doing now is logging these areas doing regeneration cuts we remove all mature lodgepole pine that are either dead or going to die and leave younger trees standing
3092877 we dont have to plant or seed these areas the trees will start to regenerate on their own hopefully in two or three years
3092878 tree islands are very important for skiing they protect trails from wind and they delineate trails
3092879 its costing us 1 500 to 2 000 an acre to do regeneration cutting
3092880 mountain pine beetles get epidemic from time to time and this is one of those times their impacts are quite large right now including impacts at ski areas were not going to stop these epidemics but were going to try and protect some property and peoples homes and some resources in highly prioritized places where its really important and ski areas are among those places
3092881 theyre endemic that is theyre always there but theyre at a real low level this particular epidemic will burn itself out over the next couple years but well have over a longer period other areas where the beetles will become epidemic they cant stay epidemic very long in one particular area
3092882 lodgepole pine is a big forest type and a host preference for mountain pine beetles
3092883 fire and bark beetles sort of work hand in hand bark beetles come into an area increase the fuel loading with flammable dead trees with needles then lightning strikes you get fires some are suppressed and some arent the system regenerates itself for the next forest through this combination of forces
3092884 warming temps are probably playing a role although wed probably be in this mode with or without warming temps
3092885 if you get two weeks of minus 30 degree temperatures in winter that can work to control the beetles and we havent had those temperatures recently
3092886 this comes in several forms fire suppression causing forest to age unnaturally and at the same time climate change as warming has increased the area available to pine beetles the area affected by this outbreak is 10 times bigger than the area impacted previously
3092887 from an economic standpoint the mountain pine beetle has created a short term boom through an effort to extract some value from the dead trees before they rot then the slump in the u s housing market put the kibosh on all that so now we have sawmills closing quite regularly since the market for wood products isnt there
3092888 there is also an increased risk of catastrophic wild fires 2003 was quite a bad year for us but most didnt happen in areas affected by the mountain pine beetle the longer we go without one of these fires the lower the potential for one of them becomes because trees shed needles and fine twigs from the crowns
3092889 there are other ecological impacts on watersheds without intact forest cover alberta is trying to control mountain pine beetles to avoid some of the problems were having alberta saskatchewan and manitoba all depend on the southern slopes of the rockies for their water theres also a hydrology issue around fisheries as well
3092890 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3092891 i think we look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies

3092894 the younger generations of modern orthodox jews are seeking new meaning to their religious expression going beyond survival and anti assimilation and just text study
3092895 there have been countless individuals who have felt estranged from the orthodox community who have been in touch with us were getting hundreds of e mails saying that this has filled a gap
3092896 although norway produced the expected strong performance and had the americans on the verge of defeat europe lost its dominance in womens football the current world champions norway were the only team to come up to expectation and win a medal
3092897 the quality of football on display was also of a very high standard and the outcome a major surprise despite chinas elimination in the first round it was sun wen who finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals germany came in third after beating brazil in the play off and also won the fair play trophy
3092898 womens football heavyweights usa looked out for the count on more than one occasion but coach april heinrichs experienced team came back off the ropes to beat brazil 2 1 after extra time and add a second olympic title to the gold medal won at the 1996 games in atlanta the americans struggled for long periods in the final and saw the woodwork come to their rescue twice as the aggressive and mobile south americans now unquestionably one of the worlds top teams piled on the pressure only for the usa to cheat the hangmans noose once again
3092899 mexico nigeria japan and australia have all taken great strides although the greek hosts lack of experience made them cannon fodder for the big guns world champions germany finished with bronze after a 1 0 victory in the third place play off against sweden but there will be much wringing of hands in the chinese camp after a feeble first round exit
3092900 the 2004 womens olympic football tournament marked an end to the former clearly defined hierarchy once and for all
3092901 if you count the relatives and close friends of active participants in football who share in their passion for the game as fans and support them in other ways the total number is even more impressive well over a billion people worldwide are involved in football at all levels of society and across all borders
3092902 germanys progress to the global summit of the womens game was as impressive as it was inexorable the reigning european champions did not concede a single goal on their way to defending the games top prize at the fifa womens world cup china 2007
3092903 future development depends on giving players a steeper learning curve in terms of top level matches
3092904 an interesting development in norway where for the first time a womens premier league klepp has built its own stadium and it seems likely that other teams will follow suit
3092905 the ultimate objective is to develop an elite sport structure and culture and in the longer term to perform at the international level with our
3092906 we have gotten better since previous tournaments and we are here to try and show that we can play football and compete with the other countries
3092907 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3092908 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3092909 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3092910 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3092911 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3092912 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3092913 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3092914 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3092915 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3092916 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3092917 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3092918 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3092919 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3092920 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3092921 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3092922 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3092923 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3092924 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3092925 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3092926 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3092928 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3092929 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3092930 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3092931 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3092932 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3092933 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3092934 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3092935 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3092936 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3092937 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3092938 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3092939 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3092940 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3092941 it took us awhile to finally get to this first game and for it to be against china it made it that much better the anticipation for this game was an all time high we were happy that we were able to play well and get a win
3092942 they pass the ball well theyre going to give us a good run
3092943 there is no doubt that there has been a slowdown in the purchasing of ski property for the first half of this year but we are also in the height of summer typically when a slowdown occurs come september we hope the mood will shift towards a more positive latter half of 08
3092944 the old adage of location location location will be more important than ever now so altitude and high quality and high occupancy will be key sanderson said
3092945 already popular established resorts will remain popular such as the chamonix valley vallorcine in particular in france where great infrastructural investment is been channeled the same is true for meribel les arcs serre chevalier val disere and tignes
3092946 additionally projects which are adjusting their pricing in response to market demand are attracting buyers attention
3092947 at the refuge du golf in flaine the developer is offering a 10 percent reduction in the asking price plus a vat rebate of 19 6 percent as well as a guaranteed rental yield of 5 percent and two free weeks personal usage
3092948 where the mortgage market has frozen in the u k banks in france and switzerland are offering some decent mortgage deals though they tend to be changing fairly frequently so we advise clients to seek advice from reliable sources and independent financial advisors
3092949 its not like a wholesale thing but there is a definite sea change because there is trouble at home people are saying what can we get rid of clearly not buying overseas and selling your overseas property is going to be one of the first ports of call
3092950 personally i think that sales of detached chalets or quality apartments in top resorts such as courchevel and val disere will not be affected
3092951 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3092952 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3092953 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3092954 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3092955 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3092956 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3092957 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3092958 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3092959 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3092960 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3092961 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3092962 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3092963 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3092964 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3092965 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3092966 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3092967 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3092968 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3092969 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3092970 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3092971 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3092972 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3092973 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3092974 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3092975 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3092976 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3092977 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3092978 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3092979 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3092980 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3092981 who are open to doing something on the production side
3092982 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3092983 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3092984 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3092985 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3092986 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3092987 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3092988 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3092989 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3092990 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3092991 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3092992 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3092993 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3092994 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3092995 sue the flaming fucking pants off of alexa and its bleary eyed master bezos

3093019 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
3093020 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
3093021 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
3093022 were definitely seeing the strength in the 1 million and above range and below 600 000 its all cash buyers above 1 million and below 600 000 its cash or a reasonable loan
3093023 high net worth individuals are not impacted as heavily as middle income individuals in the u s right now and were seeing the effect of that
3093024 around lake tahoe our volume year to date is off of last year which was off of the year before the number of sales is off but our prices arent dropping like they are nationally were tending to hold our value except in certain pockets and certain types of properties
3093025 residences are holding value things that have slipped are condo complexes where theres a lot of competition resorts are in high demand its what baby boomers have been working all their life for and theres only so much of it
3093026 this fractional product is a great option for people because its not as much of a financial commitment 200 000 to 500 000 compared with 3 to 8 million for whole ownership our market is not completely recession proof but it tends to be
3093027 slowdown in the market and a fair amount of inventory on the market whether in re sales or new projects that have come on line in this area
3093028 theres a little bit less impact up here than were seeing in the san francisco bay and sacramento areas and very high end stuff does seem to be moving
3093029 were partners with east west development in the village at northstar we had the land and they took the risk and built the real estate we bought back the commercial 150 000 square feet of space in the village and were 97 percent rented
3093030 martis camp is probably the most exclusive development in our area so far
3093031 these sales activities are unprecedented over the last 22 months in this area regionally and beyond they have defied what the market has seen in terms of land sales nobodys selling that kind of volume over that period of time
3093032 why the unique layout clearly identifies with what people are looking for in the tahoe community the expansiveness and multigenerational aspect of the membership has been a huge draw combined with two macro aspects the tom fazio golf course and direct ski connection with northstar
3093033 we will see our prices retreat a little bit from the highs but were a unique market and there is a very finite amount of new growth that can occur demand outstrips supply and as a result we tend to hold prices
3093034 we decided our girl was on her last legs last summer we did the foundation work and were finishing the project this summer all five towers are standing and well start to pull cable in the next month
3093035 thats precipitated development and redevelopment here in teton village teton county is 97 percent government controlled and managed land only the remaining three percent is developable its simple supply and demand
3093036 there are fewer and fewer places for people to buy and build on and thats a large part of whats driving demand and some of the costs youre seeing
3093037 demand is really strong on the lower end under 1 million because believe it or not thats almost affordable
3093038 certainly its gotten slower but at least were still selling units and thats a big plus in this economy
3093039 we just broke ground on phase 2 we feel pretty comfortable theres enough demand theres only so many units that are going to be built and thats it were not looking at a vail or a tahoe or a tremblant where you have thousands of properties we have very few
3093040 from a supply and demand perspective people are realizing that being a true luxury project in new england bodes well for us would i love to have the sales pace where it was a year and a half ago sure but knowing whats going on in the country we continue to move forward
3093041 we have sold all of our completed mountain cabins 2 5 million to 3 million apiece and have two under construction right now

3093048 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3093049 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3093052 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3093053 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

3093061 i remember discussing the issue of peak oil when i was an engineering student in college 32 years ago
3093062 king hubbard whose books i studied accurately predicted that united states oil production would peak by 1970
3093063 we all assumed the country would have developed plenty of alternatives over the years so there was no need to really worry obviously that hasnt happened and now were about 70 percent dependent on other countries
3093064 i think well be seeing trends change since midwest resorts are relatively close by in terms of driving distance and as airline prices continue to rise along with the hassles that now come with air travel increase
3093065 weve got to be careful with peoples pocketbooks right now conservative should be our watchword in that regard
3093066 nobody know what the rules are yet for calculating the costs and we may not know until we write the check were working to get it all simplified but it could be anywhere from a 100 to 200 percent increase
3093067 we certainly dont object to anything that makes it safer but the ironic thing here is the snowmobile involved in this sad accident was only going 8 mph
3093068 the proposed legislation really would make it difficult for example to get to accident scenes
3093069 almost impossible to operate a snowmobile on a ski slope

3093074 i decided that coaching was what id like to pursue and continued at iowa for a period of time until i was given the opportunity to work with steve gladstone and geoff bond at the university of california i was able to learn from the womens coaches dave oneill and sara nevin as well it was very exciting and educational to work with that program it was a unique time to be there with the men and women both having such success i decided to pursue coaching womens rowing and i am very grateful to coach leeanne crain for giving me that opportunity
3093075 i was pretty bored with school and was looking for something to help keep me interested a friend of mine was at the university of nebraska and was with the club team there i figured i would give it a shot and i have been involved ever since
3093076 coach crain and the outstanding reputation of ou athletics and vice president for intercollegiate athletics joe castiglione
3093077 having grown up in the midwest oklahoma is very familiar to me i really have enjoyed norman and i am impressed at how genuine and friendly people have been
3093078 absolutely in fact i would say it already has when my previous team was competing at the head of the oklahoma i spoke with some people with no knowledge of rowing but were there for the oklahoma centennial celebration and wanted to see what rowing was all about what is happening in oklahoma city and the rest of the country will only increase interest in the sport and raise the level of competition
3093079 it is a sport that you can learn in a relatively short period of time it can be done individually or with a team and if you wish to pursue the sport you can spend a lifetime and still be working to improve your ability
3093080 there are a lot of possible ways to answer this being an assistant coach for a team that won repeated conference and national championships is certainly a great experience but helping student athletes grow and develop as leaders is probably the most rewarding part of the whole coaching experience
3093081 all sports any sport will hold my attention for some period of time i also enjoy swimming and watching water polo soccer softball and baseball are also fun to watch i spent a year in brazil in high school as an exchange student i say i learned how to play soccer but my skill level is minimal i enjoy bicycling hiking running and watching nascar i could just keep listing for a while

3093143 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3093144 our investigations focus is shifting to the next group of market participants
3093145 we are meeting with regulators monday in jefferson city missouri and look forward to the discussions
3093146 what about all those americans driving around in iraq and afghanistan in open humvees
3093147 making this team is up to me and how well i play
3093148 i need to perform really well in all the preseason games and show the coaching staff that i am the type of player who can contribute
3093149 i gotta go to work every day and improve every day
3093150 if im not getting better at certain things its really not good for me and a waste of time for me its hard to keep that focus knowing that every day you have to do something better if you slip its hard to get that rope back i think that if i can keep working on the things i need to work on i can be a contributor
3093151 brad is another all around guy we played him at fullback we played him as a backup tight end hes smart and he can kind of do it all so that increases his value because he can do more things and so i think special teams will impact him as well so well give him an opportunity on special teams
3093152 we are expecting our guests to become more creative with how they travel to and from the resorts meaning more people in individual vehicles and guests more likely to stay overnight and get two to three days of skiing rather than doing two to three one day trips
3093153 its very much the same way people may go to the supermarket fewer times but buy more when they go there we always are open to gas oriented promotions and have done them in the past
3093154 things are rolling along nicely here not many americans though that is a little disappointing we have seen a big drop in numbers compared to previous years it seems like we have been hit with a multitude of different scenarios gas prices dollar value weather competition etc it just does not seem to end
3093155 just when it was thought that things couldnt get any worse the 1972 73 winter season was practically snowless the economy was in a downturn and two years earlier vermonts pioneering environmental legislation act 250 made its debut june 1973 brought severe flooding that resulted in heavy damage to okemos infrastructure
3093156 berkshire east has its own service station to assure you of a supply of gasoline for your trip home

3093158 when you close the doors you can count on the fact that no ones going to give you a dollar we stay open because theres still skiing and its our business were about going skiing
3093159 you look around in the middle of june at resorts above 7 000 feet and wonder how they can possibly open for mountain biking and hiking when theres still snow everywhere it makes sense to keep skiing when you cant use the resort for summer purposes just yet
3093160 we close because people stop skiing we lose our destination skiers and it is not cost effective to run a business
3093161 sure economics have to factor in to some respect it costs money gas electricity etc to maintain the snowpack or it gets rotten and disappears but 50 60 000 in revenue is good because its revenue its just worth it
3093162 the marketing folks and ceo are loading lifts and serving food
3093163 we gather up the year round staff and head towards whatevers open we keep the seasonal ski patrol its no less safe out there and we have training programs for everyone
3093164 you factor in whos coming through your door we have guys that drive all night ski one day and head home or sleep in parking lots theyre beating our door down to ski until the last flake falls
3093165 season ticket holders know when conditions are good or when weve run out of snow
3093166 weve created this expectation that we will have skiing as long as we can those who like to ski the rabid skiers will take it whenever you give it to them
3093167 no ski resort is making a ton of money by offering skiing in may but it creates great guest retention if everyone in utah stayed open until may it wouldnt pencil out for us
3093168 i saw a guy screech into the parking lot grab his board and run wildly to the hill trying to get a couple of trams in before 3 p m thats the guy youre doing it for
3093169 you come to a point when you question what you get when you keep pushing snow but there are no trails to ski
3093170 we open when we have enough and will stay open until its too hard to keep chair one open
3093171 i am very surprised that a ballot measure ended up with over 42 percent of its signatures being invalid
3093172 that is among the largest overall invalid rates that i can recall ever seeing from a citizens initiative drive
3093173 the verifying process of checking millions of petition signatures is something my office took very seriously in compliance with the arizona revised statutes
3093174 in the end it seems to me weve seen too many problems and abuses with the gathering of petitions and perhaps this is now a lesson that its time to reform the overall petition gathering system as i had proposed over the last few years
3093175 paying circulators by the signature invites fraud and too often leads to unnecessary errors
3093176 it remains to be seen what the reasons were for the high rate of invalid signatures in this matter
3093177 ok das wird nichts das eskaliert bring dich in sicherheit

3093205 skateboarding and surfing have embraced and promoted the multicultural aspects of their sports
3093206 forty nine percent of the u s population will be hispanic african american asian or mixed by 2050
3093207 stay away from obvious ploys like plastering on mariachi music and wearing sombreros
3093208 ski resorts trying to successfully adapt to the growing minority population must recognize this new ethnic mix coming to resorts and be sure they are part of the equation
3093209 consider themselves american but have come into being in a different way from minorities and immigrants of the past its a new model where they dont just dissolve into the melting pot
3093210 ski resort environments need to be reflected in their message
3093211 hispanic families by nature like to do things together so show them that your resort is welcoming to them and their entire families young people are multicultural today
3093212 people coming from south america who are perhaps working or visiting the lake tahoe resorts for example may well be interested in seeing the multicultural communities of northern california and the bay area and that should be facilitated
3093213 theyve seen a 630 percent increase in hispanic fans a hispanic driver has won a race and corona now sponsors a nascar tour event in mexico
3093214 france is becoming increasingly isolated as one of the most expensive family destinations
3093215 most organized day care and ski school facilities for families in europe as well as family accommodations
3093216 this creates an additional argument on price family budget as 55 percent of our clients are families all social levels often with rather young kids
3093217 we even take advantage of that to organize winter launch weekends mid december during which ski rental and the days special meal in a restaurant are free all these services are available for accompanying parents for only us 10 a day
3093218 we have launched an online system that allows them to book their ski pass online and automatically get 20 percent or more discount on the public price
3093219 its been good for our company a positive every which way and having a good starting year has made it that much easier
3093220 we looked at going east a couple times in the last 20 years but it didnt come to the right fit
3093221 how things came together in 2007 after 18 months of plotting allowed us to put together a trifecta its a pretty compelling strategy from the boston market perspective we obviously stepped in at the right time and with our pacific northwest resorts as well
3093222 its known worldwide for its diverse and varied terrain tremendous snowmaking and high elevation skiing for the region powdrs expectation was to start re polishing a gem that had been tarnished by many years of neglect under asc ownership
3093223 on the management that was here but on owners that did not allow them to take care of on going maintenance that needs to be done at a ski resort
3093224 it wasnt a new lift or a base lodge or a whole new pod of skiing but people were excited to see were doing it right it builds confidence for someone buying a pass or choosing where to ski
3093225 good years are important to stimulate the marketplace to introduce new skiers and riders to the sport and provide good momentum for the industry in general but it doesnt make us giddy with notions of returns that cant be grounded in more average performance it would be foolhardy to think were going to repeat a year like this last one every year or every other year
3093226 we dont have to wait for what a winter is like with cnl and were planning for 2009 right now we will commit to capital expenditures before winter and the capital will be in place by december it wont adjust much even if we have a terrible winter season
3093227 a new base lodge going in this year complements the new milly express detachable quad in an area that used to be served by two old doubles
3093228 swimming against the tide of gas prices and mortgage issues in the younger demographic it draws
3093229 we are replacing the skye peak quad an aged long slow ride chairlift with a modern high speed detachable express chair
3093230 we find that our guests on mountain experience has gone up dramatically over prior years as measured by the same company that has done this in the past here i have a lengthy background in snow and in creating the best product we can thats a big focus of mine
3093231 we reinvest our earnings after taxes and expenses they dont go anywhere else
3093232 the relevancy of printed brochure distribution as part of a mountain resorts media mix remains very high
3093233 the link to point of sale is the key to someones start of planning a mountain vacation or getaway
3093234 brochure displays like the ones in the sports authority stores reduce the need and use of wasteful mass bulk mailings that just find their way into landfills the retail store kiosks also support the trend toward greener marketing while playing an important role in a resorts media mix
3093235 the vast majority of consumers still want to have a physical brochure guide or magazine in their hand while making seasonal sports and outdoor plans and reservations
3093236 there is strong evidence that brochures distributed in racks continue to have their basic appeals of simplicity colorful presentation and placement relevancy
3093237 they are used by a broad cross section of travelers even those who accessed the internet brochures were more effective than other tourism information channels not just to change travel plans and result in new reservations and purchases

3093270 he has had every opportunity to turn this company around and tap the abilities of its first class employees but instead he has run it into the ground
3093271 these dismal numbers speak for themselves they are a reflection of his inability to lead his incompetence as a manager and his failure in virtually every category that can be measured we have tried every conceivable way to convince him to invest in and maximize the goodwill of his employees he has failed miserably
3093272 shrinking the airline to achieve profitability has been demonstrated to be a failed business practice
3093273 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia

3093300 s a good start at the end of the day
3093301 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3093302 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3093303 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3093304 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3093305 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3093306 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3093307 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3093308 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

3093312 though the crowds on fifth avenue bear witness to the intense and varied life that the great city offers the vices perversions corruptions parasitisms and lapses of function increase disproportionately so that parasitopolis turns into patholopolis the city of mental moral and bodily disorders and finally terminates in necropolis the city of the dead
3093313 if the world hates you know that it has hated me before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love its own but because you are not of the world but i chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you
3093314 there was indeed on earth so long as it was needed a symbol and foreshadowing image of this city which served the purpose of reminding men that such a city was to be rather than making it present and this image was itself called the holy city as a symbol of the future city though not itself the reality
3093315 tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law

3093332 we got testimony from the two escorts who claimed that i was intimidating them to the extent that they were afraid for their lives
3093333 once they were on the stand they testified that i never physically or verbally harmed them or used force in any way against them or anyone else one escort even said that i was nice although he said it was nice in a passive aggressive way whenever i would walk left or right holding my sign they would surround and block me so while i was walking i would say im going to move right now or im moving left now or dont trip on the curb theyre going to follow me anyway so i try to stay calm and be polite and make sure they dont hurt themselves while trying to cover me
3093334 my attorney even asked the judge what i was supposed to do when the escorts come up to me and she said told him that i had to back away

3093336 it was just my way of trying to minimize the bias
3093337 queues are a more neutral and less visible way to solve the rationing problem let the gatekeeper open the gate one person at a time and let the others wait their turn in this system however prices do find a way to creep back through non pecuniary costs like waiting times and investments in connection building or in learning how to cajole gatekeepers those individuals whose time has lower opportunity costs because they are paid less or have less to do in life will support the wait while others with higher opportunity costs will build abilities to jump the queue those in between wont get much until they are dying
3093338 moreover a lottery is not more just than a system based on any other random factors like good genes or a better environment we have come back nearly full circle from natural random factors as they interact with private property rights to random government allocation interacting with bureaucratic and political right holders we have sacrificed efficiency and liberty in the move

3093344 well of course i am i am a good wife who allows her husband to lead in all areas note my exaggeration of reality i am trying to convince myself of my goodness
3093345 i think you should think that answer over again daughter
3093346 because you are tearing down your marriage word by word when you usurp the authority that i have given your husband
3093347 is your husbands god ordained authority in the home an issue for you do you vie for control in what areas finances parenting career color coordinating his clothes what does competition in your home look like how is it impacting your relationship
3093348 im obviously with him and he is obviously with me
3093349 whether or not were in a dual income marriage its necessary to drive home a very important point here the frightening reality is that god will hold every husband accountable for his god ordained role in the home as a leader provider and protector even if hes not a believer
3093350 instead of being my husbands completer i was his competer

3093373 its not even on the page of rational behavior unless you know something former bear ceo alan schwartz who at one time was under the impression that bsc was drowning in liquidity and was understandably flummoxed about rumors to the contrary told the senate banking committee on april 3 that there are lots of reasons why people could have a financial motivation to induce panic

3093375 in every ethnic conflict each side is right and that is about the georgian south ossetia conflict i am not talking about russia yet it is hopeless to go into ancient history or even into the soviet times georgias abolishment of south ossetias autonomy under then president of georgia gamsakhurdia was a major turning point in angering the ossetians and for launching their latest separatist movement russias role from the very beginning was not the one of a peacemaker but an active defender and supporter of the tskhinvali criminal war lord regime in fact a number of people who are in charge in the self proclaimed state stem from russias security structures in the last decade the russians have issued russian passports to the majority of south ossetia residents same is true for abkhazia it was very easy for the russians to justify the attack its citizens have been attacked never mind russias official recognition of georgias borders the level of russias preparedness for the action last week suggests that russia was getting ready for such a scenario and the question was not if but when georgia on the other hand has never seriously acted on negotiating a settlement with south ossetians there has never been a genuine offer to negotiate or a plan the military was preparing as early as 2006 when the then georgian defense minister okruashvili promised that he would celebrate christmas in tskhinvali south ossetias capital
3093376 you would really impress your party friends if you can produce a solution to this problem and not just talk about it
3093377 it depends on the length of the cocktail party and how hard you are trying to impress your date if the person you are trying to impress is of strong to medium attractiveness and stronger to medium attention span try this on
3093378 the georgians are to blame for being hotheaded and for not thinking out their game plan the russians are to blame for taking the retaliation to a level so disproportionate that it seems more shocking by the hour
3093379 to shrink the pro western and especially pro american advance in its neighborhood
3093380 the real reason is threefold a to teach the georgians and other former republics like ukraine a lesson in whos in charge in the region and the consequences of ignoring that fact b to teach the west including the european union and the united states a lesson to the limits of western power c to effectuate a regime change if possible in georgia since its president is a young western educated pro u s democrat who has had a notoriously poor relationship with putin
3093381 russia has a long history of weakening its former colonies that have west leaning ambitions by tampering with their ethnic minority populations it started way back with stalin in fact russia sees south ossetia as part of its sphere of influence and the ossetians themselves felt much closer to russia than they did the georgians whom they feared since georgia became independent from the soviet union in the early 1990s
3093382 both plus secure its interests geopolitically and economically especially with regards to energy
3093383 both they are in fact an economic superpower in ways few others are the country is awash in petrodollars from an economic standpoint one third of europes natural gas comes from russia the russians have come close to bombing though have not yet destroyed the only oil pipeline in the caucuses that bypasses russia altogether and which provides oil to western europe russia is fully aware that western friendship towards georgia exists in large part to break russian dominance and control over caspian sea oil and gas exports since georgia is a major transit hub of oil to western markets as a petrostate russia naturally finds this unacceptable from a political standpoint russia fully knows the west needs russia too much on issues such as iran to come to georgias aid in any way other than rhetorically
3093384 both what better way to flex your superpowers than to exhibit such unmediated annoyance a geek may be just as angry as a bully in a schoolyard fight but only one of them gets to show it
3093385 yes this is absolutely plausible the goal is either to knock out the pipelines or to show that it could knock them out at any moment in order to get the west to respect russias regional dominance as it is oil prices rose over the weekend in part because shipments of oil from two georgian ports have been suspended since saturday due to fighting in south ossetia
3093386 i definitely dont think that was russias motivation first of all georgia is only a transit country the source of gas and oil is azerbaijan which has a relatively good relationship to russia thats not to say that russia is happy about btc baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline it fought against it bitterly in the 1990s when the clinton administration first proposed building the pipeline with the intention of breaking russias energy monopoly but russia is good at staying within an inch of international acceptability which is to say that in their minds going after georgia is one thing spooking western investors another in new russia business is business
3093387 a good question to use a political science term the proximate the immediate

3093392 a lot of people are dying in the cells here but we dont get to see them because once they die the chinese authorities will cover it up the over 100 deaths that have been reported are those who jumped from houses to evade arrest
3093393 we are ready to leave their country but the problem is that they will arrest you destroy your passport and put you in their cells after some time they will ask if you have money for your flight back home as that is the only condition on which they will deport you or else you will remain in cells
3093394 in fact many nigerians are looking for ways to tell their people back home to send money to them before they can venture out of their homes here in china so that if they arrest you you can tell them that you have your flight money back home
3093395 you can imagine where people are given only white rice with what looks like water from a boiled pig meat once in a day and this continues as long as you remain in the cell
3093396 we want to go since they dont want us here so if the nigerian government can officially send any airline down here to convey us home you will see thousands of nigerians that will rush back home
3093397 some people who are deported are as white as a ghost you can check at the nigeria airport back home and see if you wont see more than four to five nigerians deported from china almost on a daily basis
3093398 let yaradua send airline to take us home we are not saying that they should beg for us to stay no we want to come back home if not for the problem back home where there is nothing working properly what are we doing here nigeria is better than china
3093399 behavior pertaining to misrepresenting auction rate securities to investors as safe cash equivalent products when in fact they faced increasing liquidity risk
3093400 today were expanding our investigation into the auction rate securities scandal to insure investors across new york state and the nation get their money back
3093401 we believe that when you protect the investor you also increase investor confidence which helps the entire market
3093402 enter into immediate talks about resolving the investigation as that would be in the best interests of both consumers nationwide as well as wachovia customers
3093403 we are meeting with regulators today and look forward to the discussions

3093414 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3093415 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
3093416 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3093417 the times they are a changin marital status and health differentials from 1972 to 2003
3093418 well if the disabled community has a problem why hasnt the african american community voiced its own objection to robert downey jr playing a black soldier hmmmmmmmmmm lets see the film is a satire
3093419 i see you too now fight with lasers we shall see who is better trained or in my case perfectly programmed by more than 500 martial arts experts from around the world

3093421 pay as you drive auto insurance a simple way to reduce driving related harms and increase equity
3093422 yeah we drop back to taking the i mutex in teh case where we are writing beyond eof or we have cached pages
3093423 there is only one db2 but this is one of the rare exceptions where the different product lines look less than 100 the same on the outside
3093424 if the tables and views specified in an sql routine body exist at the time the routine is created the name will first be checked as a column name if not found as a column it will then be checked as an sql variable name in the compound statement and then checked as an sql parameter name if the referenced tables or views do not exist at the time the routine is created the name will first be checked as an sql variable name in the compound statement and then as an sql parameter name if not found it will be assumed to be a column
3093425 if an sql statement contains an sql variable or parameter and a column reference with the same name db2 interprets the name as an sql variable or parameter name
3093426 if an sql statement contains an identifier with the same name as an sql variable and a column reference db2 interprets the identifier as a column
3093427 the statement is a syntax error if x could be any two of a parameter a variable a column
3093428 if n 1 true since there is only one identifier in the chain and
3093429 otherwise each possible scope tag shall be a range variable
3093430 the server gives up without notice when finding that an exception handler is invoked recursively
3093431 if there is no most appropriate handler and the condition is an exception condition then the sql statement raising the exception condition is terminated with that exception condition
3093432 mysql warnings are not the same beast as the sql standard warnings i e they have a different life cycle and they work with continue handlers differently at least now a mysql note could be considered a subtype of mysql warning only with a different severity
3093433 one should get a warning severity note for each database table that didnt exists
3093434 please be consistent say note level warnings not notes and warnings
3093435 you are full of your own opinions on how to perform scalability and high availability youve been told that the database server must be the centre of every system that complex data and business logic must reside in it you believe that a single non splittable element the san can provide unlimited scalability and reliability how can i show you how mysql scales and performs unless you first empty your cup
3093436 designed for highly available internet facing web serving environments for the next generation windows server
3093437 basically it has higher scalability than express or workgroup editions it supports up to 4 cpus no artificial limit on ram and unlimited database size
3093438 sql server 2008 has dependencies on and includes vs 2008 sp1 and its components bids is just vs 2008 ssms uses components plus netfx 3 5sp1 sql includes the rtm versions of both of these however they are not broadly released yet there is a check in sql server setup that if you have an old version beta rc whatever it will bounce the install and ask you to upgrade to the rtm bits which of course are not yet available independent of sql
3093439 im coming around to the idea that everything will be a blend of open source and proprietary software or services at least for the foreseeable future
3093440 these toys are mine i bought those toys with money i worked for whats yours is what you make with your bodies

3093474 i would have climbed over the fence and climbed up in the stands if i had a problem
3093475 now three weeks is a lot of time things could happen
3093476 the likelihood of us keeping three middle linebackers is low
3093477 so i dont think well be stacked there when it comes to cutting time
3093478 however many linebackers we keep six or seven those will be the best six or seven linebackers and the three guys that start will be the three best linebackers that we have on this team
3093479 theres a bunch of people who have a bunch of different beliefs
3093480 theres some people that dual train their linebackers im not from that school if a kid has a thousand reps in training camp i want him to get a thousand reps at one position

3093487 este inmenso desorden de am rica justifica mi conducta pol tica y los principios que la gu an espero que mis amigos se acordar n de m en esta poca de turbulencias para oponerme en contraste con los efectos de la anarqu a y hacerme la justicia que yo he deseado
3093488 la situaci n de am rica es tan singular y tan horrible que no es posible que ning n hombre se lisonjee conservar el orden largo tiempo ni siquiera en una ciudad
3093489 la am rica entera es un tumulto m s o menos extenso
3093490 la naci n que quebranta primero la ley es la nica que puede llamarse infractora y es la sola responsable de este atentado el enemigo que se sirve de las mismas armas con que se le ofende no hace sino defenderse esta es la ley m s antigua y la m s universalmente conocida y practicada
3093491 el fuego ha reducido a cenizas las ciudades y las campi as el hierro ha demolido los edificios que no devoraron las llamas el hacha del verdugo ha inmolado al ni o al anciano a la virgen al invalido sin perdonar la inocencia ni la debilidad sin perdonar en fin ni a los irracionales pues los brutos que ayudaban al hombre a la cultura de los campos y le aliviaban sus fatigas han sido exterminados por sus compa eros
3093492 el pasado es el espejo del presente y el presente es el mont n de fracasos del pasado
3093493 la am rica entera es un cuadro espantoso de desorden sanguinario vivimos sobre un volc n y nos desmoralizamos hasta el punto de desconocer todo principio de derecho y de deber no qued ndonos otro resorte capaz de producir efecto sino el de la fuerza efectiva empleada con inteligencia y oportunidad
3093494 si la am rica no vuelve sobre sus pasos si no se convence de su nulidad e impotencia si no se llama al orden y a la raz n bien poco hay que esperar respecto de la consolidacon de sus gobiernos y un nuevo coloniaje ser el patrimonio que leguemos a la posteridad
3093495 ser a justo sufrir la guerra a muerte y no hacerla
3093496 las consecuencias han acreditado y mostrado la justicia y necesidad de esta conducta pues destituidos los espa oles y canarios de la ventaja con que lidiaban y asegurados de que su suerte era igual entre nosotros a la nuestra entre ellos dejaron de considerarse amos y comenzaron a temernos como hombres
3093497 la posteridad me har justicia y esta esperanza es cuanto poseo para mi felicidad
3093498 soy inocente porque mi conciencia no ha participado nunca del error voluntario o de la malicia aunque por otra parte haya obrado mal y sin acierto la convicci n de mi inocenciame la persuade mi coraz n y este testimionio es para m el m s aut ntico bien que parezca un orgulloso delirio

3093501 what is life for to die to kill myself at once no im afraid to wait for death till it comes i fear that even more than i must live but what for in order to die and i could not escape from that circle i took up the book read and forgot myself for a moment but then again the same question and same horror i lay down and closed my eyes it was worse still
3093502 when i got the call this morning it was just devastating news
3093503 lets face it bernie mac was one of a kind he was the best of the best in terms of giving you a good laugh
3093504 under glenn tiltons tenure united has gone from being the finest airline in the world with the best route structure and safety record to a shell of its former self
3093505 he has had every opportunity to turn this company around and tap the abilities of its first class employees but instead he has run it into the ground
3093506 these dismal numbers speak for themselves they are a reflection of his inability to lead his incompetence as a manager and his failure in virtually every category that can be measured we have tried every conceivable way to convince him to invest in and maximize the goodwill of his employees he has failed miserably
3093507 shrinking the airline to achieve profitability has been demonstrated to be a failed business practice
3093508 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3093509 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3093510 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3093511 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then

3093513 you know what i dont think ive ever had a visual for just how many 2 008 people are
3093514 the desire to have it all and the illusion that we can is one of the principal sources of torture of modern affluent free and autonomous thinkers
3093515 some philosophers have argued that the very open endedness of human appetite is responsible for both our savagery and civility since a creature that could conceive of eating anything including notably other humans stands in particular need of ethical rules manners and rituals
3093516 my visit left me even more deeply convinced that we not only have a moral obligation to help displaced iraqi families but also a serious long term national security interest in ending this crisis
3093517 actually we dont disagree as much as youd think i think people assume im a democrat but im registered independent and im still undecided so im looking at mccain as well as obama
3093518 most people believe jessica is talking about being abused by a former boyfriend jessica was abused as a teenager while attending j j pearce high school in richardson texas long before she met nick lachey or any of her ex boyfriends

3093522 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
3093523 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
3093524 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in roe v
3093525 ik heb een van mijn beste maatjes verloren en dat is niet makkelijk te bevatten

3093533 its looking to be one of the worst years ive seen up here in a long time its probably an extension of the low ice year we saw last year in the beaufort sea actually throughout the arctic we havent done anywhere near what wed normally do were just not seeing many bears here i know from talking on email with alaskan colleagues theyre seeing something very similar this year as well
3093534 any notion that the population has increased in a large scale sort of context is highly unlikely highly unsupported by any scientific data we dont know how many bears there were before we have very little census data on most areas in the arctic we have no idea how many bears there were in the 1960s absolutely zero some people have said that in the 1960s there were 5 000 nobody knows

3093538 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3093539 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3093540 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3093541 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3093542 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3093543 you cant put a price on your health you cant pay not to have cancer id much rather have not got ill and not got the money but it looks like my luck is changing now
3093544 being diagnosed with cancer was quite a shock in itself but thats not as hard as dealing with the treatment
3093545 the last year has probably been the worst of my life but this year could be the best
3093546 i always said every cloud has a silver lining and that something good comes out of something bad this proves it
3093547 i was at home on the phone to my friend while checking the lotto numbers on the internet when i realised i had matched five numbers i dashed round to her house in my dressing gown i then called my mum who was staying with my aunts none of them believed me
3093548 my aunt checked on the internet and told me i had won over 2 5 million i was gobsmacked and still am
3093549 they wont get everything because i want them to understand the value of money
3093550 then they showed me the underwater shot and you can see that my hand just got there
3093551 i hope i can do well again in the 800m and its looking great for the relay team
3093552 thats a great mark of somebody whos going to go places
3093553 i saw katie hoff at 250m and saw her move off and i thought oh gosh shes gone
3093554 but i told myself to stick with it i was so tired but i came off the last turn and thought just go for it youve got nothing to lose just put your head down and go and i just went for it
3093555 as soon as i rang home everyone was screaming and shouting
3093556 then i got back to the olympic village the team had stuck on the door congratulations becky jo and i walked into the team meeting and everyone stood up and gave us a massive round of applause
3093557 its just so nice from somebody like mark foster who has been to five olympic games and i look up to and for him to be doing that for me is just unbelievable its every sportsmans dream
3093558 i dont want to take my medal off i walked into the dinner hall with it on and was just sat reading the internet with it on around my neck its the best day in my life so far
3093559 even if jeremy clarkson has slagged them off as chavvy
3093560 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3093563 it was simple we never ever used my name we never told anybody it was me who was going to do the interviews we even had a fake title for the film we called it a spiritual journey
3093564 larry charles theory is just keep going till they throw you out i guess he learned that on borat the crew would set up and at the last second when the cameras were already rolling i would show up so either theyd be seen on camera leaving the interview and lose face or theyd have to talk to me

3093575 next time id hope that the gates i help pay for will be working or maybe theyre like that to justify your salary that i help pay for
3093576 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3093577 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3093578 this years data show a slight decline in hiring projections across different industries
3093579 we believe companies are being conservative in their planning based on the current market conditions industries such as insurance public and non profit reported a lower than last years headcount increase projection
3093580 as it becomes more business oriented and is run like a business those individuals that have it skills plus business knowledge and experience or degrees will likely have the fast track into roles which often have executive level exposure
3093581 after all it organizations are looking at not only technical skills but more importantly business skills
3093582 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also

3093611 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3093612 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3093613 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset

3093968 thanks to our loyal patrons and the many new customers who have made the queen their casino of choice over the past 12 months were celebrating our best year ever
3093969 the new land based casino is definitely a success story but we have undoubtedly faced some challenges within the first year due to the declining economy and smoking ban that went into effect jan 1 st
3093970 however we are confident that our commitment to remaining the home of the loosest slots in country for the third year in a row and providing the industrys best customer service will enable us to build on the successes of our first year as a land based casino as we look to the future
3093971 our committee has been fortunate enough to rely on state and federal grant money to support our operating costs until recent years
3093972 cutbacks have resulted in the need for us to turn to community support and while our conferences are always a success we feel this tournament will be a fun and interactive way to help raise additional funds while strengthening personal relationships in an informal environment
3093973 while our gym offers a place for people to come to build strength and endurance we also want to take an active role in making sure this communitys residents in need continue to receive help
3093974 we want everyone to understand that the h i t squad is here for the community and we know working with the united way will help us do that
3093975 while this is a new venture for both the tri cities area division of the united way of greater st louis and the h i t squad the needs of a community are not new and are ever increasing

3093993 el seleccionador no me ha hablado despu s de la eurocopa y no tengo ninguna raz n por la que no me convoc para la eurocopa yo quiero jugar en el valencia me concentro en mi club y si hago un buen trabajo volver a la selecci n
3093994 creo que tenemos opciones pero al mismo tiempo hay m s equipos que las tienen pienso que si no nos despistamos podemos obtener medalla pero siempre yendo partido a partido aunque no hay que olvidar que esto acaba de empezar y a n tenemos que clasificarnos para la segunda fase y aqu no hay enemigo f cil
3093995 era todo demasiado bonito para un debutante como yo lo hab a visto anteriormente s lo por televisi n un par de veces recuerdo las de sydney 2000 y atenas 2004 fue todo muy emocionante y al mismo tiempo muy divertido estar con todos los atletas y dar la vuelta ol mpica fue algo maravilloso
3093996 mi opini n es que los podemos ganar jugando un buen partido aunque reconozco que tienen un equipo de mucho nivel
3093997 creo en la segunda fase posiblemente nos tocar alg n equipo europeo como lituania o rusia pero insisto que lo que tenemos que hacer es pasar a la segunda fase ese es ahora mismo nuestro objetivo prioritario
3093998 al margen de estas dos bajas creo que estamos haciendo un gran equipo lo fichado hasta ahora me parece interesante al menos de nombre
3093999 estoy convencido de que todo saldr bien con sito al frente del equipo estoy seguro de que lo llevar bien pues como segundo ya lo hizo muy bien ahora lo seguir haciendo bien como primero opino que las nuevas incorporaciones son buenos fichajes
3094000 si al principio las cosas no salen como todos querr amos que no pierdan la esperanza que si los inicios son dif ciles hay que seguir creyendo en nosotros pues estoy convencido que tambi n podemos ganar t tulos la pr xima temporada
3094001 contaremos con algunos jugadores nuevos y habr que tener paciencia y pedir que nuestra afici n est siempre a nuestro lado desde el principio nosotros lo vamos a dar todo para que nuestra afici n disfrute y siga viniendo al palau ol mpic como lo ha estado haciendo las dos ltimas temporadas
3094002 estamos mirando el tema con toda la intenci n de que el chaval juegue en primera divisi n pero no podemos dejarlo ir gratuitamente ya que ma ana cualquier jugador que tenga una mejora contractual va a pedir lo mismo
3094003 estamos viendo mil v as desde la contraprestaci n econ mica m nima hasta un intercambio de jugadores sin contraprestaci n econ mica por el jugador ya que es un equipo de primera divisi n el que viene a por l creo que habr a que mirarlo con cari o ser o no ser no lo s ya eso va a depender del m laga que en este caso ha realizado una oferta por el jugador

3094323 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims

3094331 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3094332 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3094333 remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works
3094334 o israel return unto the lord thy god for thou hast
3094335 this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you
3094336 for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
3094337 christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth

3094344 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3094361 these types of ads do not advance the debate in the 16th district they do more harm than good and are not reflective of the mood of the men and women who comprise our district
3094362 only muddy the water they do not add to the public discourse that candidates seeking office need to have with the voters they want to represent
3094363 i believe my opponent and i can articulate our positions clearly and effectively without outside special interest groups being a part of the process im certainly a strong supporter of the first amendment but groups like these do not contribute to healthy community conversation

3094366 we expect him to take a leadership role on a very important issue
3094367 this is one of the few times i think ive seen this year where somebody is running as a purported leader and when theyre called out on their lack of leadership is pointing the finger to other elected officials rather than stepping it up
3094368 were more concerned with what leaders are doing to alleviate pain at the pump today
3094369 it seems to me that if hes opposed to gas tax increases or conversely if he favors a break in gas prices particularly over the summer months thats a common sense first step that he could take
3094370 all were asking for is an opportunity to have a debate and a vote on our plan

3094398 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia and the further loss of life
3094399 russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of georgia and occupying the country
3094400 preparations are underway for such a meeting which is likely to take place tomorrow
3094401 a war is underway and our colleagues need to listen before consulting with their capitals and making decisions they need to listen to each party
3094402 it requires a great deal of balance shoulder strength and the ability to hold your body straight

3094409 i came here to win an olympic medal and realistically i was only ever going to win one in either singles or doubles
3094410 id like success but if i had to pick one it would be to win with my brother
3094411 to win an olympic medal with my brother would be something special
3094412 i dont want to make excuses lu just played better than me i had my chances and i didnt take them
3094413 it was a tough situation and andy losing in the singles was a bit of a shock for us he was a bit flat and some of that translated to me that happens sometimes
3094414 andy came here with high hopes of doing well in the singles and i guess he needed a bit of encouragement
3094415 it was a tough day for him but we got through and thats the main thing
3094416 the news is supposed to be under lock and key but it wont stay that way for much longer shes starting to show

3094421 if its working senator do you now have a better estimate of when american soldiers can come home from iraq
3094422 no but thats not too important whats important is the casualties in iraq americans are in south korea americans are in japan american troops are in germany thats all fine american casualties and the ability to withdraw we will be able to withdraw general petraeus is going to tell us in july when he thinks we are but the key to it is that we dont want any more americans in harms way and that way they will be safe and serve our country and come home with honor and victory not in defeat which is what senator obamas proposal would have done and im proud of them and theyre doing a great job and we are succeeding and its fascinating that senator obama still doesnt realize that
3094423 it is unbelievably out of touch and inconsistent with the needs and concerns of americans
3094424 senator mccain stubbornly refuses to acknowledge that the american people do not want our brave troops in iraq for 100 years under any circumstances
3094425 osama bin laden is freely plotting attacks our efforts in afghanistan are undermanned and our military readiness has been dangerously diminished we need a smart change in strategy to make america more secure not a commitment to indefinitely keep our troops in an intractable civil war

3094428 my doctor back then didnt believe in chronic fatigue syndrome
3094429 it was still up in the air people didnt believe it existed i think its better now but back then it wasnt
3094430 there was a sense of relief because finally there was a reason for all i was experiencing
3094431 people would constantly ask what was wrong with me and i felt like i was going crazy i never guessed it could be one particular illness that could be causing it all
3094432 i was basically eating meat and salad wheat free pasta and wheat free milk free cookies my diet was very very plain
3094433 i also have muscle aches headaches sore throats and tmj to name a few
3094434 i sleep with a night guard to help prevent my jaw from locking while i sleep although it still happens from time to time my teeth will ache and i even went a whole year unable to chew on one side of my mouth
3094435 the fatigue i experience isnt just being tired she explains
3094436 that was a great feeling to have my own place
3094437 i was not only fighting to feel better i was constantly having to justify being sick to others because so many people didnt understand others view people with chronic fatigue syndrome as unmotivated and lazy
3094438 it helped me to just accept what it is and live with it
3094439 i try to live each day to the fullest and not get so caught up in being sick its important for me not to dwell on it
3094440 i really try not to think about the illness itself and how much it has changed my life or that ill never be better
3094441 some days im not able to do as much and some days im able to do more there is life with chronic fatigue syndrome it may be different and more difficult than originally planned but it still can be a full beautiful life
3094442 hugged my niece and said she was also his daughter and cried
3094443 some of them criminals are taken to the jails but because they belong to the commanders they pay money and are set free
3094444 families are trusting the security forces and reporting these incidents
3094445 its because of the impunity given to these warlords for such a long period of time
3094446 these days all these young girls are going to school and coming out of their houses these criminals chase after them
3094447 this is like a revolt against the warlords by my family
3094448 i believe experience counts but its not everything values judgment and the record that i have amassed in my state also should count for something ive worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people my state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year fourth in income growth fourth in reduction of poverty third in overall economic performance according to a major news magazine thats because we believe in investing in education and in jobs and we have to change in this country you know my wife hillary gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result we have got to have the courage to change experience is important yes ive gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month ive touched more peoples lives and seen more heartbreak and hope more pain and more promise than anybody else whos run for president this year i think the american people deserve better than theyre getting we have gone from first to thirteenth in the world in the last twelve years since mr bush and mr reagan have been in personal income has dropped while people have worked harder in the last four years there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created we need a new approach the same old experience is not relevant were living in a new world after the cold war and what works in this new world is not trickle down not government for the benefit of the privileged few not tax and spend but a commitment to invest in american jobs and american education controlling american health care costs and bringing the american people together that is what works and you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience mine is rooted in the real lives of real people and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change
3094449 a last attack before the pa primary to do whatever it takes to win
3094450 you clintonaniacs cant see through the tears and fighting words of clinton to see that shes basically a republican in democrats clothing
3094451 good afternoon let me begin by saying that although this has been billed as an anti war rally i stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances
3094452 the civil war was one of the bloodiest in history and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword the sacrifice of multitudes that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil i dont oppose all wars
3094453 my grandfather signed up for a war the day after pearl harbor was bombed fought in pattons army
3094454 after september 11th after witnessing the carnage and destruction the dust and the tears i supported this administrations pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance and i would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such a tragedy from happening again
3094455 what i am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like karl rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured a rise in the poverty rate a drop in the median income to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the great depression
3094456 thats what im opposed to a dumb war a rash war a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
3094457 now let me be clear i suffer no illusions about saddam hussein
3094458 i know that even a successful war against iraq will require a us occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
3094459 i am not opposed to all wars im opposed to dumb wars
3094460 so for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children let us send a clear message to the president today
3094461 you want a fight president bush lets fight to wean ourselves off middle east oil through an energy policy that doesnt simply serve the interests of exxon and mobil
3094462 those are the battles that we willingly join the battles against ignorance and intolerance corruption and greed poverty and despair
3094463 the consequences of war are dire the sacrifices immeasurable we may have occasion in our lifetime to once again rise up in defense of our freedom and pay the wages of war but we ought not we will not travel down that hellish path blindly nor should we allow those who would march off and pay the ultimate sacrifice who would prove the full measure of devotion with their blood to make such an awful sacrifice in vain
3094464 this is a very difficult vote this is probably the hardest decision ive ever had to make any vote that might lead to war should be hard but i cast it with conviction
3094465 this line is my main focus right now i cant draw at all so i wont be doing any sketches but i am learning to sew i think its important to know more about the whole process of making clothes
3094466 i will return to tv when i understand it better because i didnt understand it when youre 16 you dont know what the hell youre getting into like i had no clue los angeles was a shock to the system
3094467 im lucky to know you can have more than one soul mate in life but like a true actress im always changing the way i feel about who i want to be nowadays i feel im settling more into a woman and i am understanding who i am
3094468 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3094469 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3094470 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy

3094488 all hitlers actions were fundamentally reactions he acted so that nothing would really change he acted to prevent the communist threat of a real change his targeting of the jews was ultimately an act of displacement in which he avoided the real enemy the core of capitalist social relations themselves

3094524 just interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3094525 there needs to be a international mediation there for the south ossetia issue

3094563 as we have said at least one modern authority maintains that the mausoleum in question is priscillians and this is widely accepted by the local populace as well in fact the major pilgrimage route to santiago is said to be that by which priscillians body was brought back for burial from trier

3094587 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

3094589 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3094602 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3094603 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3094604 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3094605 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3094606 work life balance is a concern for our members theres no question about that says patty ducharme national executive vice president of the public service alliance of canada
3094607 people want to find a way of doing their work and having a real life getting to enjoy time with their families their kids and aging parents
3094608 more and more women in this generation want to look for life balance work balance says arnold
3094609 but its also a challenge for the male population because theyre more involved in the home
3094610 the new models are good for work life balance but the new models are also improving the system says arnold
3094611 women have been entering the legal profession and private practice in record numbers for at least two decades the report concluded
3094612 however they have been leaving private practice in droves because the legal profession has not effectively adapted to this reality
3094613 many young lawyers both men and women find that the culture in law firms is not conducive to a balanced humane life
3094614 we have to say to employers if you want to keep the talent that is there with the 50 plus worker the network the experience the judgment then you are going to have to start making some changes
3094615 and the atmosphere in the workplace has to change you have to be sensitive to the intergenerational supervisory situations you have to give people work that they want to do that makes full use of their talent and experience that gives them respect and dignity
3094616 workhorse baby boomers moving into retirement and with younger workers dedicated to more balanced lives businesses will no longer be able to simply download more onto their employees
3094617 the generation xers have seen what these incredibly long hours have done to their parents they saw their parents on prozac on stress leave getting divorced so theyre not prepared to work the long hours
3094618 theyre saying im not going to bust my butt for you anymore
3094619 were moving from a buyers market in labour to a sellers market
3094620 organizations have long exploited their workers desire for a job and promotion and now its coming back to haunt them were seeing a decline in hours a decline in loyalty a decline in engagement all of these things are coming together
3094621 i think were going to see a lot of organizations headed by baby boomers who really dont believe this transformative change is going to occur i think theyre going to leave it too late to make changes and i think were going to see them go under
3094622 control over time and work life balance an empirical analysis
3094623 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3094624 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3094625 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3094626 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3094627 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3094628 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3094629 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3094630 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3094631 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3094635 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

3094637 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3094638 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3094639 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3094640 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3094641 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3094642 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3094643 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3094644 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3094645 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3094646 bands really make a parade and give it that authentic feeling and we wanted to make sure the bands were still going to be there
3094647 with the price of gas alone stipends are getting more important i think the bands still would have found a way to come but we wanted to make sure the bands were still going to be here

3094649 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3094650 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3094651 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3094652 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3094653 they were there having a good time and he was jumped it was totally unprovoked
3094654 i heard choking was involved i hear hes got facial injuries he was getting beat up
3094655 we didnt call the police because there was a fight we called police because we just knew that it was different we were being cautious
3094656 we have almost no trouble at sturgis the people are so happy that you just learn to recognize when things seem a little different
3094657 there were probably 30 officers outside when it happened so the response was instantaneous
3094658 its difficult but people have to wait for all of the evidence to come in and the investigation is done and it will be obvious that he was defending himself
3094659 i didnt know until after the fact that their numbers are made up of police and firefighters
3094660 they were happy go lucky guys theyd been in there throughout the rally and just seemed like normal guys that ride motorcycles and were having a couple of beers and hanging out we didnt view them as any kind of outlaw motorcycle group we had not had any trouble with them whatsoever
3094661 in our professions we are forced to deal with a lot of crap on the job we dont need it when we play
3094662 the good guys on the job and off we help the public
3094663 if we are treated in a such away sic that shows us disrespect or that violates the law we will handle the situation in a lawful manner keeping in mind our ultimate priority preserving the integrity of the iron pigs m c
3094664 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3094665 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3094666 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3094667 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3094668 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3094669 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3094670 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3094671 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3094672 this partnership with internet archive enables nasa to provide the american public with access to its vast collection of imagery from one searchable source unlocking a new treasure trove of discoveries for students historians enthusiasts and researchers
3094673 this new resource also will enable the agency to digitize and preserve historical content now not available on the internet for future generations
3094674 nasas media is an incredibly important and valuable national asset it is a tremendous honor for the internet archive to be nasas partner in this project
3094675 we are excited to mark this first step in a long term collaboration to create a rich and growing public resource
3094676 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3094677 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3094678 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3094679 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3094680 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3094681 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3094682 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3094683 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3094684 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3094685 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3094686 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3094687 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3094688 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3094689 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3094690 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3094691 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3094692 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3094693 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3094694 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3094695 were knee deep in the studio in oakland ca recording our new album right now which is coincidentally directly accross the street from the club were playing at and will be playing this show as were finishing up the mixing come check it out well play a bunch of new songs for your asses

3094800 the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer
3094801 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
3094802 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
3094803 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
3094804 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
3094805 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
3094806 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
3094807 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations democratic forms may be preserved in politics but they will not have as much reality as in a community of small peasant proprietors officials unavoidably have power and where many vital questions are so technical that the ordinary man cannot hope to understand them experts must inevitably acquire a considerable measure of control take the question of currency and credit as an example william jennings bryan it is true made currency an electoral issue in 1896 but the men who voted for him were men who would have voted for him whatever issue he had selected at the present time calculable misery is being caused by a wrong handling of the question of currency and credit but it is impossible to submit this question to the electorate except in some passionate and unscientific form the only way in which anything can be done is to convince the officials who control the great central banks so long as these men act honestly and in accordance with tradition the community cannot control them since if they are mistaken very few people will know it to take a less important illustration everyone who has ever compared british and american methods of handling goods traffic on railways knows that the american methods are infinitely superior there are no private trucks and the trucks of the railways are of standard size capable of carrying forty tons in england everything is higgledy piggledy and unsystematic and the use of private trucks causes great waste if this were put right freights could be reduced and consumers would benefit since there would be no obvious gain either to railway companies or to railway workers if a more uniform system is ever imposed it will be done not as a result of a democratic demand but by government officials the scientific society will be just as oligarchic under socialism or communism as under capitalism for even where the forms of democracy exist they cannot supply the ordinary voter with the requisite knowledge nor enable him to be on the spot at the crucial moment the men who understand the complicated mechanism of a modern community and who have the habit of initiative and decision must inevitably control the course of events to a very great extent perhaps this is even more true in a socialistic state than in any other for in a socialistic state economic and political power are concentrated in the same hands and the national organization of the economic life is more complete than in a state where private enterprise exists moreover a socialistic state is likely to have more perfect control than any other over the organs of publicity and propaganda so that it will have more power of causing men to know what it wishes known and not to know what it wishes unknown equality therefore like liberty is i fear no more than a nineteenth century dream the world of the future will contain a governing class probably not hereditary but more analogous to the government of the catholic church and this governing class as they acquire increasing knowledge and confidence will interfere more and more with the life of the individual and will learn more and more the technique of causing this interference to be tolerated it may be assumed that their purposes will be excellent and their conduct honourable it may be assumed that they will be well informed and industrious but it cannot i think be assumed that they will abstain from the exercise of power merely on the ground that individual initiative is a good thing or on the ground that an oligarchy is unlikely to consider the true interests of its slaves for men capable of such self restraint will not rise to positions of power which except when they are hereditary are attained only by those who are energetic and untroubled by doubt

3094888 the doors of success have been closed upon the creation because of six things their busying themselves with the blessings of allah instead of thanking allah for them their desire for knowledge while they abandon actions the hastiness to sin and delaying repentance the deception of having righteous companions and not taking them as examples the turning away of the dunya from them while they chase it and the approach of the afterlife towards them while they turn away from it
3094889 alas where are those erstwhile physical powers to be found today
3094890 no year or day will dawn upon you except that which follows will be worse for you until you shall meet your lord
3094891 why is it that we make du aa yet they are not responded to
3094892 because you know allaah yet do not obey him and you know the prophet sallallaahu alayhi wasallam but do not follow his sunnah and you know the quraan but you do not act upon it and you eat from the blessings of allaah but you do not express gratitude for it and you know paradise yet do not strive for it and you know the fire of hell yet do not run away from it and you know shaytaan but you do not fight him and instead obey him and you know death but you do not prepare yourselves for it and you bury the dead but do not learn a lesson from it and you have left your own faults and instead busy yourself with the faults of others

3094900 what was the best bedding that the prophet ever used in your house
3094901 it was a piece of thick cloth in the summer it was spread in four layers and in the winter in two half he spread underneath and with the other half he covered himself
3094902 hafsah go and tell these people that the prophet pbuh has set a standard by his personal example i must follow him my example and that of my other two companions the prophet pbuh and abu bakr ra is like that of three men traveling on the same road the first man started with a provision and reached the goal the second followed the first and joined him now the third is on his way if he follows their way he will also join them otherwise he can never reach them

3094910 and in that you saw the feet and toes partly of potters clay and partly of iron it will be a divided kingdom but it will have in it the toughness of iron inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay
3094911 and as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of pottery so some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle
3094912 and in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay they will combine with one another in the seed of men but they will not adhere to one another even as iron does not combine with pottery

3094917 andhe will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women nor will he show regard for any other god for he will magnify himself above them all
3094918 and he will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women nor will he show regard for any other god for he will magnify himself above them all
3094919 but instead he will honor a god of fortresses a god whom his fathers did not know he will honor him with gold silver costly stones and treasures
3094920 and he will take action against the strongest of fortresses with the help of a foreign god he will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and he will cause them to rule over the many and will parcel out land for a price
3094921 and at the end time the king of the south will collide with him and the king of the north will storm against him with chariots with horsemen and with many ships and he will enter countries overflow them and pass through
3094922 he will also enter the beautiful land and many countries will fall but these will be rescued out of his hand edom moab and the foremost of the sons of ammon
3094923 then he will stretch out his hand against other countries and the land of egypt will not escape
3094924 but he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious things of egypt and libyans and ethiopians will follow at his heels
3094925 but rumors from the east and from the north will disturb him and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many
3094926 and he will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful holy mountain yet he will come to his end and no one will help him

3095002 developments and innovations in the apparel sector 2nd quarter 2008
3095003 unfortunately the trial court incorrectly held that trademark holders and not ebay are responsible for policing the ebay site the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3095004 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3095005 we do not believe the law allows auction sites like ebay to continue to turn a blind eye to this problem while reaping profits from the listing and sale of counterfeit merchandise trademark law does not impose a duty on tiffany to police ebays site ebay designed the site and has the responsibility to police it

3095032 attack took about half of the day i e a bit less than 10 hours
3095033 so if you have a gige lan any trojaned machine can poison your dns during one night
3095034 while i think its bad that anybody who can hammer you at gige speed for ten hours can poison your cache its not a threat to the real world the way 11 seconds at 10 megabit was
3095035 any dns server with a host based firewall can implement a 100 effective mitigation for the polyakov attack and its possible that an upstream outboard firewall could also be made to do it
3095036 at some point isc will have to put logic like this into bind of course but protecting against the polyakov attack is like synflood protection in that its a rate limit problem

3095087 gt bush aide nobly comes forward and assumes full responsibility for who would have the balls general lack of awareness of stuff to actually stand up and proclaim that they were the person solely responsible for the movie box office flop featuring the wildly improbable ly retarded plot of an exact tie in the presidential election that comes down to one man because of a crazy voting malfunction

3095110 la transferencia del dominio de cuatro manzanas de la zona de casa amarilla linderas con las instalaciones del club para la realizaci n de actividades deportivas sociales y culturales
3095111 sin perjuicio de lo expuesto les informamos que la transferencia por ustedes solicitada podr a ser atendida en forma parcial y a t tulo oneroso previa intervenci n legislativa que autorice la modificaci n del destino del inmueble

3095127 only approved orange hooters girl shorts are to be worn sized to fit and should not be so tight that the buttocks show
3095128 hooters does have an owl inside its logo and uses an owl theme sufficiently to allow debate to occur over the meanings intent
3095129 the work environment is one in which joking and innuendo based on female sex appeal is commonplace
3095130 to hooters the womens rights movement is important because it guarantees women have the right to choose their own careers be it a supreme court justice or hooters girl

3095132 with our new design we may be able to get to 2 000 watts per square foot were very excited about what were doing
3095133 we expect that our competitors will try to replicate our design
3095134 but they cant build one like it for another two years so we have two to three years and by then we will have 1 million square feet we have the ability to build three more of these on this site each at 400 000 square feet
3095135 connectivity wise theres not another building in america that comes anywhere near what we can do
3095136 like pulling up to the alaska pipeline to get your gasoline
3095137 its hard to create efficient cooling in places where it truly human and blending hot and cold air is ridiculous
3095138 heat is 100 percent contained and processed into heat ceilings cold air is dropped past all 42u servers we ve tested and proven this by thermal imaging the size on the cold air duct work can support 24kw of cfm for each rack its completely modular and can be adjusted to suit lower density requirements
3095139 the designs were based on 10 or 20 year old patents and theyre still built today like they were 10 years ago
3095140 we said we have to stop looking to the industry for a solution we have to build it ourselves we got outside that box and talk to creative people addressing problems similar to yours
3095141 they re glass buildings in the desert they put large amounts of research and development and to cooling systems they all did it a little differently
3095142 we were consolidating some of our data center operations and were fascinated with their proposal
3095143 we assumed going in that because we would need to cool 20kw racks wed wind up with water or some kind of location solution
3095144 they promise a lot and they deliver a lot these guys know their stuff were planning to significantly expand our footprint when the supernap opens they keep their word and they do what they say theyre going to do it takes a lot of complexity off my plate
3095145 my brother who suffers from tuberculosis my sister and two uncles who have never been involved in any type of demonstration or protest were detained without cause on the grounds of what can only be assumed as mere suspicion my parents figure that at least a couple of thousand innocent tibetans from lhasa city alone are imprisoned where they are maltreated neglected and possibly tortured they were finally released my brother and sister were first taken beaten with rifles kicked and thrown into a truck they were taken out of the city to an unknown location and were put into a small concrete room with 400 other tibetans there were no washrooms and they received no food nor water for two days and nights hardly anyone could stand up by themselves because of the beatings after two days they were transferred to another place where there were about 6000 tibetans there they received a bowl of rice or small steam cooked bread twice per day they received water and had a toilet in this location after a week in this place they were transferred again where they stayed around two weeks here they got blankets to sleep with but before they had to sleep on the concrete floor with no blankets at this final location they also had first aid assistance which was needed as many people had broken bones when they released my brother and sister they kept my brothers watch and his rosary which had some semi precious stones and all the money they had they dont use banks and keep most of their money on them
3095146 the government is also limiting communication in particular areas since march they have shut down numerous cellular towers and more recently denied access even on satellite phones there may not be any more uprisings there are troops in every town that has paved roads the army marches through town streets three times a day paralyzing the tibetans with fear surveillance cameras were installed in places that dont even have running water many monks nuns and students were forced to return to the area that their id card was issued since travel outside of their hometown is officially prohibited right now foreigners are not allowed to stay in areas that have had protests in amdo many people remain in prison since the march uprisings their families unable to come up with bail bail can range from 1 000 to 2 000 private schools have been shut down in amdo and teachers and principals face threats of losing their jobs

3095162 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3095163 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3095164 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3095165 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3095166 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3095172 we do everything we can to make sure we maintain a two way conversation with the constituents of our district
3095173 rep boehner believes its very important to keep his constituents informed about what is happening in washington but he wants to make sure that were communicating in the most cost effective way possible
3095174 weve found it to be a very valuable part of representing our district
3095175 if we find a topic that has a common interest we do a franked mail piece out to constituents
3095176 if you read these pieces you have a very different picture of his record than you would by looking up his actual record

3095180 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
3095181 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
3095182 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
3095183 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
3095184 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
3095185 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
3095186 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
3095187 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
3095188 weve done a great job we really have we can do better tomorrow but im so proud of you girls
3095189 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3095190 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3095191 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3095192 thank al lah you have made it home safely my aisha
3095193 where by al lah have you been why were you alone with a man who is not your husband
3095194 it is no wonder that aisha rhymes with fahisha whore
3095195 galloping through the center of town with her hands on another man and her hair waving like a harlots dress
3095196 a harlot with vomit stinking breath and hair like a birds nest
3095197 i am happy to see her alive praise al lah
3095198 yaa habibati what reward should i offer safwan ibn for bringing you home safely to me
3095199 apparently umar thinks i should have been left at the mercy of the jackals or the bedouins
3095200 i heard him moments ago reciting a damning poem about your wife and that womanizing soldier
3095201 im the wife of holy prophet would i want a nobody like him
3095202 medina churns with sickness over your ruin aisha men are fighting in the streets over your guilt or innocence our own people have turned against one another the unity of the umma is threatened because of you
3095203 how can i defend her when safwan himself will not speak on her behalf
3095204 my father gave it to me on my wedding day remember
3095205 it means as much to me as the necklaces youve given your other wives
3095206 i searched my clothing the floorboards of my howdah the ground i would have asked the driver to help me but he was watering the camels
3095207 i followed my path back to the dunes i sifted the sands with my fingers then when i was about to give up i found it i ran back to the caravan but you were far away like ants crawling single file into tomorrow i knew i could never catch you so i sat down to wait for someone to come back for me
3095208 you waste our time with this fantasy while we all know the real story
3095209 as the sun rose i found shade under a grove of date palm trees
3095210 i lay down keeping cool then i must have slept because the next thing i remember is safwans hand on my shoulder
3095211 did you hear that prophet safwan ibn is now touching your wife we all know where that leads
3095212 i felt a sharp cramp like a knife in my stomach
3095213 i couldnt travel not while i was doubled over with pain so safwan pitched his tent for me to rest in out of the sun
3095214 and where was safwan while you were lying in his tent
3095215 i retched for hours safwan tried to help me he gave me water and fanned me with a date palm frond finally he became frightened and we came back for help
3095216 why was safwan lagging so far behind the caravan was it because he knew you would be waiting for him under the date palms
3095217 to watch for the return of the mustaliq to their camp
3095218 i have loved her since she sprang from her mothers womb i have played dolls with her and her friends i have drunk from the same bowl with her
3095219 not a little girl anymore although many years younger than you safwan is much closer to her age
3095220 then let us find a more suitable place to talk
3095221 i am not leaving you habibati but i have decided to send you to your parents house for a while abu bakr and umm ruman will nurse you back to health al lah willing away from all these wagging tongues
3095222 a scandal like this could tear it apart you must act now cousin send her back to abu bakr for good
3095223 i would just as soon cut out my own heart
3095224 you need to distance yourself from her before this scandal marks you also many men in this town would love to see you fall
3095225 i know you can then why do you look so worried wives are easily acquired you will find another child bride
3095226 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father amp loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3095227 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man
3095228 my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3095229 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
3095230 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
3095231 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
3095232 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
3095233 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
3095234 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
3095235 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
3095236 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
3095237 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
3095238 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
3095239 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
3095240 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you

3095268 it was amazing to use my body as an instrument rather than as an ornament
3095269 doing the same thing every day is not right for my temperament
3095270 i think we will see a definite shift toward local foods and other ways to stretch the food dollar while still maintaining healthy meals for children
3095271 for me as a registered dietitian this is a perfect time to make portion control a focus
3095272 obviously if we can bring portion sizes down to a more appropriate level it will help tremendously with expenses this is a great opportunity for schools to examine healthy portion sizes which not only improve the health of students but cut down on costs as well
3095273 districts will probably need to do more seasonal thinking when it comes to food choices
3095274 while fresh berries might be too expensive in the winter at some schools oranges or grapefruit might not
3095275 schools have access to federal allocation for fresh fruits and vegetables
3095276 but since the amount is limited the district may find it difficult to keep fresh produce on their menus throughout the year
3095277 economically its a great way to keep produce on school menus longer
3095278 i suspect that for most districts it is going to be a challenge even with their creativity because food costs have just taken off
3095279 using local foods helps with environmental sustainability and cuts down greatly on shipping costs
3095280 it also increases the likelihood of getting a fresher product
3095281 the food that goes into these kids is what fuels their academics

3095287 when my middlest daughter came home from high school talking about nano neeno something or other and asking if she could please please do it i had to consider my answer kathryn was in grade 12 last year and on top of the normal pressures of her final high school year she was trying to recover from a head injury and whiplash from a serious car accident to invest in a month of writing on top of grade 12 courses seemed ridiculous she was barely making it to school 2 days a week because of pain headaches and dizziness but it was only september and i did not have to commit my answer until november so i gave a hmmm maybe by october it became clear that this was an important goal kathryn and her best friend were having character planning meetings over mcflurries or sitting outside by a river or in a corner of the high school under the stairs and when she could not get out of bed she was still excited about the setting of her book or googling supporting historical or geographical details who knew the nanowrimo bug would be contagious by mid october my youngest daughter was doodling ideas and i had begun checking out historical novels for some uh research of interest november first we all three were on board it was exciting and fun comparing notes over dinner when one of us was faltering another would bring out the thesaurus or start throwing out outrageous ideas until the writer gave in to our well meant support and started writing again for kathryn alas her computer hard drive died in week three although her amazing dad was able to bring it back from the dead before the deadline she was short by several thousand words no tears though she is proud of her story and looking forward to another bout of writing in the future i had done my minimum a week before the 30th but robin my 16 year old was fighting it to the end having done much of her writing by hand she was madly smashing her fingers into the keyboard trying to enter the requisite count before midnight you could feel the electricity it was so exciting how close she was and she made it we all wooped it was a family effort but that is not my story on christmas morning we all gathered to open stockings and my husband the very sneaky and crafty man that he is presented each of us with a hard cover book he had snuck into our computers and stolen our words bought antique books and carefully removed the pages and printed our stories page by page on quality paper with a paper cutter and binding kit hed carefully glued our precious works of art into personalized covers that he entitled with gold leaf i tear up just thinking about it oh the stories are not finished and not edited and for myself on days when i could think of nothing to write i wrote little blurbs and burps that are now hanging out the back end waiting to be cauterized but we love them all just the same kathryn graduated with top marks in creative writing math and philosophy but i dont think she will measure her last year at home by the marks she got in grade 12 she will look at the three books on our bookcase written by herself her sister and me and remember the year we all did nanowrimo

3095301 consumers may be cutting back in terms of discretionary spending but they are not about to send their kids to school without the necessities
3095302 consumers are clearly shifting to value and one stop shop channels as they seek to optimize shopping trips
3095303 retailers at risk this back to school season are the specialty retailers such as office supply stores where distinct trips are needed and apparel retailers which are heavily skewed to discretionary spending
3095304 consumers recognize that retail prices tend to fall the closer we get to the first day of school
3095305 stung by high gas and food prices many consumers will likely hold out as long as possible waiting for retailers to drop prices on items kids need for the new school year

3095315 beeley wood presents an excellent opportunity for a broad range of recycling companies who are looking to create custom buildings in which to house their operations
3095316 the site which in size equates to roughly 25 football pitches is easily large enough to accommodate an entire recycling village and we are happy to speak to any organizations that would like to find out more about the development opportunities available
3095317 the recycling sector is set to grow significantly in the region
3095318 we estimate that in yorkshire and humber alone the public and private sectors will commit investment of 3 billion to waste management and recycling over the next three years a major challenge for businesses seeking to capitalize on this market potential has been the availability of suitable development sites the size and location of beeley wood the opportunity to network with other similar businesses and the supportive environment make it a nationally significant development for the sector
3095319 for recycling businesses the site is close to large concentrations of potential commercial and local authority customers and has the scale to become the recycling hub for the north of england propelling yorkshire and humber towards the premier division of recycling regions the scale of the site is such that over time specialist recycling and energy recovery businesses will find other companies on the site which provide the vital raw materials expertise and knowledge to help them establish and demonstrate advanced technologies

3095401 the verifying process of checking millions of petition signatures is something my office took very seriously in compliance with the arizona revised statutes

3095493 she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3095494 were working on him they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
3095495 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
3095496 however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
3095497 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3095498 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
3095499 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
3095500 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3095501 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3095502 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
3095503 when i showed up to work he said something to me that had never been said to me on a set before he said baby girl the script here is not the bible do you and ill follow i got mine you get yours when he said that i knew everything was going to be all right i was happy to have the freedom to make up some funny with him it was simply delicious my working experiences with bernie were so amazing that from that point on i wouldnt have cared if he called me in the middle of the night to come and be in a scene where i didnt have anything to do but sit in the background and eat cereal i wouldve just done it because i loved him like that
3095504 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
3095505 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice and the content of his material bernie fell into that category of people who were inherently different like when you saw them you knew they were different and when they spoke you knew they were different as comics were all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
3095506 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
3095507 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
3095508 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
3095509 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
3095510 he was a genuinely funny and nice guy i say this because prior to working with him on the show i had no knowledge of who he was and how well known of a comedian he was but unlike a lot of people at his level he was very friendly down to earth and accommodating when our paths accidentally crossed about a week later at lax airport he greeted me as if i had been a life long friend and i could feel the genuine warmth and sincerity of that greeting may god have mercy on his soul
3095511 bernie mac will be remembered i met him on the set of b b s kids his words of encouragement helped me to continue to pursue my career in comedy his comedy had an impact on our community and the world he will truely be missed
3095512 bernie mac had the ability to effortlessly make people laugh he was an incredible talent with whom my colleagues and i in aafca always looked forward to covering bernie had a big heart and he will certainly be missed by the members of our organization
3095513 bernie mac was never so much bernie mac on television tv wasnt ready for his genius because bernie mac was one thing that we have never heard a brilliant and extraordinarily well informed sports authority who cursed like a sailor ive seen his brilliance twice once in that form with bryant gumbel on his hbo show real sports and the other time in spike lees film get on the bus get on the bus was bernie macs debut to a big audience and he still had that raw edge of a black man not sufficiently appreciated ask me and ill say the phrase grown ass man started then and there with bernie mac bernie mac was conservative people tend to act as if they dont understand what black conservatives are like as we remember bernie mac keep that in mind
3095514 issac hayes was a lyrical man in a big black man suit somehow he always seemed heavier to me than he actually was he never managed to convert his intimidating largeness in the way james brown the sportscaster or geoffrey holder did so i am particularly aware of how he generated an elaborate sort of music on the edge of orchestral his voice was uniquely earthy and passionate in a way so many of us wanted to be known in the 70s soulful with a capital s but unlike a load of other singers hayes didnt spend a lot of time saying huh like the chorus of kool and the gangs jungle boogie so popular in those days all of these thoughts on hayes are new for me and gotten in the past year some npr show hipped me to him and i listened seriously for a short time thats what i got im sure weve lost all that and more as a side note when i was in cleveland a few short weeks ago i had lunch in the galleria and the jazzy joint there one of the waitresses flirted with me saying that i reminded her of issac hayes it was one of the few times in life i was too taken aback not to have a sweet rejoinder i could only blush and smile i think issac would have wanted it that way
3095515 what i believe were dealing with is one of those foreign policy challenges where there are no good solutions just bad solutions with varying consequences we cant let russian aggression go on without condemnation but neither can we afford to get ourselves involved in a war even a war by proxy with russia what we need is a quick end to the conflict we can hope russia and georgia come to a resolution on their own or we can be proactive and make the kind of hard diplomatic choices the situation requires george bush and his administration will have to handle this conflict but i will be watching closely the comments of barack obama and john mccain so far obama has seemed scattered in his response and mccain has seemed bellicose but they will both have more opportunities to comment on the conflict itll be interesting to see if either are willing to discuss hard real world choices or if both are content to speak broadly and avoid details
3095516 hillary clintons former communication director howard wolfson is claiming that the medias failure to uncover disclose john edwards affair cost clinton the nomination in wolfsons thinking if edwards had dropped out before iowa clinton would have won that state and then cruised to the nomination man those clinton supporters are bitter arent they obama put up a lot of wins after edwards dropped out so i think its odd that wolfson would think edwards voters would have naturally gravitated to clinton rather than to obama without edwards in the race obama would have likely still won iowa additionally given that clintons husband ran for the presidency while lying about his affair with gennifer flowers i dont think anyone in the clinton camp should get too high and mighty about edwards affair and his decision to keep the matter private john mccain must be loving the continued whining coming from clinton supporters
3095517 firstly such an absolute standard would automatically disqualify owners of landmarked buildings from obtaining this statutory remedy secondly requiring an owner to knock down the entire exterior shell of a building in areas as densely populated as new york city and its neighboring counties could create extremely unsafe conditions to pedestrians and the occupants of neighboring buildings and could even cause significant structural damage to neighboring or attached edifices
3095518 the legislatures intent with this law was to allow for the demolition of dilapidated and dangerous housing in order to allow for the creation of new safe rental units however ill intentioned owners have been applying to simply renovate the interior of buildings and turning them into high end rental and coop units with the intention of getting rid of their rent stabilized tenants since the demolition provision allows owners to clear entire buildings and provides no special protection to senior citizens phony demolitions are considered one of the most serious threats to rent stabilized housing that we have seen
3095519 by subtracting the tenants monthly rent from a city wide mean rent for similarly sized apartments and multiplying the difference by 72
3095520 the dhcrs proposed rule seeks to base the stipend on a buildings zip code in order to provide tenants who are subject to eviction with more equitable relief

3095522 joyce carol oates is one of the great writers of our time
3095523 that gave us a shortfall of approximately 300 000 we went back to acoa who is our partners in this and the provincial government and told them our dilemma and they reciprocated and came back and picked up a portion the relevant portion of the overrun and the province did the same thing and we did the same thing so the 300 000 its less 195 000 we got from them less 70 we got from the province so we only have to find 40 000 which we are doing
3095524 normally we allow for some leeway i would suggest the end of march mid april our goal is to be doing something there next summer probably starting in may month thats on a scaled down version just getting our feet wet
3095525 we hope to have an official opening around the first of july that is just our ambition our aspiration thats not set in stone that will be dictated by a plan that will be put in place over the winter for the operations and there will be a person put in place to coordinate the construction and do the business plan and operational plan for startup and to consult with whoever got to be consulted
3095526 we want to issue a welcome to all people from the area this weekend is going to be a good time for young and old
3095527 we hope you enjoy the come home year weekend and bring away with you armloads of prizes stomachs full of food souvenirs of the weekend and most importantly wonderful memories to cherish without a doubt youll be able to say what a wicked time we had by
3095528 i was hired by the community of tickle cove bonavista bay south for 11 months to write a history of their town the research began in august 2003 by interviewing a handful of the towns oldest residents about 85 percent of the books info came from captain john russell now 101 he was born at tickle cove in december 1906 and has lived in bonavista since 1952 after the job ended i moved to the middle east and spent another two years writing and re writing the book and in late 2006 flanker press agreed to take it on the first edition sold out quickly and the publisher has been kept busy since trying to fill back orders
3095529 aside from the basic intentions of writing the towns history from day one i wrote it from an angle whereby it could be one day used in the school system as a newfoundland history resource now that thats about to happen im happy the book will reach its fullest potential children and young adults will have another chance to enjoy many stories songs poems and photos representing the lives once lived by generations of newfoundlanders who truly worked hard to allow the easy life in comparison many have today
3095530 id like to see the book spark enough interest where young people would step back and think about the lives lived by their grandparents and great grandparents etc and from this be inspired enough to take the time to sit and chat with older family members and their towns seniors about the old times and old ways with the intentions of one day passing the history along to their own children and grandchildren its essential to the survival of the remnants of our unique cultural heritage
3095531 i was always interested in trains so i was going through some old pictures that i had and i found pictures of the train station and pictures of the hospital i just decided that i should try and make one
3095532 there were times that i was going to put the hammer through it
3095533 she really encouraged me to keep going many of times i was going to give it up if it wasnt for her
3095534 it was fantastic i really appreciated it and it gives me more interest in doing more models its really interesting i got a lot of feedback from the people around and the people who think my models should stay in the area
3095535 i hope to sell the model because my storage space is limited i would also like it to be preserved somewhere to keep the memory alive for present as well as for future generations i am disappointed that it seems they will have to leave my own area but any attempts to sell them locally have been in vain
3095536 my profile and interest in model making is being published by known author mr edward lake in a book he has been commissioned to write for the provincial government
3095537 if lcrosss booster stage hits a patch of lunar regolith that contains at least 0 5 percent water ice water should be detectable in the plume of ejecta

3095539 if we dont get ejecta into sunlight it wouldnt matter if we hit an iceberg because we would never know it
3095540 weve gone through essentially every possible launch date and picked a crater for each date
3095541 it really is going to turn into an international event
3095542 everyones going to be training their eyes on the impact to observe it
3095543 i did not come here to sing any songs i did not come hear to impress you guys i am a broken man i am in desperate need of jesus presence i am begging that he shows up in this place tonight does anyone else in this room need god to come down and show up here is anyone else in this place hurting and alone then raise your hands to heaven and beg for his presence to fall in this place
3095544 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her
3095545 she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired

3095636 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3095637 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3095638 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3095642 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3095643 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3095644 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3095645 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3095646 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3095648 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3095649 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3095650 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3095651 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3095652 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3095653 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3095654 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3095657 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

3095660 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3095661 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3095662 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3095663 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3095664 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3095665 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3095677 this is the worst cover up in the history of the military
3095678 when the issue i believe of the use of the vaccine comes out i believe it will make the walter reed scandal pale in comparison
3095679 i cant look at my old pictures i really cant
3095680 i start looking at my old pictures and i start crying
3095681 i looked at every branch but i wanted the marine corps because the marine corps was the few and the proud
3095682 they asked us our name we stood on these yellow footprints and they gave us this shot and we got the rest of the day off
3095683 after that shot i started swelling up i gained 30 pounds of water my eyes swelled up where i couldnt see i started snoring i developed a rash on my hand

3095689 my biggest wish just to get up and be without pain
3095690 we cant wait to get our hands on the electronic lancer and the

3095693 need to show that there will be a political cost for this action in terms of the relationship of the russian federation with its western partners
3095694 either we find a way to respond to russias military action together or we have to live with the decision that we will face a different world tomorrow
3095695 the invading army of the russian federation has entered georgian territory outside the conflict zones of abkhazia and south ossetia
3095696 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia and the further loss of life
3095697 so far we have got from them moral support and humanitarian aid but we need more than that to stop this barbaric aggression

3095806 this is a new position for me to be in
3095807 there is no plan b we just need to make sure we get through this
3095808 this study demonstrates that direct pharmacological blockade of task 1 and task 3 channels protects the most sensitive target of fetal alcohol exposure cerebellar purkinje cells
3095809 you know theyre going to come after you now right
3095810 although weight does rise when you come off the restricted diet if you take alpha lipoic acid even though you are eating normally again you still have reduced weight
3095811 it seems that alpha lipoic acid fools the body into behaving as if it was still on whatever diet it was following before the supplement was added
3095812 at ihome were continually striving to create products that offer users new ways to experience and enjoy their ipods
3095813 the artistic design of the ih41 is great for tight spaces and its smart hands free functionality make watching and listening to the ipod more enjoyable than ever before
3095814 the amount of technology included in todays luxury home has increased dramatically in the past few years
3095815 our new touchscreens not only offer a proven solution that provides the most effective way of interfacing with these complicated subsystems they also allow infinite display personalization
3095816 there is no job that is americas god given right anymore
3095817 der belgische verband wird mit dem hsv kontakt aufnehmen um das problem zu l sen
3095818 zum training am dienstag soll kompany wieder bei uns sein
3095819 wir hatten eine verabredung nach der vincent die ersten beiden spiele machen konnte danach sollte er zur ckfliegen
3095820 there are about 50 million people in this province and the interim pm and his team is visiting places in this province
3095821 in fiji we burn and throw away bagasse and the pm thinks such projects will help them use bagasse
3095822 we want prisoners to take ownership of this project so they can tell the public of their own experience
3095823 but i think both sides should come to an understanding both sides need to build that trust for integration for acknowledging that because a people has committed an offence that does not mean he or she has nothing to contribute to society
3095824 fdb should not reject his request simply because he went to prison
3095825 if i have skills and go to a furniture maker the furniture maker should not reject me simply because i went to prison not withstanding my skills
3095826 many of us are already struggling because our last cane payment had a lot of lease deductions made to it which was not supposed to be so the farmers did not earn enough money
3095827 many farmers did not receive fertiliser early this year to prepare their farms for the harvesting season so cane has not produced high yield
3095828 that is too much and farmers have complained to the association about the high charges of lorry owners
3095829 fsc would not be in a position to subsidise as it will face huge challenges to contain costs
3095830 locking up offenders and throwing away the key does not and will not work
3095831 history also shows us we have a very high rate of recidivism we have a very young population in the prison system
3095832 people must not feel that because you have initiatives like the yellow ribbon programmes and initiatives of rehabilitation that the law or system is going soft on convicted persons
3095833 yes there would be instances where victims of crime may find it hard to forgive but yellow ribbon is not necessary focus on reconciliation between the offender and the victim its focus on the person not re offending
3095834 im really in prison and my love she still holds the key a simple yellow ribbons what i need to set me free
3095835 so we loaned it and it is here for standby
3095836 technology is so advanced that every now and then there is a new model and the old ones are outdated
3095837 that machine processes the film without it we cant conduct an x ray on anybody
3095838 we reached here about 9am and were told the machine was down so my mother couldnt go for x ray
3095839 we know there are people with different views on the charter and they are allowed to express their views as part of their freedom of speech
3095840 let me make it clear we are not going to take everyone who speaks against the charter for questioning but the police will be on the lookout for people who are trying to create trouble
3095841 it does not necessarily mean that if government thought of a 20c tax on sales it would be deemed correct
3095842 if the government goes ahead levying exorbitant sales tax on local bottlers who are relatively young and small the end result would be discouraging and would be too late since damage would have been done
3095843 the council would like to thank the fsc for guidance and formulation of the revised allowances which is most welcomed by lorry owners this will be backdated with effect from june 1 2008
3095844 the council and fsc will need to explore initiatives and measures to mitigate rising costs of fuel
3095845 we want to sit and talk about the issue and come to a solution on our problems
3095846 nor is it my view that the present proceedings should be struck out by reason of its commencing by originating summons
3095847 however i do consider it is appropriate for pleadings to be provided in this case to assist the court and ultimately in my view the parties
3095848 he was a humble person and very sensitive to many cultures that make up the membership of the pacific islands forum family
3095849 he advocated the needs of small island states within the forum and started a process for recognition of non government organisations within the activities of the forum
3095850 we are saddened by the news i have known him for a long time since he was the australian high commissioner here before taking up the secretary generals post at the forum secretariat
3095851 his passing is a loss to pacific island countries and i offer my condolences to his family
3095852 the fire boys saw the deceased still trapped in the vehicle and took it on themselves to rescue them using their equipment
3095853 all the time the boys were carrying out rescue operation police had not arrived so the boys loaded the bodies on the vehicle and took them to sigatoka hospital
3095854 we have advised all our stations in the west if they are called in for any accident they are to inform me or our corporate affairs officer mileta ting
3095855 i dont know who removed the body but what i was told was that an off duty officer travelling to the west helped the fire team bring the bodies to the station and to the morgue
3095856 i do not know the name of the off duty officer
3095857 our fire crews are trained for road accident rescue they have undergone training in the use of specialist equipment which are used in a traffic accident rescue operation including securing the accident site and emergency care for any casualties
3095858 i did not say any such thing to my investigating officer that is not true she was not threatened at all
3095859 she was read her constitutional rights and after the interview she was released we followed procedure and the law
3095860 i will not say if she is a witness or suspect we cannot determine that at this stage we will wait for the outcome of the investigation
3095861 we are not trying to undermine mr bainimaramas government we are just happy he had the courage to sack a man who has done little to improve the country
3095862 the fiji labor party has expressed surprise that the fiji times gives any credibility to the ranting of a discredited politician rejected five times by the electorate
3095863 ratu epeli ganilau when he was minister for fijian affairs promised us after we met with him in suva in august last year that the reserved land would be returned to the landowners before the mill was commissioned we now know it was a lie
3095864 landowners dont have enough land to plant or develop commercial farms and get an income because most reserved land was planted without their knowledge
3095865 it seems the government is supporting the illegal activities of its company fiji pine in that they are using reserve land for the cultivation of pine which they are now about to make so much money from
3095866 i tried at that time but then there was a change in government and i took up this portfolio but thats not to say the issue is closed they can take it up with the interim pm
3095867 several rotarians and volunteers did most of the cleaning repair and painting work we spent 120 hours to refurbish the place and we are proud and grateful to our members
3095868 we cook for about 100 people three times a day and i am sure with the new facilities especially the stainless steel sinks and hot cold water system staff will be eager to work and spend more time in the kitchen
3095869 i have always been interested to be part of the hibiscus and i want to enjoy myself at the hibiscus during the two week break rather than get bored at home
3095870 i saw the advertisement in the papers and i told my parents i was interested i always like taking part in extra curricular activities outside school and i couldnt think of anything better than the hibiscus to spend my school holiday
3095871 however what i find most disturbing and annoying is when people come to disturb me when i am sleeping or trying to sleep
3095872 i have not been offered that position by the prime minister i have a job to do in china and am concentrating on doing this job to the best as there are a lot that needs to be done here
3095873 we believe that more people were involved in the incident so we are carrying out our own investigations
3095874 security measures will be reviewed and it will be improved to ensure such incidents are not repeated
3095875 a security firm is responsible for security after we called for tenders so we will be working with that firm
3095876 when i came down yesterday i was shocked to see the number of bush fires the whole landscape seemed charred and it was sad to see extensive damage to the environment not to mention the threat to human lives
3095877 the dangerous factors to consider when lighting a fire these days are the weather which has been dry for quite some time and the wind its been very windy lately
3095878 we know this is high season for burning especially in cane farms but greater precautionary control need to be exercised
3095879 its very easy for fires to spread in this kind of weather its the responsibility of everyone to be more cautious especially when a small fire can easily spread like wildfire through forests because of the dry windy spell we are experiencing
3095880 we urge the public to be vigilant with the careless fire incidents and report the culprits to police for prosecution
3095881 people should be more careful when lighting a fire outdoor and to properly discard lit cigarettes or matches
3095882 this warning comes in light of the dry and windy conditions in the west which contributed to the recent spate of outdoor fires in the nadi area on saturday

3095889 we went to his office with a lot of hope and expectations that he would listen to our plight concerning our priest imran patel who looks after the koronivia mosque
3095890 we also went to ask why the immigration department was trying to send him back to india
3095891 we were still talking to the other officials when he came into the office and started swearing at us and told us to get out of the office
3095892 he was not willing to have any conversation with us and told his officers to throw us out
3095893 when no one acted on his instructions he started forcefully pushing us out and continuously used abusive language
3095894 i have no regrets for my actions and yes i was furious and chased them out of my office
3095895 i will not tolerate anyone walking into my office and blackmailing me to remove me from my position if i dont do what pleases them i have no respect for such people
3095896 if his contract has been cancelled by the main body it means that his permit is null and void and therefore he will be asked to go back to where he came from

3095904 i dont want to offend him in any way but its business as usual i dont think its something were thinking about or talking about the nature of what we do we lose teammates all the time its just a hard part of our business
3095905 the information we are gathering right now is valuable as i have said all along i believe in all three guys

3095915 all of my preparation was going toward being the starting quarterback in 08 it is what it is the positive is that i can take out of it is the opportunity to learn from brett favre
3095916 it seems like a very competitive group right now everyone is right in the mix
3095917 if i can continue to stay healthy im definitely confident that i can make it back ive got a lot of good years left in me
3095918 when you take this job you realize who the owner is and you realize most guys dont last very long it is what it is
3095919 there was so much hype last year and so much expectation all training camp it was super bowl and we werent afraid to talk about it i fell in that trap too we have an understanding of what it really takes
3095920 i told him just because were going in this direction doesnt mean you cant win

3095984 ser peligroso si evo interpreta el 60 de votos obtenidos como un cheque en blanco
3095985 esa lectura implicar a una mayor polarizaci n porque la respuesta a esa decisi n ser a una radicalizaci n de las autoridades departamentales
3095986 las regiones tienen que entender que hay un l der nacional con respaldo mayoritario

3095988 m s apoyo de la poblaci n a la democracia en una situaci n de crisis pol tica tan aguda no se puede pedir la tranquilidad fue inesperada en funci n de lo que se vivi en los d as anteriores
3095989 ya no tiene sentido seguir pregunt ndole a la gente lo mismo ahora tienen que trabajar los pol ticos que hasta ahora no estuvieron a la altura del mensaje que les env a la sociedad que quiere negociaci n di logo y un acuerdo para poner fin a la crisis
3095990 estamos convencidos de que es importante unir a los bolivianos esto fue para unir a oriente y occidente y eso se har juntando a la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado con los estatutos auton micos
3095991 es una obligaci n garantizar este proceso de cambio ahora que el pueblo boliviano expres el cambio del modelo econ mico neoliberal quiero convocar a todos los prefectos a sumarse a la nacionalizaci n de todos los recursos naturales
3095992 este triunfo de la revoluci n democr tico cultural est dedicado a todos los revolucionarios de am rica y el mundo

3095996 est muy mal lo de esta gente no quieren soltar los privilegios dicen que hacen huelga de hambre pero en realidad hacen dieta
3095997 si ac hay otro 1952 es por culpa de ellos por su violencia por su racismo tenemos que seguir avanzando por qu tener miedo hay que ir para adelante porque lo que estamos haciendo es justo
3095998 a partir de ma ana tenemos una correlaci n de fuerzas realistas
3095999 en este pa s hay tres grandes deudas hist ricas a resolver en primer lugar la igualdad entre los pueblos esa herida colonial no curada que estamos resolviendo luego la democratizaci n y descentralizaci n del poder que permita al ciudadano estar m s cerca del poder deuda a la que podemos llamar auton mica por ltimo el desarrollo de una econom a capaz de generar riqueza y distribuci n de recursos en otros pa ses como ee uu y sud frica una sola de estas deudas ha generado guerras civiles en bolivia en cambio se est n resolviendo democr ticamente
3096000 es una nueva pauta para am rica latina en vista de que los peruanos m s que todo siempre nos equivocamos al momento de elegir al presidente de la rep blica presidentes regionales y alcaldes y ser a saludable que se sometan nuestras autoridades a medio mandato y que ser a una oportunidad para que la poblaci n tambi n rectifique su error electoral
3096001 es positivo el triunfo de evo morales por que es un muestra de que es un hombre democr tico y valiente que est defendiendo los recursos naturales de su pa s de las empresas transnacionales
3096002 bueno en nuestro pa s se deben perfeccionar las consultas populares en distintos niveles para que tener control pol tico y social ante las autoridades electas por parte de la poblaci n y debemos buscar los mecanismos eficaces de fiscalizaci n y no emitir normas como la revocatoria que no tienen credibilidad por que los revocadores con el revocado negocian con la voluntad del pueblo
3096003 ser a una buena pr ctica sin embargo no creo que someta o promueva estas pr cticas el presidente alan garc a p rez si se someter a perder a ahora si habr a referendo revocatorio para el presidente regional de puno hern n fuentes no sacar a ni el 6 por que no est trabajando por el desarrollo de la regi n si no por el desarrollo de su proyecto pol tico a futuro

3096006 contribuye a la pacificaci n de la sociedad boliviana y a la preservaci n de la integridad territorial
3096007 esta consulta electoral ha constituido un brillante ejemplo del comportamiento c vico de la ciudadan a en la b squeda del fortalecimiento de sus instituciones democr ticas y la consolidaci n del estado de derecho
3096008 aqu s lo damos orientaci n la comunidad es la soberana
3096009 muchas papeletas son nulas porque los votantes han tachado los recuadros de todos los prefectos opositores a evo que aprobaron estatutos de autonom a
3096010 han pedido a sus oyentes que no votaran o han intentado confundirlos sobre la forma de emitir el voto
3096011 queremos una sola bolivia que aglutine a los nueve departamentos
3096012 estamos convencidos de que es importante unir a los bolivianos del campo y la ciudad de oriente y occidente y esa unidad se har con la nueva constituci n y los estatutos auton micos
3096013 a trabajar por la uni n de los bolivianos y trabajar en conjunto respetando las normas
3096014 ahora bolivia no s lo puede elegir a sus autoridades sino ratificarlas o revocarlas
3096015 el voto consolida el proceso de cambio y por eso quiero decir con mucho respeto que estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de los recursos naturales y en la recuperaci n de nuestras empresas del estado
3096016 legalmente sigo siendo el prefecto de cochabamba vamos a estar dando batalla legal con toda la fuerza y energ a
3096017 le digo a evo morales que yo no estar a celebrando porque el pa s se termin de fracturar y cinco departamentos le dicen no al presidente
3096018 sigo siendo prefecto de cochabamba y ser a un retroceso tremendo volver a tener un prefecto nombrado a dedo
3096019 triunfar en su regi n gracias a la intimidaci n y al reparto de dinero
3096020 me preocupa el pa s desde ma ana cuando habr regiones que no lo van a reconocer a usted
3096021 la cantidad de gente que viene a manifestar su reclamo por el derecho al voto que no se les permiten ejercer
3096022 no alcanz todav a con el esfuerzo que hizo el presidente evo morales para que por fin salga la norma que est frenada en el senado
3096023 podremos hablar de una representatividad mucho mayor de los bolivianos en argentina una vez que se permita el voto en el exterior y con los operativos que haga el organismo electoral de nuestro pa s
3096024 la continuidad del proceso de cambio liderado por el presidente evo morales ayma y el vicepresidente lvaro garc a linera
3096025 logra una consolidaci n de su gobierno pero adem s una mayor legitimizaci n
3096026 seguro va a tener mayor fuerza para poder llevar adelante los cambios profundos y estructurales que ha venido realizando
3096027 este triunfo es trascendental no solamente para bolivia sino para am rica latina

3096034 si bien el presidente ha obtenido una votaci n alta los prefectos que son adversos al gobierno logran una votaci n que legitima sus posiciones y los fortalece

3096302 the pragmatic cso 12 steps to become a pragmatic cso is worth reading for one sentence on page 12 which states its not about technology its about business the even better news is that the book is full of insightful ideas like that on how information should work and how to make it work in todays large enterprise organizations one of the mistakes many security professionals make is that they think of security for its own sake when security is simply meant to support the business cxos could care less about encryption key lengths and operating systems while they dont care about the technical details the people from information security often mistakenly communicate to them in those terms

3096442 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3096456 stars are significantly reducing their rates taking cheaper flights and staying at more budget conscious hotels not motel 6 but not the hyatt either studios are providing significant giveaways we all have to work together in this

3096459 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3096460 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3096461 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3096462 lord help roy to stop being so mean and hateful to everyone so that the rest of us dont have to be mean and hateful back to him

3096467 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3096468 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3096469 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3096474 the response has been tremendous already 200 people signed up to attend the conference
3096475 the power of the jblogosphere taking jblogging to the next level
3096476 the conference is an opportunity for people who are online friends through writing and reading blogs to meet in person for the first time
3096477 there are times when people are more comfortable arguing with and insulting people who are just words on a computer screen when you meet someone in person you tend to judge them more favorably and treat them with more respect
3096478 is an opportunity for people to take time out of their busy schedules and stop and think about what they do why they do it and how they can do it better
3096479 im more interested in the complexities of israeli life than in blogging about aliyah related themes
3096480 at first glance the conference seems stacked in favor of orthodox bloggers with right wing political leanings
3096481 i think what nefesh bnefesh is doing is deceitful a true jewish bloggers conference would be both open to all jewish bloggers and far more balanced
3096482 the first international jewish bloggers convention is open to the entire jewish world
3096483 all official bloggers are welcome and invited to join we dont have a prerequisite if youre orthodox or not if you are on the right or left wing it doesnt matter
3096484 who wants to go listen to some carefully hand picked panel discussion where there are exactly equal numbers of right wing left wing girls boys religious secular sephardi ashkenazi theres no end to that kind of madness
3096485 i have the sense the organizers of the conference were going for pro israel pro aliyah bloggers who also get lots of traffic unfortunately that demographic seems to skew somewhat right wing religious just as the actual aliyah statistics do
3096486 im sure they will more than make up for any disparity in numbers with their active participation
3096487 thats why we say spending must be increased because the fund will not be here forever
3096488 why would any domainer sell his valuable name at a large auction

3096512 crees que hamilton y massa lo haran bien en monaco
3096513 a n no me puedo creer que est en pole
3096514 y encima este es el lugar al que siempre le he tenido pavor el primer d a mis tiempos en el segundo sector no eran nada buenos pero hoy he conseguido poner todo en su lugar para completar una vuelta buena tener un coche bueno sigo sin cre rmelo
3096515 mi primera vuelta no estuvo mal pero vi que que pod a mejorar mis tiempos en un par de curvas y luego me di cuenta que estaba a un par de d cimas de segundo de kimi y lewis
3096516 sab a que pod a mejorar un poco y que ellos tambi n lo har an pero mejor mucho y complet una vuelta perfecta en m naco d nde es casi imposible hacerlo
3096517 mis dos vueltas fueron bien pero probablemente me lo tom con mucha tranquilidad en las primeras curvas
3096518 consegu completar una vuelta buena pero no fue suficiente est bien salir desde la primera l nea de parrilla
3096519 los neum ticos han funcionado bien aunque es algo dif cil completar la primera vuelta con ello eso ha sido lo m s complicado para m
3096520 antes de viajar aqu no est bamos 100 seguros de c mo nos ir a pero parece que hemos dado un buen paso hacia adelante y ahora podremos luchar por la victoria
3096521 una pena haber terminado tercero porque los acontecimientos no han jugado a nuestro favor lo que es f cil que suceda en estas condiciones en la salida fui muy r pido y el coche iba perfecto pero despu s comet un error en la primera curva y perd la posici n respecto a robert despu s de unas vueltas iba detr s de l y sab a que pod a ir m s r pido decidimos cambiar la estrategia pensando que volver a a llover pero result que fue una equivocaci n adem s la radio no funcionaba en algunos momentos de la carrera teniendo en cuenta todo lo que ha pasado estos seis puntos son importantes para el campeonato solo llevamos un tercio del campeonato y aun queda mucho por delante
3096522 estamos muy decepcionados con este resultado que no hay duda de que est por debajo de nuestras expectativas hemos cometido errores que debemos asegurarnos de no volver a repetir y tambi n hemos tomado algunas decisiones estrat gicas que no han salido bien debemos sacar las conclusiones correctas de este fin de semana juzgando sin emoci n hemos demostrado que ramos competitivos en una pista que normalmente no nos iba bien pero no hemos trabajado a nuestro nivel habitual dentro de poco tendremos un reto parecido en montreal donde tuvimos problemas en 2007 tenemos que recuperarnos de esta decepci n
3096523 ayer despu s de una gran calificaci n era f cil predecir una loter a para la carrera de hoy bas ndonos en el tiempo no podemos negar que estamos decepcionados por este resultado tan negativo es el resultado de una combinaci n de errores y de mala suerte empezamos mal con un error en los preparativos de kimi en la parrilla que caus una penalizaci n para el piloto despu s decidimos cambiar la estrategia y nos equivocamos
3096524 al comienzo de la carrera ten a un buen ritmo y sab a que nuestra estrategia estaba funcionando bien pero luego la cambiamos a una parada en boxes y cargamos el coche de combustible para llegar a meta eso fue un error
3096525 en carreras como esta es muy f cil perder por un momento la concentraci n y si frenas un poco sobre la l nea no puedes parar el coche he tenido una carrera complicada y perd la comunicaci n por radio durante unas 20 vueltas por lo que no pude hablar con el equipo y no sab a qu estaba pasando en la prueba

3096534 he hecho algunos errores y el equipo cometi un error y pagamos por ello pero vamos a ir a la pr xima carrera y esperamos poder hacerlo mejor

3096551 we were pretty close in the end we were only five points down with a pretty average performance
3096552 we didnt miss anything big we just didnt have any big hits like were used to
3096553 i dont pay attention to my competition to where we are in the standings
3096554 so i actually had no idea where we were at all until the last dive i felt like we were up there

3096561 tradition is that when the economy goes south so do womens hemlines longer hemlines demand more glamorous hairstyles which are softer not only in cut but also in color
3096562 fall fashions are showing much longer hemlines this year and were seeing much more demand for more feminine hairstyles as well
3096563 tone on tone a softer dimensional color that doesnt have as strong a line of demarcation
3096564 the objective is to achieve a style that doesnt require frequent touch ups which allows one to go longer between appointments
3096565 bangs have taken a back seat recently but theyre on the fashion runway big time this fall
3096566 more of a softer flirty look that offers options in styling they can be worn down swept to the side or blended when worn back
3096567 when the economy goes down everyone in fashion knows that lipstick sales go up
3096568 the theory is women buy more lipstick in brighter colors to cheer themselves up

3096575 our focus has been on trying to attend to barbara and her needs and trying to deal with the shock of losing todd and trying to begin the grieving process as well
3096576 clearly elisabeth was a victim in this as well even though she was physically unscathed he said
3096577 having to deal with this event has been hard for her
3096578 she has shown incredible strength in the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it and there have been a lot of tears and hugs the fact that shes able to get in amongst it and already be able to address what happened is a testament to her strength of character

3096607 one might say that the potential victims have on the one hand a painful sensitivity linked to some childhood trauma and on the other great vitality the abusers attack no the melancholy element but the vital one where they can try to approporiate the vitality they perceive because of their lack of narcissism the victims are paralysed by a rage that is repressed or internalised and prevents them from reacting
3096608 in a wave of maternal feeling they believe that they alone see whats happening they are like missionaries believing they can understand justify and forgive everything convinced that by talking it through theyll find a solution they allow the abuser who refuses to engage in any form of dialogue to effectively checkmate them victims nourish the hope that the other will change and will finally understand and regret the pain he inflicts they eternally hope that their explanations and justifications will solve misunderstandings and refuse to see that because one can intellectually and emotionally grasp a predicament is no reason to put up with it

3096616 ahh hes only half retarded the other half is pretty smart or clever or even genius level
3096617 i have not been given the chance to see the movie
3096618 but ive seen previews read about it and read excerpts of the script by all accounts it is an unchecked assault on the humanity of people with intellectual disabilities an affront to dignity hope and respect

3096625 fantastic misgovernment of the kind we have seen is not an accident nor is it the work of a few bad individuals it is the consequence of triumph by a particular philosophy of government by a movement that understands the liberal state as a perversion and considers the market the ideal nexus of human society this movement is friendly to industry not just by force of campaign contributions but by conviction
3096626 im sorry youre not going to be able to do any of those things because the deficit is so huge that the only thing youre going to be able to do as president the only economic policy youre going to be allowed to have structurally permitted to have is deficit reduction

3096628 last year was more of a traditional top down campaign
3096629 this time were a lean mean grassroots operation looking for more door to door voter contact so they know why its a great plan
3096630 were going for a wide range of sources and different donors
3096631 there are plenty of progressive young transit friendly voters in king county pierce county and snohomish county we are going to explore a lot of options and be creative in the way we reach them
3096632 weve got a presidential election with a heavy turnout expected and with high gas prices demand for transit is at an all time high all across the country
3096633 the sierra club opposed proposition 1 because the additional highway lanes would swamp all benefits of increased transit and worsen global warming
3096634 sound transit phase 2 st2 is a critical piece of our transportation future we are tired of sitting in our cars burning fuel and dollars while watching our time evaporate
3096635 still costs too much does too little and takes too long to implement
3096636 its an absolute lie to say it will fix things right away
3096637 plus you cant double down taxes on a failed strategy not in todays economy there isnt an economist in the world who would tell you this is the time for an expensive ballot proposition
3096638 include spending for roads bridges schools and other public facilities
3096639 the future path of metro rail systems in america is unquestionably upward triggered by congestion spiraling gas prices and citizen demand
3096640 the public has recognized the need for investment and immediate relief
3096641 thats what this measure provides the question is this stalemate or action should we sit back and do nothing hardly any other major city in the nation relies on just buses but light rail can put us back on the map
3096642 i thought they reported in good condition and they seemed to retain a lot from the spring
3096643 the last few days hes made some long throws and got a little achy yesterday i dont see any reason why he wouldnt be able to play tomorrow
3096644 its a combination im not going to say were moving mclouth out of the three hole
3096645 certain days the way our lineup looks like today he fits better in the lead we know he can lead off and hes had a lot of success lately when i sit down and look at the lineup see how it best looks the balance of it today right or wrong it looked better to have him lead off
3096646 the last thing was to make sure he was swinging a lot looks fine hitting just being able to grip the ball to where he can throw it across the field he went out early and did that he said he felt it but he was good enough to be able to play
3096647 i know you probably think im a little bit different
3096648 but australia is not that much different its pretty similar to the states
3096649 pretty much my dad and i were walking around one day in a park and saw the game being played
3096650 hes got the makings hes got the mentality hes got the stuff
3096651 when i get tired i look at him because hes still going going hard every day
3096652 we like to get fired up for sports we are very competitive as a country
3096653 i wanted to grab sheffield as he was running around the bases
3096654 i was fired up i was staring at him all the way around and i was angry
3096655 like the bullpen guys said to me you kind of expect its going to happen sooner or later
3096656 well i wouldnt expect it to happen at all because i dont see myself giving up a home run to anyone
3096657 its just a thing i got stuck in my head
3096658 i cant call him and say hey i pitched i did this i wait for him to call me
3096659 ive had to work hard to get back up here and really just mentally every day keep going
3096660 theres a lot more to it than going out there and pitching theres a daily routine and just sticking to what you know is going to work for you
3096661 i expected him to actually be playing free in the game he played and had to come out but it didnt work out i feel very confident in castro

3096756 next week the apa may adopt a new report on the link between abortion and health problems such as depression
3096757 new research from norway reconfirms what women across america already know all too well abortion doesnt end your problems it creates new ones the apa needs to ignore political pressure and report the truth about abortions painful aftermath
3096758 abortion is not just a life terminating experience for the baby its a life altering one for the mother
3096759 the apa cannot continue to ignore study after study and pretend that eliminating a child from your life is consequence free it will be interesting to see if a pro abortion bias will continue to trump science and womens realities when the psychologists meet next week

3096770 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3096771 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3096772 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy
3096773 what people really like to do is sit in living rooms and talk
3096774 the point is we have to stop being afraid of talking about how to pay for the things we say we want
3096775 having the president campaign for you is a very big deal
3096776 i think its important for the people of southern arizona to know if the senator supports the president of the united states on issues
3096777 he has embraced one of the worst presidents in american history
3096778 it seems to me a reasonable assumption to make that who your friends are would dictate where you are on policy
3096779 everything i do here in d c has a bipartisan approach
3096780 tim bee has earned a stellar reputation for getting things done on a bipartisan basis
3096781 a political moderation is accompanied by social moderation and candidates who appear too shrill too harsh appear out of the mainstream
3096782 what republicans have going for them in the district is that they have an a list candidate who is the senate majority leader
3096783 i think bee will do better than graf because hes a lot better known and a lot more moderate then the individual who ran last time
3096784 she hasnt taken on anything overtly controversial that she can be attacked on
3096785 i dont see how republicans go after her in any major way
3096786 early on she wisely made the calculation that immigration could be a problem for her
3096787 gabby giffords apparently thinks that arizona voters are willing to sit around and wait while their representative goes on vacation as the cost of gasoline continues to soar

3096795 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3096796 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3096797 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3096798 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3096799 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3096800 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3096801 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3096802 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3096803 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3096804 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3096805 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3096806 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3096807 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3096808 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3096809 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3096810 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3096811 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3096812 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3096813 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3096814 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3096815 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3096816 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3096817 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3096818 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3096819 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3096820 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3096821 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3096822 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3096823 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3096824 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3096825 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3096826 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3096827 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

3096832 serina is summoned by the nuns to help with the an incident at the craft show the nuns booth has been ransacked by thieves and their broken tent is bearing down on them oh good could this be the work of the main antagonist is the plot starting oh im so excited but serina isnt she is fucking put out about doing her job mind you shes been gone for hours she had time to go slave shopping create a wardrobe for dom have sex with him eat lunch buy some lemonweed and go scabbard shopping really is it so much to ask to check up on your charges

3097317 given that there is a belated awareness in some sections of the mainstream media of the need to hold the holder of the post of mayor of london to account and given that mr paddick himself evaluates his own position as being in many ways unique relying as he does on the fact of his police career and most importantly given his public disagreement with the current commissioner of police on a number of issues all to do with points of principle isnt it incumbent on mr paddick to explain why he has contradicted so many of his partys spokespersons on crossrail and how in this context he thinks he can carry out any policies that counter the position of his party in the conceptual eventuality of his getting elected mayor of london

3097381 mr loftis is a contributor to bob murphys senate campaign while also sitting in a position to act on bob murphys candidacy for the vacant payne county judgeship unfortunately mr murphys decision has created a clear conflict of interest for mr loftis
3097382 although mr loftis has done nothing wrong the right and honorable result of mr murphys dual office seeking is for mr loftis to immediately recuse himself from the judicial nominating commissions nomination process for the payne county associate district judge position
3097383 and given that former and possibly future judge murphy has raised nearly 70 percent of his campaign funds from trial lawyers who may one day be trying cases before him again its clear these and other potential donors could feel pressure from murphy as the campaign progresses

3097426 sex outside of marriage is okay as long as you are practicing safe sex
3097427 same sex unions are normal and they should have the same status as male female marriages
3097428 let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them
3097429 for ye were sometime darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them
3097430 sexual intercourse between a man and a woman who are not married to each other
3097431 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god
3097432 now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
3097433 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these
3097434 for this is the will of god even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel body in sanctification and honor not in lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which do not know god
3097435 be ye therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor
3097436 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and
3097437 to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband
3097438 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
3097439 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god mortify restrain your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry
3097440 if god gave me this body shouldnt i be able to enjoy it
3097441 marriage is honorable among all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge
3097442 well isnt it still better to masturbate than to commit fornication
3097443 every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death
3097444 verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
3097445 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
3097446 it is unfair for god to demand sexual purity from us after giving us sexual drives that seem to overwhelm us
3097447 well i agree with all of this in my head but living it out on a day to day basis is another story
3097448 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
3097449 drink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out of thine own well let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe let her breasts satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love
3097450 therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and they shall become one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed
3097451 one who practices habitual customary unlawful indulgence of lust fornication or adultery
3097452 know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of a harlot god forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh
3097453 can a man take fire to his bosom and his clothes not be burned
3097454 let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof
3097455 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments
3097456 if you say that you are a follower of christ yet you are out in the world fornicating and carrying on like all of the lost people of the world than just maybe you are fooling yourself and you are not really a child of gods
3097457 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
3097458 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
3097459 let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy on him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon
3097460 he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy
3097461 but whereunto shall i liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned unto you and ye have not lamented

3097463 we started writing new songs for this album the first week of january while simultaneously planning a mid west tour of america in february and recording our
3097464 we jumped right back into the studio to work on forever more with terry while setting up a tour of american festival shows in july and august playing alongside bands such as matchbox twenty the wallflowers queensr che kiss and judas priest its great that we can play with any band of any music genre because weve never been pigeon holed into a style or label of music throughout our career
3097465 forever more demonstrates this idea of writing songs in a diverse fashion the title track is one of our deeper cuts complete with heavy lyrics de tuned riffs and acoustic interludes while i wanna live is one of our more uplifting songs that bounces musically and delivers a lyrical message that suggests living life to the fullest
3097466 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3097467 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3097468 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3097469 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3097470 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3097471 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3097472 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3097473 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials

3097573 i dont think that america is ready for anything new
3097574 my friends that i talk to feel we dont think we are ready i think we need to just skip this vote and keep going like we usually do with a white older male
3097575 i do not believe the majority of appalachian blue collar working class white people are ready for that
3097576 what we know is that he obama cant win in alabama and mississippi and louisiana and probably south carolina and georgia
3097577 but in the areas where it is marginal you could say western pennsylvania it is also southwestern ohio and a few other places you are dealing with this problem of the white working class vote
3097578 especially in the middle of the country people still have the background of racism and it might be more subconscious that they just do not vote for him but they dont think it is because of that
3097579 i have lived in new york and new jersey and i believe new york and new jersey can but i do not know about any other part of america

3097692 de verdad disminuy esta pr ctica no se denuncia por miedo a mayores represalias o se ha sofisticado la forma de tortura

3097698 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3097699 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3097700 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3097701 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3097702 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3097703 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3097704 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
3097705 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen
3097706 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3097707 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory we should move ahead with the resolution despite russian veto threats and submit russia to the court of world public opinion

3097726 the russians say that your troops have killed some 2 000 people in ossetia do you have any estimate about how many people have been killed and injured
3097727 and we only responded when after many hours of artillery barrage after a unilateral ceasefire declared by us that killed lots of people by the way because we wouldnt respond on our side
3097728 then when i heard around 11 30 11 50 p m that 150 russian tanks are entering our sovereign territory from this place there is a very mountain you know long mountainous tunnel called the rocky tunnel into the georgian territory our forces were stationed somewhere here so when they got entered the only way we could get them was to respond with artillery fire to stop mass land invasion of the sort that happened to afghanistan and czechoslovakia in 1968
3097729 georgian president mikheil saakashvili seems to care less about these people than about asserting that they live in georgian territory
3097730 saakashvili is a famously volatile risk taker veering between war monger and peacemaker democrat and autocrat on several occasions international officials have pulled him back from the brink on a visit to washington in 2004 he received a tongue lashing from then secretary of state colin powell who told him to act with restraint two months ago he could have triggered a war with his other breakaway province of abkhazia by calling for the expulsion of russian peacekeepers from there but european diplomats persuaded him to step back this time he has yielded to provocation and stepped over the precipice

3097780 i think peoples expectations got too high because they began to believe that these prices couldnt drop and almost the beginning of bubble mentality had taken place over the last year or so
3097781 no one knows how far prices will drop but the fact the world economy is slowing is finally getting recognized in the marketplace
3097782 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year

3097790 using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west
3097791 we need an agreement between the georgian leaders we dont trust them anymore and the two breakaway republics that military force will never be used again

3097820 all is not as quiet as it appears and a major announcement will take place in the next 7 10 days that will define sundins future
3097821 however i dont think the teams have the slightest idea what team he will pick
3097822 sundin is playing this year in the nhl however we have yet to see the scope of the bidding at this point since sundins statement in early july many more teams are in the game he is a high powered addition and certain teams do believe he is the missing piece
3097823 look out for colorado with mats i am not convinced that sakic and sundin arent talking or in on something together
3097824 it is a tough sell to let him back to the preds if for some reason he does decide to return the preds fans and the people in tennessee feel completely betrayed here they will let him go for almost nothing based on principle there is a reason terrell owens has never played for the titans that game wouldnt fly here
3097825 two big time arguably future all star forwards are on the table but there is more to it than that dig deeper and you will find another team is trying to snag the montreal kid and may have a better package to offer

3097839 mobile phones are without question the most underutilized computing platform in the world
3097840 despite the fact that billions of phones are able to run applications industry research shows that less than 5 percent of mobile subscribers around the world are actually running third party applications on their phones cascada mobile believes there are two main reasons why this number is so low first that conditions for mobile application development are a huge challenge limiting the number of mobile developers and applications and second that there are few resources for finding applications that are of interest to subscribers the breeze platform and breeze apps portal solve both halves of this mobile application problem

3097848 no redistricting proposal is ever perfect but anything would be an improvement over the current situation
3097849 i am so happy my dream to see india win an individual gold medal in the olympics before i die has been fulfilled
3097850 bindras feat makes me feel like i have got my olympics medal back his success is an inspiration to young sportspersons and especially the olympics team there to do their best if you ask me bindra should be awarded the bharat ratna once he is back home
3097851 i have always told people that one cant say how many medals can be won but that doesnt mean that you are any less hardworking abhinav worked hard for four years for this one day and he did it
3097852 i would also say that abhinav had luck on his side he went with an aggressive mindset first and then became defensive which worked for him lets just hope that we get more medals those like badminton player saina nehwal for instance are doing very well
3097853 its a great day in the history of indian sports finally we have won an individual gold the last time we saw a gold medal was when the indian hockey team won it in 1980 the youth in the country have got a new icon in abhinav bindra i hope they will now be drawn more towards olympic sports
3097854 bindra has done the country proud this is far bigger than any other sporting achievement it is difficult to compare indias sporting laurels but i think this one has eclipsed all other feats
3097855 it is very difficult for any indian sportsperson to win medals in international competition leave alone olympics because they have to perform under pressure and with no resources available it is against heavy odds bindras effort will inspire others to win more laurels they will do much better in times to come
3097856 this is a proud moment for any indian a gold medal in olympics is the biggest glory any sportsperson can think of i am sure his family must be very proud of him today
3097857 he bindra has put in a lot of effort to achieve this success i am very happy
3097858 we in punjab are proud of abhinav bindras remarkable feat we hope that his performance is a morale booster to other youngsters to do well in sports
3097859 i sincerely hope my medal changes the face of indias olympic sports
3097860 for me life will go on as usual but i sincerely hope olympic sports get a leg up its not a priority back home and i hope more focus is paid to these events
3097861 i entered the final as fourth which means i had to go all out for it thats why i was so aggressive and it paid off in the end
3097862 i was not bothered about history all i wanted to was to shoot aggressively and score well and thats exactly what i did
3097863 i started my sighting on a poor note but soon things started going my way and it remained so i guess this was my day
3097864 i worked hard left home and trained in germany it only proves that if you keep working hard you would have your day someday and fortunately it was my day today
3097865 my parents family and coaches stood by me all along and i owe it to them
3097866 ive been feeling constant pain for the last two weeks
3097867 ive been on pain killers for the last six days i took four this morning
3097868 its unfortunate timing its very bad but theres nothing i can do
3097869 win of bindra has brought hope of winning more medals in the ensuing olympic games in beijing and it is greate victory from one of the youngest sport person of indian squad in olympics
3097870 winning an olympic gold medal is something really great and my congratulations on behalf of the indian cricket team congratulations to abhinav bindra for a fantastic effort
3097871 its a great effort to become a world champion and winning an individual medal in a sport is a greater achievement
3097872 we are feeling on top of the world and we cannot put our joy in words he has done the nation proud and also his city chandigarh
3097873 my son has proved that singh is king in a real sense he has brought laurels for the whole sikh community and for the whole nation
3097874 he has been in some fine form over the last few months and i guess he will face a stiff competition in beijing his event is in the morning so we all will be glued to our tv sets
3097875 abhinav could not forget athens for a long time it was bit later in the finals that he realized that he was standing on a faulty board but it was too late he broke the olympic record but was not satisfied with the seventh place finish
3097876 if you could not get a goal from that you did not deserve to be on my team
3097877 at this distant date i still remember the circumstances in which india took the field on may 26 to win the highest honour in world hockey i was ill and running a high temperature which persisted all throughout the game that day our manager a b rosser coined a slogan for us do or die i was a soldier by profession and when the countrys honour was at stake there was no alternative but to march boldly into the battlefield
3097878 this is not a game of hockey but magic dhyan chand is in fact the magician of hockey
3097879 it is not only the number of goals that dhyan chand scores but the way he scores them
3097880 perfection is perilous for it tempts the gods for once this was proved wrong for even the god of weather paid tribute to the genius of the indian players rain clouds which had threatened to ruin the game vanished into the blue and thousands of spectators spent a happy hour marvelling at the incomparable artistry of the indian team
3097881 is the match really over i feel that i have been watching the indians play for only five minutes
3097882 on august 11 we met the united states in the final match of the tournament it was a cakewalk for us and we won by 24 goals to 1 a few american players even suggested that to make it a contest the indians ought to play left handed or wear snow shoes at the interval we were leading by 10 goals to nil incidentally the 24 goals was a world record i scored 8 goals roop singh 10 gurmeet singh 5 and pinnegar 1 the lone american goal was scored by bodlington
3097883 the all india field hockey team which g d sondhi brought to los angeles to defend their 1928 olympic title was like a typhoon out of the east they trampled under their feet and all but shoved out of the olympic stadium the eleven players representing the united states
3097884 the americans looked liked a junior team and were disjointed the indian forwards made lightening flashes and both dhyan and roop were an inspiration to the side
3097885 i am delighted to learn of the splendid victory of our hockey team please give all members of the side my warm congratulations upon retaining the world championship
3097886 dhyan chand a supremely unselfish artist who never held on to the ball for even a second more than necessary was seen in a rare selfish mode he shouted to us direct all passes to me i will take care from there on
3097887 a flick of the wrist a quick glance of his eyes a sharp turn and then another turn and dhyan chand was through
3097888 with a flick of the wrist a quick glance of his eyes a sharp turn and then another turn and dhyan chand was through
3097889 such was the scene on all stations right up to peshawar where the train reached more than four hours behind the schedule
3097890 once he went to a tournament in ahmedabad and they turned him away not knowing who he was
3097891 you are doubtless aware that i am a common man
3097892 such was the scene on all stations right up to peshawar where the train reached more than four hours behind the schedule
3097893 london is the historic home of cricket a sport which espouses the olympic ideal of fair play through the spirit of the game now enshrined in the official rules by mcc
3097894 hosting the olympic games in 2012 provides london an ideal opportunity to showcase cricket to a much wider global audience and in return to increase interest the olympic games amongst nations that dont engage as fully with traditional athletics
3097895 let me make this very clear to inquirer ownership and management
3097896 you are killing the paper you might as well just burn the place down youre setting a match to it this is insane even the slowest most curmudgeonly most backward in your dying suffering industry would not be this stup anymore it is suicide it is murder
3097897 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3097898 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3097899 asta a mai castigat si ieri si alataieri nu se mai satura
3097900 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3097901 nat rlich will ich wieder aufs feld aber wie ich immer gesagt habe plaxico burress muss auf plaxico burress acht geben
3097902 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3097903 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3097904 not only do we need more innovative products but we need to be able to tell a story around that product
3097905 we dont care about you what youre doing or what youre trying to achieve
3097906 so you think you know more about cars that click and clack the tappet brothers
3097907 when starbucks first made their deal to switch from t mobile hotspots to at amp t i saw some strange things in a few of their stores the presence of two separate wifi hotspots in a single starbucks sometimes gave my pc pause as it tried to connect to one of the two at random
3097908 yet there does not seem to be much strategy involved except to keeping exes and camera crews apart at the party
3097909 so what makes this story all the more amusing is that the packers needed a strategic communications consultant who has the exact opposite skill set and demeanor that mr fleischer possesses or has shown the world he holds somehow this organization was lucky enough to finally diffuse the crisis and trade brett away to the hapless jets but now it easy to understand why packers for so long during this summer good ol ari must have been leading the communications effort

3097946 not at all that was our impartial and probably unanimous judgment we saw attorneys hold back tears and weep alongside their clients we saw judges prosecutors clerks and marshals do their duty sometimes with a heavy heart but always with a particular solemnity not accorded to the common criminals theyre used to encountering
3097947 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty yet they have no choice but to plead out
3097948 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number

3098392 russia has a very clear strategy and would prefer europes gas to go via russia and not via independent countries
3098393 there is no definite attempt to disrupt supplies but it is not unhelpful to russia that there is unrest
3098394 the shine hasnt quite come off the azeri star just yet as it is unclear quite how severe or long lasting the interruption in supplies through this corridor will be
3098395 nor is it clear yet what risks now hang over this pipeline
3098396 for europe the lesson is clear nabucco and related projects cannot be left entirely to the private companies caspian resources need protection from governments
3098397 we put a really low probability on the pipelines being affected it would require a significant escalation of the conflict
3098398 i would not get too hysterical about it if the pipeline to ceyhan does not resume work within two weeks it will happen within three weeks the turks will raise security the russians are unlikely to intervene and all will be fine again
3098399 there is an underlying concern from some people about the autonomy of institutional decision making in academic affairs
3098400 the working group understands why that is important but universities as members of the ncaa already have ceded some of their autonomy in that regard and we believe that in this case we need national standards that are measurably connected with success
3098401 you cant use the academic success of student athletes as a way to save money
3098402 diplomats at the highest levels from the united states the european union and the united nations must become directly involved in mediating this military conflict and beginning a process to resolve the political disputes over the territories of south ossetia and abkhazia a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
3098403 russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states of america
3098404 russian actions in clear violation of international law have no place in 21st century europe
3098405 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3098406 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia georgias territorial integrity must be respected
3098407 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing the shelling of peacekeeping forces by georgian artillery and aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia
3098408 senaki is one of the places where such actions were under way
3098409 they have advanced in dozens of apcs armoured personnel carriers and are now in senaki
3098410 if the ultimatum is rejected all necessary enforcement measures will be used
3098411 we are not going to surrender any arms to the russians
3098412 the biggest decision we had to make on the first day was to clear the area and create a collapse zone around the severely damaged 7 world trade center a 47 story building heavily involved in fire
3098413 this war has pushed georgia further away not just from europe but also complicates the nato council in december
3098414 italy maintains that we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to russian prime minister vladimir putins position
3098415 but this makes nato expansion much less likely the last thing the united states needs now is another front thats exactly what russia is taking advantage of
3098416 saakashvili is playing his media game for the conscience of the western world the price is high but he is very convincing
3098417 no one in nato wants to be dragged into a war in the caucasus because of saakashvilis miscalculation
3098418 sampling frequency should be at least five to ten times as high as the highest frequency component of the signal
3098419 the verdict in the first war crimes trial at guant namo bay cuba is in one poorly educated yemeni with an impish sense of humor and two little girls is guilty of supporting terrorism by driving osama bin laden
3098420 downplayed the significance of hamdans conviction and made a flattering sketch of his personality as if he was harmless and the government overzealous in prosecuting him the verdict in the first war crimes trial at

3098436 dear it is good to call us all born again christians to prayer god knows we need the encouragement but i have to disagree with you in this cause for prayer first and foremost obama is not a muslim neither is he a christian mc cain is not also our present president is not if we look at the life of our saviour he did not go to war nor kill the innocent in gods name we are no better than the muslim jihad who kill in the name of allah it is really sad when we as peacemakers agree with wars sending troops to kill and maim hundreds of men women and children we should all take a long hard look on jesus life and teachings do not compromise and keep to gods word will i pray certainly but not in the way you suggest i will pray that gods will be done in our lives the lives of our leaders present and future and his will be done for america if we really know our god nothing takes him by surprise so i will pray gods will be done whatever that will be yes i will pray as i have been that obama mc cain and all those that do not know the saviour will come to the lord

3098442 pentagon officials believe the massive israeli air force exercise in early june first reported by the new york times was done to prepare for a possible attack
3098443 therefore we also since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily ensnares us and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross
3098444 there are literally millions of people throughout the world who are devoted to the worship of mary
3098445 my position is messianic jews and gentile christians stay away
3098446 but why did not men of god in the past who wrote church history commentaries theological textbooks concordances and sermons teach the same
3098447 i must point out that the shooting incident that occurred here has national interest hence we decided to refer this case to the high court
3098448 i want to plead with our community members to be patient people should know that there is no need for us to rush in order to finalise any case
3098449 my position is messianic jews and gentile christians stay away
3098450 when approaching dispensationalists of any kind be prepared to get a tiny taste of what jesus experienced when talking with the religious leaders of israel and believe me this really hurts when you are expecting christian fellowship
3098451 but why did not men of god in the past who wrote church history commentaries theological textbooks concordances and sermons teach the same
3098452 undeniably the bad church people behind it supporting it are also really dangerous easily out of control etc they clearly support the devil in all this too

3098468 at this moment there are new yorkers who are being denied justice simply because they are poor
3098469 we look forward to a full resolution to this urgent problem but with lives on the line we cant afford to sit back and wait immediate action is necessary
3098470 the public defense crisis in new york is unfair both to defendants and to the lawyers who are charged with representing them
3098471 defendants are unfairly given second rate justice because they cannot afford to pay private lawyers and public defense attorneys are not given the resources tools and training they need to do right by their clients
3098472 when innocent people go to jail the real criminals continue to roam free
3098473 we look for work that really has something to say that is very consistent well developed challenging and will operate well in the book format we will take a gamble in a way that a lot of publishers might not be able to in part because of our not for profit status we can find ways to make it work
3098474 theyre sketches and often theyre based on a movie or part of a movie something we saw on the street something we saw in a book and its a riff on something
3098475 there are story lines that run through some of the globes that connect them together we have explored themes for periods of time and we were influenced by things that were happening in this country or in the area where we lived or in our lives
3098476 we were approached by aperture initially they asked us if wed be interested in doing a childrens book and we said no even though children love the globes because children are very attracted to dark stories aperture came back with a proposal to basically document the work weve been doing for the last five years 2002 2007 which is a series of travelers almost 200 they had seen that the work had evolved and grown and became richer and they thought that there was enough material to do a book the danger with books is that you can have this certain amount of redundancy and actually deaden the experience or the power of the work if it doesnt change up and develop during the course of the book and we didnt want that deadness to happen apertures approach was to not make it as a typical art book with an art critics or an art historians comments but continue with the spirit of the work into the text that was a pretty original idea
3098477 we all realized the work lent itself beautifully to the narrative space of a book and that the book could reach beyond their considerable fine art fan base for travelers i suggested an initial format edit and sequence to the artists got jonathan lethem involved and hired a designer patricia fabricant and worked with them all to get to something everyone liked i first sequenced the work by separating it into categories and created a very loose narrative arc just a subjective starting point from there we talked and shuffled things around and created a story together that felt right its not meant to be linear of course its more a kind of dream logic and very much subject to interpretation and we had to make some hard decisions about how to package the work
3098478 i would have written a shorter letter but i did not have the time
3098479 i mean im no clara bow but at least i own some of her pictures
3098480 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

3098497 george w bush lied about 9 11 and exploited the lives of murdered americans in order to push a political agenda since the inception of the war bush and his administration share involvement in a multitude of alleged war crimes and they are responsible for unnecessary deaths overseas in addition to recklessly and clumsily pushing the united states into war bushs policies squandered our inherited surplus in order to appease the rich while neglecting to care for the needs of americans see katrina rich poor gap etc barack obama will keep us from hitting rock bottom if were not already there and help restore our credibility in the world
3098498 our nation is safer because we elected george w bush liberal allegations of impropriety in the white house amount to propaganda that has inspired paranoia and fear over non issues see fisa kucinich impeachment water boarding our efforts in iraq must continue or well have to fight the terrorists at home or worse head back to iraq to finish the job further if we do not get the job done all credibility will be lost john mccain is the only candidate with the courage and experience to get the job done
3098499 george w bush is a bum who couldnt find iraq on a map much less understand the dire financial consequences of war that are threatening to destroy our economy the war is costly and our children are indebted to china mexico and others thanks to our lack of foresight obama will make matters worse hes already advocating a larger war in afghanistan and intends to raise taxes to pay for another senseless war and increased social spending john mccain is set to continue along bushs path we may as well stay home on election day unless of course more americans take seriously the candidacy of insert favorite independent or libertarian candidate here

3098503 we believe the seabird deaths the scientists recorded might be just the tip of the iceberg
3098504 it suggests that around 18 000 seabirds may be killed annually in this fishery alone
3098505 we are privileged to become a birdlife species champion and help bring attention to the plight of spoon billed sandpiper
3098506 birds conservation has always been based on voluntary efforts and contributions from bird lovers and enthusiasts and represents a major pillar of birdlife internationals work
3098507 this news will form an important step towards the establishment of a national monitoring scheme that is hoped to be updated regularly it will help build local capacity through mobilizing interested people to contribute their records
3098508 so what i did was to write to the minister of agriculture attorney general and even the prime minister and none of them replied the kind of damage was estimated at over 172 000

3098521 google can say they are not in the content business but if they are paying people and distributing and archiving their work it is getting harder to make that case
3098522 they are competing for talent for advertisers and for users

3098524 if i am a content provider and i depend upon google as a mechanism to drive traffic to me should i fear that they may compete with me in the future
3098525 publishers desire to reduce their unsold inventory levels appear connected to greater use of ad networks and therefore to lower cpms

3098619 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3098620 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3098621 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3098622 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3098632 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3098633 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3098657 small decreases in lung function during very high pollution days
3098658 the majority of students on the other hand who didnt have respiratory problems were not affected
3098659 but all students coughed slightly more on high pollution nights
3098660 i think its important that we get a balance between understanding the effects of air pollution on health and not over emphasising them
3098661 we are very proud of this study because it is the first time that anyone has really tried to look that closely at a group of people like this
3098662 its not looking at the chronic effects how lung function changes over time

3098668 but i said you know what this is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts
3098669 honestly in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got like a super charge and took it from there it was unreal
3098670 i dont know if im confident but were hopeful that we will and i understand weve narrowed it down to at least a smaller group of people
3098671 my dilemma is that i only have a vague image of who it was who was talking to me and id hate to pin it on the wrong person but you know if you see faces again they can revive memories so well just have to see
3098672 were just quietly and methodically working our way through it
3098673 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3098674 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3098675 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3098676 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3098677 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting
3098678 ive been having a few problems with my breaststroke and its taking a lot more out of me than im used to its not as efficient
3098679 i didnt have any forearms on that last length i dont even want to see what the split was because i know it was really bad 38 98sec the fifth fastest of the heat
3098680 i did have problems with it in my 400m but one length of breaststroke is a lot better than two lengths i knew i could pull the one length down but just coming home it was too tough
3098681 the relay doesnt consist of any breaststroke so im pretty excited at the same time ive got three other girls counting on me im leading off im going to give it everything and im pretty sure we can do something special
3098682 weve got two rookies at the end of the relay theyre pretty fresh but theyre really confident and i cant wait to see them swim as well
3098683 four years ago in athens 2 13 would have been close to a medal so its pretty amazing that 2 13 doesnt even make the semifinals here
3098684 im happy with my race i got a new zealand record but a bit gutted that i didnt make the semi and also because i didnt finish the race how i wanted to
3098685 im pretty sure i could do a 2 12 and make the semi tonight just the end of the race it wasnt my night

3098689 we dont expect that ever to have to be paid

3098703 it was like he has signed his own death warrant
3098704 his wife lived behind the main house with her thai boyfriend every time we went to visit she would come out and scream and order us away this is my house this is my land
3098705 ian knew that he was going to be murdered he had already complained that while he was away she had put something inside a beer in his fridge
3098706 he had felt ill so he sent the beer away for analysis to a local hospital he was awaiting the results
3098707 but it was an open secret in the area that ian was going to be murdered but she had a secret police lover
3098708 when i recently went home to birmingham a policeman told me perhaps your friend will not be alive when you come back
3098709 so when i went to his house on sunday and saw his car was there and the house locked up i knew then his time had come his wife came out shouting at me and my wife to go away we decided to call the police
3098710 ian was a nice and charming man always helping others
3098711 but secretly he was broke and he had nowhere to go once his home had been taken away from him
3098712 he told us all he was going to be murdered and quite frankly we believed him and thought so too
3098713 friends had brought him a stun gun a tazer to use to protect himself we wanted him to go home to england but he was spending his last pennies trying to get his property back he was due in court today
3098714 for the last three months he had been a prisoner in his own house we have been bringing him food but he has been living on mashed potatoes
3098715 ian beestons wife and a thai friend from petchabun province somchit janong 48 have both been arrested for her murder we have assured the british embassy that the investigation will be thorough
3098716 if youre going to have a go at him why not have a go at me

3098801 our goal with soa is that where possible every interface will be implemented as a web service
3098802 but we are transitioning out of a mainframe environment and wanted a standard application that we could deploy quickly without much customization
3098803 we were facing challenges resulting from our heterogeneous sometimes outdated systems and the fact that structures and responsibilities were decentralized and not standardized
3098804 soa with sap is a real business process enabler it allows us to implement new processes new ways of collecting information and new ways of monitoring processes ensuring optimum quality control and transparency

3098850 ive been teaching political science and public policy for almost 30 years and increasingly ive become so disturbed by the assumption that people are self interested
3098851 i think the help your neighbor ethic is the closest thing we have to a universal moral value
3098852 the vast majority of people who get any kind of public or private help dont want it theyre ashamed when they take it and they take it almost always because they need to support their kids or their sick parents
3098853 i think we have a moral obligation to help people who are suffering and thats unconnected to whatever faith you hold or dont hold
3098854 i kept being so angry at the phrase personal responsibility because it was hurled at people and meant take care of yourself and dont be a burden on any one else for most people personal responsibility means taking responsibility for the world around you you notice someone lying on the side of the road you take responsibility

3098871 happiness is something you decide on ahead of time whether i like my room or not doesnt depend on how the furniture is arranged its how i arrange my mind i already decided to love it its a decision i make every morning when i wake up i have a choice i can spend the day in bed recounting the difficulty i have with the parts of my body that no longer work or get out of bed and be thankful for the ones that do
3098872 each day is a gift and as long as my eyes open ill focus on the present moment of the new day and all the happy memories ive stored away
3098873 old age is like a bank account you withdraw from what youve put in

3098881 our evidence suggests that the key factor is being outdoors and that it does not matter if that time is spent in having a picnic or in playing sport
3098882 both will protect a childs eyes from growing excessively which is the major cause of myopia
3098883 we have not yet established why being outside is protective
3098884 but a likely candidate is the high levels of light experienced outside compared to inside studies in animals suggest that retinal dopamine is released in response to light and dopamine is known to be able to block eye growth

3098886 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3098887 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3098888 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3098889 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3098890 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3098891 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3098892 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3098893 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3098894 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3098895 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3098896 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3098897 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time

3098926 as for the claim that the gospels are accurate anyone who says that simply has not undertaken a critical reading of them come on this is a preposterous statement you mean to tell me that you actually believe that throughout all of recorded history no one has ever undertaken a critical reading of the gospels i find that extremely hard to believe but then again in your eyes i am a christian and christians are never right look at the first page of the gospel according to matthew and count how many generations from david to joseph then look at the gospel according to luke and do the same there are 28 generations in matthew and 43 in luke other than the names david and joseph only three names match how can there be such a gross inaccuracy in the word of god
3098927 scholar or not anyone who says that the gospels are accurate histories is just being irresponsible
3098928 a record of the genealogy of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham
3098929 now jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry he was the son so it was thought of joseph
3098930 and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called christ
3098931 the husband of mary of whom feminine genitive jesus was born

3098956 to chastise violence outright to condemn it as bad is an ideological operation par excellence a mystification which collaborates in rendering invisible the fundamental forms of social violence
3098957 abu ghraib was not simply a case of american arrogance towards a third world people in being submitted to humiliating tortures the iraqi prisoners were effectively initiated into american culture
3098958 all hitlers actions were fundamentally reactions he acted so that nothing would really change he acted to prevent the communist threat of a real change his targeting of the jews was ultimately an act of displacement in which he avoided the real enemy the core of capitalist social relations themselves

3098973 alongside the old idea of design as the drawing of objects that are then to be built or manufactured there are many new ideas of what it is all very different designing as the process of devising not individual products but whole systems or environments such as airports transportation hypermarkets educational curricula broadcasting schedules welfare schemes banking systems computer networks design as participation the involvement of the public in the decision making process design as creativity which is supposed to be potentially present in everyone design as an educational discipline that unites arts and science and perhaps can go further than either and now the idea of designing without a product as a process or way of living in itself

3099024 youll find varied interpretations of the laws passed with the spirit to encourage investment in business and create employment opportunities the governments offered the opportunity and people just seized it
3099025 we cant do anything when different governments gave them opportunities to whiten black money and they did it legally
3099026 were following the existing laws we cant bypass the law when it restricts us to go into some matters
3099027 another problem in dealing with cases relating to nbr is that its the first time people are ever charged with issues concerning tax and some confusion still lies with the nbr laws even in india example of dealing with such cases is rare and a very few of such examples can be found in the subcontinent
3099028 so it has become a must to get direction from the apex court to reduce confusion and ensure that the issue is dealt properly
3099029 investigations show black money whitening schemes only came in as help to the corrupt to have their ill gotten wealth clean the schemes encouraged them every year
3099030 its not possible to come out successful in the drive against graft when various governments over the years passed laws helping the corrupt whiten ill gotten property instead of investigating sources of their income
3099031 not only in case of shah alam many former lawmakers and ministers in their tax returns showed such imaginary donors and donation but acc investigations in many cases found that none in those names ever lived in the areas mentioned
3099032 shah alam has his own ways to encroaching land sometimes it was keeping contact with government high ups and sometimes making use of goons to force people sell their land sometimes he even forced people to sell land at a lower price
3099033 a long stretch of our border mainly the border in the remote hilly terrains of chittagong hill tracks cht with india and myanmar desperately requires security mechanisms immediately
3099034 our focal point of discussion was to assess the us proposal and the steps through which we can enhance overall security at the border by increasing the capabilities of our border security force
3099035 goods including fish and clothes are being exported to the us without scanning and this is the reason for their us concern

3099037 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
3099038 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 metres were incredible
3099039 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3099040 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
3099041 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3099042 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
3099043 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3099044 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
3099045 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
3099046 i dont see any problem with the emergency if political parties are allowed to campaign freely hold rallies and processions and people can cast their votes freely to choose their candidates
3099047 i did not feel like emergency people went to polling stations peacefully showing their id cards and cast votes
3099048 there is no reason that he should resign everything they are saying is false so why should he resign
3099049 the work of the impeachment committee is almost complete it is giving finishing touches to the charge sheet
3099050 we gave him a chance to resign we gave him a few months but we have come to the conclusion that now the people of pakistan through their elected representatives in the parliament will have to do that

3099063 the public and the current and future public servants within epa owe afge council 238 a big thank you for a job well done
3099064 this agreement means that epa will not be able to put a computer terminal and a bookshelf in a cubicle and call it a library
3099065 these libraries should never have been closed nor should it have taken months of bargaining to get epa to agree to put them back in order
3099066 the architects of these library closures cannot leave public service soon enough
3099067 our evidence suggests that the key factor is being outdoors and that it does not matter if that time is spent in having a picnic or in playing sport
3099068 both will protect a childs eyes from growing excessively which is the major cause of myopia
3099069 we have not yet established why being outside is protective
3099070 but a likely candidate is the high levels of light experienced outside compared to inside studies in animals suggest that retinal dopamine is released in response to light and dopamine is known to be able to block eye growth

3099095 because its 60ft long its very unlikely it would have found its way through the english bridge i think some kids got on it and had a free ride home
3099096 i called up the environment agency who were already aware and had some calls about it being an obstruction on the weir and a potential hazard they removed it very quickly
3099097 its really exciting to have got to this stage and after a huge amount of interest to now be able to see all the winning portraits and really envisage what the finished installation will look like
3099098 it went well theres a new pinnacle up and its a similar structure

3099128 it was poverty now mind you it was not easy there were a lot of dark days man when no food go to school hungry come back home hungry i was a high school dropout in the ninth grade because when i reached puberty you started noticing your clothes and stuff and youre noticing girls and i didnt want to go through the humiliation so i dropped out

3099167 these data add a new twist to the association and suggest that periodontal disease may be there before diabetes said ryan t

3099169 this could be suggestive that the people who lost all of their teeth had a history of infection at some point but subsequently lost their teeth and removed the source of infection

3099171 when elderly patients complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old
3099172 they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
3099173 as our population ages it has become paramount to the health of our nation to accurately describe the health problems associated with aging
3099174 a central feature of the frailty phenotype that we described years ago is self reported exhaustion the current study suggests that this concern expressed by patients or their caregivers is important and may be a very useful question in identifying older adults susceptible to functional decline and poor health outcomes
3099175 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
3099176 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as health care providers we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them
3099177 unraveling the causes of anergia will expand the scope of geriatric interventions that enable aging persons to preserve their quality of life

3099279 15 things you need to know to become a great digital scrapbooker
3099280 we the people of the united states in order to
3099281 the federal government is not the solution to our problems it is the problem
3099282 this is another example of states being two steps ahead of the federal government with the white house and gop leadership continuing to block environmental bills states are being forced to come up with their own plans
3099283 instead of wasting time debating offshore drilling plans that are opposed by the public and which will do nothing to solve our energy problems the ocean action plan wisely promotes renewable offshore energy and ecosystem based management to ensure our ocean are being administered responsibly and protected for future generations
3099284 the plan echoes calls for a commitment to our oceans through an ocean trust fund and regional ocean management federal legislation i introduced last year would create a trust fund to provide support for regional plans exactly like the one introduced on tuesday
3099285 im proud to represent the peaceful values of the central coast were lucky enough to live in communities that are aware of whats going on overseas and care about the fate of others
3099286 groups like peace action do a great job bringing a message of peace to congress and its a message many of my colleagues need to hear
3099287 five years after the beginning of the iraq war the united states desperately needs to make a fundamental change of course in foreign policy
3099288 ultimately its an active and vocal public that will determine if the country makes the profound changes in u s foreign policy we need
3099289 our military has unfortunately been forced to take on many roles it is not suited for from diplomat to nation building this civilian response corps will shift the burden of stabilization and reconstruction to civilian experts where it should have rested all along
3099290 usaid and the state department dont have the resources they need and this response corps will go a long way toward restoring their capabilities
3099291 stabilization and reconstruction is a mission that civilians must lead
3099292 but for too long our civilians have not had the capacity to lead and investments were not made to prepare them to lead
3099293 all i was saying is that from a financial point of view basically like a retirement plan or whatever that i can only do this for so many years you saw the fight today look at jon fitch look at myself as a retirement plan we can only do this for so long and all i was saying is that as a business decision and you cant argue about this its in all businesses if another company offers you something better for you and your family you would do that its the logical thing to do and thats all i was saying
3099294 people recognize that driving less is not going to add up to a solution all by itself
3099295 whats more important to them is finding other energy sources that dont just require cutbacks
3099296 i think these are understandable reactions in trying to deal with energy and environmental issues
3099297 just because americans want more drilling doesnt mean they want irresponsible drilling people often think optimistically about such things
3099298 people are saying the weather is less variable now than it was a year ago and this has led some people to become more skeptical about the existence of global warming and humans role in causing it
3099299 i wore a loose fitting t shirt yesterday august 7 i was very hot in london yesterday and its no secret i dont like wearing bras
3099300 my boob fell out twice and people on the blogs are saying it was a publicity stunt
3099301 can i just say i have been keeping myself very much to myself recently ive been gardening decorating my new flat and looking after my grieving grandfather
3099302 i saw the rescue operation i was there and an hour and half
3099303 every time i see a dead body pulled out from the wreck man i cried i just cried
3099304 very sad but thankful that we all have a strong faith
3099305 even though they can not make it to missouri we are sure they will make it in heaven
3099306 on the way home we stopped by the accident area and we prayed together
3099307 it just gives us a better appreciation for life just reminds us how short and precious life is
3099308 it began about four years ago when i was invited to be the opening speaker for the time magazine abc news and bill gates global summit on health in new york city
3099309 i turned to him and said can i help you and he said can i talk to you
3099310 so i looked at him and said david first of all id like to apologize for every single mean spirited thing that has been said to you in the name of jesus christ that jesus would disavow
3099311 miller then said nobodys ever apologized to me for anything
3099312 david then told me i believe you are ill as if he didnt believe me so that was my first little encounter with david miller
3099313 ive got an hour of time so why dont you tell me your story
3099314 david said i was a marine and i got aids in the early era of it and nobody would pay any attention to me
3099315 david then told me we formed this little group called act up to try to get attention
3099316 well over the next fifteen or twenty years david was involved in all kinds of political unrest and was arrested well over two hundred times in his life for different aids demonstrations
3099317 he told me about the problems hed had with all of his medicines and the other difficulties he had endured as a man living with aids
3099318 i told david that i wanted pastors to hear an account of his life
3099319 he added ive never felt so much love in my entire life
3099320 then i asked everybody in the conference to come by and give them a hug so for the next forty five minutes these people many of them whod never come out admitted it and wept profusely at being hugged
3099321 many of them said that they had never been hugged by so many people at one time
3099322 that was a very profound question when you think about it
3099323 and i said to him david you need to understand the difference between anger and hatred
3099324 if somebody hurt my wife id get angry if somebody hurt my children id get angry thats an evidence of love your anger is based out of hatred and my anger is based out of love and my anger out of love will outlast your anger out of hatred
3099325 i said that gandhi got angry and martin luther king got angry but they had a love underneath that so he said well we need a leader to lead the aids movement and i think its you i said david im not that guy but you could be that guy
3099326 instead of trying to lead him to christ that night i wanted him to think it through because i have found that when people seriously think through their decision then when they make that decision it is not based on emotion its based on logic and on thinking it through it makes the commitment more serious and they tend to end up being a stronger believer
3099327 we just kept showing him love well the next year i asked david to be on the program at our
3099328 lord you fill in the check in whatever you want me to do im willing to do it in advance thats called making jesus christ the lord of your life are you ready to do that and he said yes i am so we bowed our heads together and we prayed a prayer and he just began to weep
3099329 ive never heard the most sincere prayer of my life as he opened his heart to jesus christ so then i said david tomorrow morning i want to interview you in our church services i want you to just tell your story about living with aids
3099330 so we sat on stage and i interviewed him about his life and about his journey
3099331 in that first service there was a young marine who had just come back from iraq
3099332 and so the three of us went back down into the pool and david and i baptized this young marine together
3099333 i said i want you to listen to all of these this is your seminary education so for the next year he had been listening to that now were getting ready to plant a church in the bronx new york city of which david will be a member and a key lay player my goal is to buy one of these old burnt out buildings where we put a church on one floor a co op on one floor and an aids hospice on another i am pleased to report that david miller is growing by leaps and bounds
3099334 he succumbed several days after being hospitalized for pneumonia which arose from a longstanding lung ailment sarcoidosis at northwestern memorial hospital chicago danica smith told people magazine

3099368 i have shared some good moments with abhinav during the 2006 world championships at zagreb and can tell you that he was the most devoted and focused guy he was pretty calm composed and didn t talk much but always kept track of his scores his win is the result of a heavy training regime that he underwent since the last few years
3099369 hats off to abhinav for the way he shot today it was a masterstroke the way he claimed a perfect ten in the last shot to outclass defending champion zhu qinan it was a close game and he won by a margin of just 0 8 points

3099402 and the russians are doing what comes naturally to them in their new mood they know the europeans dont want a face off with russia gazprom they know the u s is so preoccupied with its own self inflicted disasters that it can do nothing but wring it hands so why not now it also would seem to stop nato enlargement in its tracks just imagine georgia inside nato and protected under article 5
3099403 russia is feeling its oats and yes georgia is george bushs beacon for liberty in the caucasus whats he going to do the russians know one thing how to count the cards they know that not one of these chickens
3099404 almost every conflict in the region begins with a huge miscalculation by one or more parties the georgians are fully capable of this miscalculation they believed they were going to hear the bugles coming over the hill they are not going to hear anything
3099405 churkin accused the united states of aiding and abetting saakashvili saying more than 100 u s advisers were providing training to georgian forces on the eve of their military offensive against south ossetia and suggested that u s officials may have given georgia the green light to strike

3099414 contact centres are under pressure to deal with far higher volumes of calls and to execute queries faster and more effectively whats more increasing numbers of customers are demanding information immediately and it must be correct gone are the days when customers accepted slow responses from the contact centre instead theyre opting to use self service
3099415 its estimated that a successful self service transaction amounts to only 15 of the cost of a human agent call the average cost of a self service transaction is usd4 compared to usd34 per human agent transaction employing self service applications provides a staggering cost benefit to organisations simultaneously freeing up agents to deal with more complex and emotive inquiries
3099416 the cost of getting it wrong is significantly higher than the cost of getting it right
3099417 a customer centric approach should dictate an organisations non voice channel development and the impact on the end user should not be underestimated
3099418 the contact centre industry is fast approaching the threshold when it will no longer be able to manage the volumes of demand from customers to retain these customers and save costs its vital that contact centres move the simpler routine transactions to well designed self service channels
3099419 the use of the me domain extension has seen individuals embrace its verb oriented potential by registering catchy domain names like fly me and insure me personalised domains such as joebloggs me and unconventional domain names that combine domain extensions to make a full word or a kind of pun such as aweso me

3099530 ie8 has been significantly enhanced and was designed with great support for current internet standards this is evidenced by the fact that even in its first beta ie8 correctly renders the popular test known as acid2 which was created by the web community to promote real world interoperability
3099531 our initial plan had been to use ie7 compatible behavior as the default setting for ie8 to minimize potential impact on the worlds existing web sites we have now decided to make our most current standards based mode the default in ie8

3099533 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform intel provides the vast majority of chipsets for its processors and following its purchase of ati amd is also moving very quickly in the same direction
3099534 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now

3099550 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3099551 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3099552 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3099553 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3099554 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3099555 it has severely damaged our moral authority in the world i mean after the u s invasion of iraq after abu ghraib after our blithe rubbishing of the geneva accords why should anyone listen to us when we criticize the russians for their aggression in the caucasus
3099556 we should use all the diplomatic leverage we have to end this invasion
3099557 it will send a message to everyone that this path doesnt work
3099558 there are reports that we green lighted georgias attacks on south ossetia
3099559 but it is important yet again to call out the endless neoconservative search for new enemies mini hitlers

3099562 kagan is smart and modulated in this case he carefully lays out the u s and european union initiatives in eastern europe that have led to the russian pushback most of the western actions have been morally justified support for the new democracies and georgia may be the most heart warming example in the region others including the costly and technologically untenable missile defense system fantasized by bush have been unnecessarily provocative and kagans right wingman bill kristol is similarly modulated in the ny times
3099563 but it is important yet again to call out the endless neoconservative search for new enemies mini hitlers
3099564 m4a though doesnt even try to discuss he just states that his ideas should not be questioned and then runs and hides behind his brothers

3099571 our evidence suggests that the key factor is being outdoors and that it does not matter if that time is spent in having a picnic or in playing sport
3099572 both will protect a childs eyes from growing excessively which is the major cause of myopia
3099573 we have not yet established why being outside is protective
3099574 but a likely candidate is the high levels of light experienced outside compared to inside studies in animals suggest that retinal dopamine is released in response to light and dopamine is known to be able to block eye growth
3099575 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3099576 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3099577 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3099585 its a silent but deadly source of greenhouse gases that contributes more to global warming than the entire world transportation sector yet politicians almost never discuss it and environmental lobbyists and other green activist groups seem unaware of its existence

3099587 the rumen is a sort of continuous culture of anaerobic microbes including protozoa and bacteria which collectively ferment the starch and cellulose of grass to yield fatty acids methane and carbon dioxide

3099607 theres no way and then it changed to this is ridiculous its the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im just going to out there and give it

3099623 if there is a great deal of uncertainty in the market and in policies in the market that investment capacity will be deployed elsewhere
3099624 its just ludicrous that the congress is letting this opportunity slip away
3099625 this was a case was difficult because of the uncertainty surrounding the future losses this man faced a possbile future amputation and diminished earning capacity related thereto
3099626 our client a diabetic faced a possible amputation below the knee as a result of the wound and resulting infection as such he was under incredible emotional distress about an event that was not certain to occur this made valuing the case at the settlement phase facing extremely challenging
3099627 there really were a lot of factors working against us in the case including the clients failure to wear safety boots in an area where submerged objects posed a threat of danger
3099628 a recent report by the center for global development found that even by the most conservative estimates a 35 year old mexican male with nine years of education would make 132 percent more working in the united states than in his home country for a bolivian the increase would be closer to 270 percent and for a haitian more than 740 percent
3099629 the united states has long expressed concerns about government financial support for the launch of commercial aircraft and has pursued this issue with the europeans in the wto world trade organization
3099630 washington will take a very careful look at the support announced by canada quebec and the u k to ensure they do not distort the market for commercial airliners or contravene wto rules
3099631 the governments we are working with are totally aware of the wto rules and we are confident the repayable government investment we have arranged is compliant with these international obligations

3099638 what im hearing which is sort of scary is they all want to stay in texas everyone is so overwhelmed by the hospitality and so many of the people in the arena here you know were underprivileged anyway so this is working very well for them
3099639 first of all i dont see americas problems because didnt i just sign something that is going to cure the housing and lending mess thats what they told me its the other countries that have problems not america under our loving god who talks to me

3099642 did you even read the summary after the quote its not often people provide a link that disputes their own assertions
3099643 her characterizations would be quite accurate if the same malady afflicted detroit as callous as that sounds it is reality ive seen it firsthand
3099644 you are erecting such strawmen borne out of prejudice and ignorance
3099645 anyway in regards to your 1038am the snopes link provided you with the context of the quote she was discussing how the media in the run up to the war was doing nothing but guess work and throwing out numbers that they had no way of knowing and which turned out to be completely off of the mark
3099646 you seem to have no clue as to what you are talking about a bunch of politically correct bullshit
3099647 seriously i would very possibly get my ass kicked but if you actually had the temerity to say those exact words to me in person i would come out swinging
3099648 well if you knew the numbers being bandied about were completely irrelevent or inaccurate why would you worry about them
3099649 now how about those crime stats for the refugee towns and cities in texas would those be something youd concern yourself about if they were moving to your neck of the woods
3099650 for fucks sake if one describes a shit hole like the hoods of detroit for what they are one must be a reich wing asshole
3099651 regardless fuck you for trying to diminish my point by attacking me personally
3099652 im sure after jan you wont hear things like recession or quagmire anymore
3099653 this is a losing argument for you because history has proven those initial numbers to be irrellevent
3099654 they werent even in the ballpark with their pr war predictions
3099655 fair enough my question then becomes where do they come from in the first place
3099656 do you think that a former first lady and the present day mother of a sitting president needs to hear keith olbermann tell her about national security matters
3099657 as to iraq before obama or mccain is even elected were probably going to have a timeline to get out of iraq mostly so why would we be hearing about that in january when its already been decided
3099658 not to bring this back to reality but it says he listens it doesnt say he worried about anything
3099659 id be willing to bet youve never set foot into detroit

3099888 gt 2008 beijing olympics over the weekend i spent a fair amount of time watching the xxix olympic games from beijing taking in all that comes along with the quadrennial celebration that is the olympics it was an excellent weekend of competition celebration and pageantry
3099889 sports that is the essence of amateur competition not completely divorced from many of the reasons i so identify with college athletics as opposed to professional sports
3099890 amateurism from the olympics as an ideal governing the competition between nations
3099891 still has a lot of stones in his sling when it comes to the
3099892 now there is an increasingly powerful and vocal national movement to stop mountaintop removal
3099893 im saying were going to have it stopped by the end of next year the end of 2009
3099894 if the american people knew what was happening in appalachia i feel certain that they would demand an end to this practice
3099895 i think if we get a new president itll be stopped and i guess were going to get a new president by next year
3099896 i can tell you we havent had any significant permits issued since march 2007 because the court found that the federal government was illegally issuing permits at that time
3099897 how can they approve the filling of hundreds and a couple thousand miles of mountain streams in this region and say thats not significantly degrading the water
3099898 all i can say is the corps hasnt been doing its job up until now
3099899 i wouldnt be able to comment on what we think the 4th circuits going to rule but that appeal and those four individual permits do not affect the army corps ability to issue further individual permits and they have been doing that
3099900 the plaintiffs again have filed suit over those and that is still in litigation
3099901 have we issued any coal mining permits since the ruling yes we have do we feel it complies with the judges ruling yes we do
3099902 in the regulatory department we follow the rules and regulations as passed on to us by congress and the judges whatever they decide is what we will do we are neither for projects nor against projects
3099903 they would still be able to do traditional surface mining which is what we call contour surface mining where they mine around the mountains and reclaim the land when theyre done
3099904 they put the material back up into the mined area
3099905 it would be devastating and not just to southwest virginia counties it would impact washington county it would impact the tri cities area the coal dollar flows in lots of directions
3099906 when you live in a mountainous region sometimes you appreciate the flat land
3099907 weve got airports weve got housing developments weve got shopping centers because of land flattened by mining
3099908 one of the reasons we pushed so hard for circulating fluidized bed clean coal technology for this power station is its ability to burn a wide variety of fuels
3099909 we will be able to design our fuel plan around a wide range of coal waste coal and biomass and can make adjustments as the market for those fuels changes
3099910 the next administration could clarify the federal regulations and make it clear that mountaintop removal mining was never foreseen when the surface mining laws were passed and is not permitted under those laws
3099911 we can fight with agencies all we want but its going to take some will in washington to get things done
