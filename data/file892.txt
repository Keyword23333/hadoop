8920012 recreational activities play a massive part in the life of the national park they make a huge contribution to the local economy and provide opportunities for people to enjoy a healthier lifestyle and visit the national park
8920013 but at the same time some activities can be noisy or cause damage to the landscape large numbers of visitors can also create congestion pollution and problems with parking
8920014 this will be one of the biggest surveys carried out in the peak district to find out what people are doing with their time when they come here to help us plan how to improve opportunities for all
8920015 it only takes a few minutes to fill in the questionnaire so we hope as many people as possible will take the opportunity to give us the information we need to plan services better with our partners
8920016 we are also really keen to hear from people who dont use the national park to find out what is putting them off and what services they would want to see before they would feel comfortable coming
8920017 although their objectives are similar the candidates take very different routes to reach them

8920021 we want people to identify their top priorities and the values that are most important to their lives

8920124 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and our respect and next week well also hear about those occasions when hes broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but i am not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8920125 ill eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8920126 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8920127 ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support and in exchange ill ask for higher standards and more accountability
8920128 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8920129 but we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children
8920130 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8920131 you dont defeat you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq you dont protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8920132 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and each others patriotism the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8920133 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you

8920147 i am torn between grief of losing a child and the thought of explaining to the other woman how her child died if its hers
8920148 i cannot even mourn the babys death because i am not sure if she was mine
8920149 i feel it is almost comical the hysteria that surrounds two games the fact that we have got no points after two games
8920150 i think manchester united took four games last season to get their first victory and they went on to win the league title pretty comfortably
8920151 im not suggesting that we are going to win the title but if you go by that remit weve still got a chance it is hysteria it is the industry that we are in
8920152 my point is it is a long long season and in the two games with sides who came third arsenal and fifth everton last season we have done okay
8920153 to go to the emirates stadium is a tough ask for anyone for even manchester united chelsea and liverpool and we did okay
8920154 as for the everton game from my point of view i am about performance levels and our performance levels were very high for vast spells of that game
8920155 if i break down the stats of that game 15 shots to their five 27 crosses to their six the stats suggest the team that won wasnt the dominant one
8920156 the only stat that matters is 2 1 to everton but the point is the performance was good enough for us to win football matches
8920157 if all the stats had been against us and we had lost 2 1 then it would have been a concern but that was not the case
8920158 i cant see how it is going to impact on the football match which is my only interest really the 11 versus 11 out on the football pitch
8920159 i dont know the history but from my perspective gary is a highly respected football manager who has had a long career and his team will be well prepared to try to beat us at the weekend
8920160 bolton have had a lot of success over the years playing a certain brand of football we play a different way but both sides will be trying to impose their styles on each other
8920161 as for myself i have a very good relationship with the chairman he is a very hard working and conscientious guy who wants the club to progress as do i
8920162 thats why we were both in before eight oclock yesterday morning trying to progress our club we work hand in hand
8920163 hes a very good player and as juande ramos has said many times were delighted hes with us
8920164 i dont really want to comment about speculation but we just hope hes going to stay
8920165 we will comment and will let you know when weve got news
8920166 its difficult for me to comment on different rumours and speculation
8920167 he plays for another club we respect and they have got a game tonight
8920168 at the moment weve got some targets but its news to me about henrik larsson
8920169 c una cartella con gli spazi ed anche il file ne ha txt
8920170 were seeing a fundamental shift from fixed telephone access lines to bundled voice video and internet services over dsl and other broadband access networks
8920171 as a result the dsl iad market more than doubled from below five million units shipped in 2005 to almost 12 million in 2007 with the emea market approaching 80 percent of these shipments all the major incumbent operators in emea including bt france telecom and deutsche telecom are deploying dsl
8920172 incumbent dsl operators often offer voip as a second line to augment the customers traditional phone service
8920173 the ve890 enables seamless integration of the dsl gateway with the public switched telephone network and voip services with the new zarlink dsl optimized chipsets we can offer customers a single source for a complete portfolio of voice interface solutions for all voip applications
8920174 we have been successfully using zarlinks legerity voice product line in our dsl iads for several years
8920175 the introduction of the new ve890 product family with its fxo capability allows us to immediately support new requirements coming from some of our european customers
8920176 the versatile back thinned ccd spectrometer is a cost effective solution for wide spectral measurements that are typically covered by multiple front illuminated ccds
8920177 the back thinned structure improves illumination level thus increasing the ccd dynamic range and scan speed
8920178 it is with deep regret that we have accepted dennis mumbles resignation dennis is a bright intelligent football administrator with whom i have personally worked since 1990 he submitted his letter of resignation citing personal reasons and we will respect his wishes
8920179 he has made a tremendous contribution to the organising committee and we continue to have the highest regard for his ability we wish him well in his future endeavors and hope that he may still be an asset to the 2010 fifa world cup organising committee in future
8920180 the only thing they could still do is to try to be more direct they tried to control the contact situations last week and to be more physical and they will try that again but we are also a physical team they might also try to move across the field a little more
8920181 we could pick up a problem with the back three
8920182 but they are only inexperienced as a combination as individuals they are experienced enough to cover each other
8920183 that said a weakness could become a strength and a strength could become a weakness if australia dont kick well it could count in our favour
8920184 they have one more shot at it in this years tri nations
8920185 if they can take it they can park the rest of the tournament and move forward a lot more positively towards their end of season tour preparations
8920186 ask yourself how youd feel in their position theres no doubt theyll be up for it
8920187 by winning in durban last weekend we have presented ourselves with an opportunity to win back to back tests in sa which is not only rare in an australian context it is also historically significant across the game in general
8920188 we owe it to ourselves and to everyone associated with australian rugby to make the most of the chance
8920189 not true they arent appearing and were never going to i dont know where this story came from
8920190 this attack feels a bit different to the 2005 one but i think it has a bit more pace to it ninety miles an hour is difficult to face i have been asked whether i was surprised at the way south africa capitulated but i wasnt really not when broady got the first four or five out with the firepower we had after that i would have backed us to bowl anybody out for 80
8920191 the core of fast bowlers available now is exciting if we can keep the four that bowled this week fit and add ryan sidebottom to that he has been englands best bowler in the past 14 months and he has got to come back somewhere hopefully we can get a group of batters too a steady couple of wicket keepers and then we will have a strong squad going to india and the west indies this winter and we can come back with some confidence for next summers ashes
8920192 we are the first ones to build a display that changes with lighting weve finally found a way to build the most realistic display

8920304 micky sulejmani zei dat het een aardige ploeg is ze spelen op karakter en kunnen best voetballen we zullen goed geprepareerd moeten zijn

8920317 the cylinders been propelled up with significant force to do the damage that it has and its happened very quickly so it probably would have been a matter of seconds
8920318 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8920319 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8920320 i think we can look to some additional expansion some time down the line
8920321 but i cannot support this proposal unless some things are looked at
8920322 if we allow more groups to join where does it end
8920323 what i want to make sure is if the senior clubs are within our definition and it sounds like theyre not
8920324 these clubs operate under their own budget and their own board
8920325 each and every club would have to be approved by the board because it could increase the rec fee
8920326 our program really has become a model for reno sparks and washoe county
8920327 its really a volunteer senior organization that washoe county would love to emulate down there they do all the work and have few volunteers
8920328 there are extra wires inside of it being used at this time it would work forever this way but the company that makes the controller will have to go in and find where the short is and repair it
8920329 the applicants would go to our rotary partnership district in italy to study and work in their field of expertise
8920330 it would be a great experience and they would be expected to serve as ambassadors for rotary and more importantly the united states
8920331 how i lived my life under water and why i prefer the scent of chlorine to chanel
8920332 you are different odious in fact and besides that you worship a false god
8920333 over 1 3 million acres have already burned this year in california
8920334 vegetation is extremely dry across the state and when you add these dry north winds to the mix the chance of a major fire igniting increases
8920335 you can never be 100 percent sure my gut feeling is that they were dead
8920336 we were relieved that the system is working i dont think we were overly surprised with the infestation level at lake mead we werent shocked
8920337 the issue of the introduction of destructive invasive species to lake tahoe is a real and immediate threat and requires the combined efforts of all who recreate manage and owe their livelihood to lake tahoe
8920338 i dont think thats going to fuel anything because were already in a state of emergency
8920339 everybodys willing to do it how are we going to accomplish it
8920340 i think this is a great opportunity for our students
8920341 i appreciate the chance to work with sierra nevada college and look forward to a successful partnership
8920342 incline village is fortunate to have such an outstanding high school in its community and we feel honored to have the opportunity to collaborate with them
8920343 i think this is truly one of those win win situations the opportunity for students to enroll in dual enrollment courses will make this fine high school even more attractive to parents and the association with this respected school will certainly benefit our college
8920344 we offer a large array of available courses to make sure students have a variety of choices
8920345 there are a whole lot of students applying to college with college classes already under their belt
8920346 another attractive aspect of dual enrollment is that it decreases the cost of college because paying for the courses in high school is cheaper than paying for college courses
8920347 were within 3 million of what the economic forum projected and i think thats good news at this point
8920348 i would have thought the list would have been addressed during the hours staff spent working with independent incline
8920349 i say we start preparing on july 2 2009 and not before
8920350 theres a significant amount of work that needs to be done with the legislature that has been contemplated as a prerequisite to make this work
8920351 from a legal aspect it would require a lot of my time and a lot of staffs time to finish up the negotiations that have been started
8920352 whats happening is independent incline is telling everyone that this isnt going to impact ivgid employees that this is revenue neutral
8920353 but we have some employees really worried about their jobs concerned with their livelihood
8920354 im troubled because some of these items on the list are very critical and we really need to have guidelines on how to look at them
8920355 were going to be looking at budget and approving one that will be approved by a board that doesnt exist yet
8920356 you have to remember that when you approve the budget in may 2009 youll be approving the budget for the town not an ivgid budget
8920357 the concept of revenue neutrality is the budgets would be the same
8920358 i think the list needs to be massaged by a number of people including independent incline ivgid and an attorney
8920359 we gave him every kind of opportunity and he continued to hang around in downtown carson thats just no good for a bear its a public safety issue
8920360 we release dozens of bears every year we release far more bears than we euthanize
8920361 a 400 pound bear being able to disappear in a small neighborhood like that was incredible
8920362 i came into this week 75 percent sure im voting for obama and now im 100 percent sure im voting for obama

8920364 they are seeds in which the whole generation sleeps confident of the future and for a moment it is easy to believe each one has one will become all of what is contained in the spore will live out its days as planned
8920365 we are extremely excited to bring this unique show to the cotai strip as our first permanent step in china
8920366 the creative challenge is very interesting for us as this area has yet to be developed for its entertainment offers
8920367 we are both proud and delighted to be partnering with cirque du soleil and bringing this internationally acclaimed production to macau and to its first ever permanent base in asia
8920368 cirque du soleil will surely give the people of this region a chance to experience wholly unique and world class entertainment an aim to which we are also committed
8920369 we have a program chocked full of fun food facts and quick to fix recipe ideas for you to try at home
8920370 its a culinary extravaganza ok maybe not an extravaganza but definitely a lively demonstration of impressive dishes that are easy to prepare imagine lava chocolate cakes warm and gooey from the oven baked as individual little cakes served with whipped cream listen for the wows as your guests cut into the cakes and watch the chocolate lava ooze onto their forks warm rich and chocolately what says comfort more on a cold autumn day
8920371 jim was one of those extraordinary people who had built up a very strategic rolodex in terms of networking for the bid and when he died yeah we missed a step or two
8920372 it was our goal to keep this effort alive though and we kicked into another gear going over jims notes and records to re establish these contacts and his friends and colleagues are continuing to work smartly to make up for his absence
8920373 a large amount of networking went on while i was in beijing
8920374 there is no way weve been able to salvage everything jim was able to collect over the years but the trip to beijing helped to rekindle it a bit and went a long way toward making those connections again
8920375 until you really look behind the scenes you dont get a sense of what it takes to put on an olympics the procedures and details required
8920376 you see everything from the events to the way olympics transform a city and leave a sustainable green legacy
8920377 from everything ive learned reno tahoe has more than sufficient potential for rail service to and from the bay area
8920378 we hope chicago does well we hope the u s gets the bid
8920379 we do live in an area with one of the highest concentration of resorts in the world
8920380 but for events like snowboarding and cross country skiing we want to really spread them around not only to spread the wealth around but also the congestion
8920381 we are a destination resort area and im confident hotels will come to the area both reno tahoe and sacramento if the games came here
8920382 we have times of the year that get pretty crowded and were talking about sustaining that for a two to three week time span
8920383 but the legacy the games would leave behind in terms of positive environmental impacts infrastructure and investments would be something area residents could enjoy for a long time to come

8920391 you guys stuck with me and now were bringing home championship number 17
8920392 ive seen some pretty stiff defences and this was right up there with them
8920393 they definitely were the best defence ive seen in the entire play offs
8920394 kobe started off that game with a hot hand and then his legs you could see his shot was flat
8920395 he didnt get his shot going and it really changed the course of the game he started out so strong and then he only made three field goals the rest of the game so that really was a change
8920396 one of the things they did is they really focused on him and made sure that he wasnt going to be the guy that hurt them and we didnt have guys step up in this instance tonight
8920397 that was the first thing i thought of what he would say
8920398 i laughed because i thought he would say its about time
8920399 in many network environments securing standard ftp traffic is a policy requirement and its also a best practice
8920400 weve supported the secure shell sftp protocol since the first release of vshell in 2000 but many of our customers still need to provide ftp ftps support in vshell 3 5 gives organizations an additional option for providing file transfer without putting critical data or systems at risk
8920401 our customers connect to a range of remote servers and have asked for protocol flexibility
8920402 now they can select either the standard vshell with secure shell sftp support or the vshell server that includes support for both sftp and ftps

8920497 we now have two federal courts that have rejected wyomings position
8920498 the faxed offer from marseille yesterday was for a two day trial with the possibility of a free loan
8920499 that is completely and utterly unacceptable in fact its laughable both the chairman adam pearson and the manager paul jewell communicated this to the player directly and to marseille and made it clear that as the offer stood there would be no deal
8920500 theres a great camaraderie between the fans and the players a real buzz
8920501 i certainly think it was a real threat before tony stewart the clubs new owner came on the scene and put forward a proposal that the administrator could accept
8920502 before he came along we were very close to not having any funds in may there wasnt the money to keep the club running at its full operational level we were on the brink
8920503 no one knew where to park its a huge athletic stadium it seats 25 000 people and the facilities are top class its a strange experience they just open the huge main stand so its in effect a one sided ground

8920510 young households are being forced out of the property market across the country it is particularly bad in areas where wages and salaries are low yet demand for homes is high
8920511 the index reveals that for savvy house hunters the most crucial aspects determining future return on investment are the low house price to high income ratio and the recent house price growth rate of the area alongside any regeneration prospects
8920512 buying in an up and coming property hotspot can help first time buyers climb the ladder faster to their ideal property or location in the future
8920513 there is too much unsold property still available to expect anything other than a continuation of static asking prices this year
8920514 interest rates fell recently but mortgage lenders have been slow to pass the reduction on to consumers borrowers who are holding out for an even lower fixed rate are playing an anxious waiting game
8920515 really is first time buyers and there is a lot of demand for flats two thirds of tenants are actually under 35 so they are the people that are being hurt by rising house prices and rising mortgage rates
8920516 man wird sich aber wahrscheinlich darauf einigen das nicht zu tun sondern sie nur auf der hohen politischen ebene zu stornieren

8920521 we want people to identify their top priorities and the values that are most important to their lives
8920522 then we encourage them to be a little imaginative about what comes next and become less anxious about their new freedom
8920523 forced me to home in on the hard questions what do i really value what do i need as a person
8920524 as i listened to other people discuss their fears and dreams i found myself saying i would like to spend a month in tuscany
8920525 i fear the loss of stimulation that comes with work it gives me meaning and structure
8920526 there would be a loss of friends and even my plumber
8920527 if you want to know what somebody values ask them how they spend their time
8920528 although their objectives are similar the candidates take very different routes to reach them
8920529 the obama platform leans more heavily on public sector institutions and regulatory requirements whereas the mccain platform prefers tax incentives and other strategies to promote free market activity and encourage individual responsibility
8920530 if employers are not the primary source for medical coverage will they still be inclined to promote health and wellness in the workplace if not would the government fill the void
8920531 does an employer pay or play mandate as advocated by obama make it more difficult for u s companies to compete globally is coverage expansion through mandates worth the potential cost to the u s economy

8920557 more and more of our customers in the industry are seeking to leverage the synergies that arise from one stop shopping in addition because schott already has considerable expertise in areas like hermetic sealing and optical glass the decision to also offer high quality molded aspheres that are sealed with low temperature solder glass is really quite natural

8920563 i havent felt this good in the event ever i enjoyed 80 percent of the walk and only suffered 20 per cent and in the past it has been almost the opposite
8920564 i love the event the charity the teamwork and the fundraising thats why i keep coming back
8920565 weve seen an incredible result today by adam ian paul and toby and an even more incredible result by the 2000 sydneysiders involved in the event who have raised 2 million even before it even started
8920566 we are well on track to our target of 3 2 million dollars and can celebrate the 10th anniversary of trailwalker in australia with a bang

8920573 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
8920574 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
8920575 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
8920576 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
8920577 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing
8920578 sometimes i get angry at the dictionary and let loose with a muffled yell
8920579 the point at which i became bored has long since passed
8920580 human smoke the beginnings of world war ii the end of civilization
8920581 over the years we have invested heavily in protecting our network perimeter and locking down our website however the threat landscape is continually evolving and hacker attacks are becoming highly targeted cleverly written to circumvent network defences
8920582 we hold highly confidential information on our members a data security breach would have disastrous ramifications for us damaging not only our reputation but also the security of our members to whom we have a duty of care
8920583 in view of the ever increasing complexity of security threats organisations can no longer make do with disjointed security measures especially in todays web centric and geographically dispersed business environments security and data protection compliance can only be successful if measures are in place to actively pre empt security breaches reactive security measures are futile the damage in those situations has already been done
8920584 despite being a relatively new implementation the results are clearly visible we have a better understanding of how why and by whom our databases are being used and more importantly we are in a position to continually make security improvements it has been a very sound investment
8920585 making the final of these prestigious awards for the second year running demonstrates that end users continue to recognise the high quality and usability of our document management solutions achieving the shortlist at a time when there is such stiff competition within the document management marketplace makes becoming a finalist especially rewarding and we hope that once again we come away from the software satisfaction awards ceremony as the paperless office champion
8920586 we have an excellent team at version one who strives to exceed customer expectations making the shortlist is as a direct result of all their hard work and dedication
8920587 having the 30 day installation was important for us as we needed to change our connection as soon as possible like many small businesses we knew there were advantages to getting a new connection and wed had service issues with our old provider but had put off finding a new supplier because of the perceived hassle of switching
8920588 too many businesses receive poor service from their internet provider and our 30 day installation pledge and free sms updates will help put an end to this we are looking to reduce the installation times for all of our services and relying on our own un bundled connections gives us greater control over our connections our llu network not only provides faster leased line equivalent services but allows faster install times as well our sms service not only helps us get to the bottom of any outages quicker but also helps users minimise the impact of a loss of service
8920589 under the ia contract we will be able to supply the mod with everything they need from desktops and laptops to software and all associated licences this means we can bring the same savings through leveraging our long established hardware relationships as we have done historically for their software purchases using our twenty years of experience establishing ourselves in this market the mod has always valued the relationship it has with trustmarque and in the past has expressed a wish to do more work through us as we are a reliable and trusted partner that always delivers an industry leading service it was therefore a natural choice for us to take on the hardware contract in enterprises such as the mod it is mission critical and mistakes can result in life and death situations if it falls down at the same time it has a duty to spend money wisely on behalf of the public and value is essential which means tenders are always competitive so we are particularly pleased that we have come out on top once again and are able to extend our offering
8920590 xjtag is an absolute necessity for any company that is designing complex circuits that feature high pin count bga or chip scale devices xjtag is easy to use and incredibly fast which has enabled us to shave weeks off the development schedule for our rfeye module thereby leaving our development team free to develop rather than sitting around painstakingly debugging boards
8920591 xjtags appeal is also its versatility it is designed to be used right throughout the product lifecycle from design and development through to the factory floor and beyond
8920592 xjtag can also test both jtag and non jtag devices which means that test coverage is very high we can get to over 80 of devices on the rfeye boards via the jtag chain whats more xjtag provides the ability to re use and port test scripts between circuit boards which saves us loads of time
8920593 the current uk regulatory framework governing the delivery of mobile services was established to promote competition in infrastructure based services that were delivered solely through mobile communications networks
8920594 with users increasingly focussed on consumption of content across multiple networks adjustments to the uk regulatory framework are likely to be required if the benefits of the emerging trends are to be fully realised
8920595 moving from our prior homegrown paper based succession process to successfactors has given us a better method to identify and assess our talent
8920596 using successfactors we are now able to look at talent management through an entirely new lens that gives us the insight to create new ways to retain our top talent and incorporate this into our larger business strategy
8920597 caribou coffee is a great example of a company driving the strategy of its business by aligning employee development with business goals

8920599 by further building low cost online services that enticed shippers with its ease of use and reporting amtrak had the potential to secure their position as a real player in this space
8920600 i left because sadly technology was not seen as a key investment at the time an investment for the future of the company and a revenue earner but instead it was seen as a cost whilst it is a sad day and a lesson learnt too late for amtrak it sends a warning out to others than they must embrace the changing nature of the marketplace if they are to survive
8920601 sms is a good way to get the message out to a small group whether it is a notification reminder for a prayer meeting a change in time for a religious service an announcement for a forthcoming youth event or a call to action to support those in need
8920602 we have stated the real and factual truth reflecting the daylight robbery by mtc in operating on profit margins to the tune of 432 percent on off net calls during peak times and 273 percent during off peak times this truth would stand when all explanations from mtc fail
8920603 mtc pays a large percentage to telecom because tele com enjoys unhindered statutory monopoly of this service
8920604 since they are benchmarked along the models prevailing in the southern africa development community region and to a large extent to the european market as well
8920605 thereafter both parties made their proposals to mtc which proposal was accordingly accep ted mtc never imposed the regime but accepted what was proposed by both cell one and telecom we have on several occasions pointed out to both the minister of information and communication technology and to the namibian communications commission that we prefer and support a serious dialogue between operators on the model to be agreed on under the auspices of the ncc
8920606 contrary to public belief that such charges emanate from the fact that such calls terminate or transit through the telecoms network telecom deemed it proper to inform the public to the real and actual situation on the ground
8920607 desperate attempt to abuse the vacuum left by the current legislation on the telecommunications industry

8920613 hmm this is a guy who is attempting to inflame racial tensions and using racism as a crutch he is part of a party that puts people of all races creeds and nationalities in a box judging them by the color of their skin not the content of their character

8920657 were dancing on akkis hit numbers i think he deserves the success coming his way
8920658 he just went on and on and on either tom tomming about shilpa or giving scandalous quotes
8920659 he was on an untiring trip to prove to the world that he could play with the media in real life this guy is a split personality and thinks he can do anything such people can be dangerous to society as they can end up shaping thoughts of millions their way just because of their reach in media
8920660 like in hindi films the hero with all his goodness comes out victorious in the end i have a very strong feeling shilpa shetty too will meet the same fate in big brother by the time it ends
8920661 he was too busy giving telephonic interviews to news agencies and sent an assistant to offer me tea and biscuits in a garden below his building i waited under the sun till he finished his other interviews only after that was i able to enter his house for my news bytes
8920662 but when he spoke he spoke like a man possessed my editor just loved his quotes though i felt he said a lot of things just for effect
8920663 its almost been five years we have been working together i know her well by now if she was in my place here she would have said more or less the same words
8920664 if i know shilpa well she is not the kind to give up this would be a temporary low trust me she has it in her to fight back and i believe she will
8920665 i get into the psyche of every client to understand how their minds function its very important for any publicist to do this as every client is a different individual and needs to be understood as a separate entity once this is accomplished its cakewalk to vibe
8920666 i thoroughly believe in the work i do if i can publicize my clients well why shouldnt i do a little for myself too
8920667 is it a crime for a publicist to think he too can be written about if yes lets please bend the rule a bit lets please change the trend a bit
8920668 a few days ago shilpa and i have parted ways she is a wonderful person and i thoroughly enjoyed doing her pr we have been a great team and i wish her loads of success in future too
8920669 life can be summed up in three words it moves on rather than think of the parting i smile as i look back on the great times we shared and the great work we did while the good times lasted i am looking forward to more good times with newer clients now
8920670 ich rette zwischen fr hst ck und mittagessen mal eben die ganze spielwelt

8920673 it is a win win opportunity for both fujitsu india and tata elxsi i am sure both the companies will complement each other through this great association as the strength of tata elxsi is its capability to integrate business critical solutions and the fujitsu india is a great innovator of technology while tata elxsi would leverage on fujitsus brand equity technology leadership we would gain from their presence and experience in the automotive aerospace defence education amp research media amp entertainment and manufacturing verticals i am confident that this collaboration will create a high and positive business growth and customer satisfaction
8920674 we are delighted to enter into this highly complimentary relationship with techm that will deliver the huge benefits of indian offshoring to the european market place there is substantial potential for growth which is reflected in current demand as european companies are at relatively early stages in their use of it offshoring for competitive advantage compared to their american counterparts
8920675 tech mahindras strategy of pursuing long term customer relationships has always yielded definitive results
8920676 sse imov sse may have rebound in making china stocks will be back in my radar for next few days yeas some stocks have shown the signs of trend reversal ill monitor amp act accordingly i dont mind to buy at slightly higher price the vital stuff better reward risk ratio

8920678 vom wirklichen genuss des lebens kenne ich gar nichts f r mich ist der genuss des lebens und der liebe nur ein gegenstand der einbildungskraft nicht der erfahrung so musste mir das herz in das hirn treten und mein leben nur noch ein k nstliches werden nur noch als k nstler kann ich leben in ihm ist mein ganzer mensch aufgegangen

8920684 conform ment ce que jai dit auparavant je refuse de me prononcer

8920686 je nai pas encore compos mon quipe dassoci s et daides
8920687 yo en repetidas oportunidades he dicho que estoy en contra del proyecto pascua lama no por revolver el gallinero sino simplemente por motivos de humanidad y tambi n por el lado del evangelio de jes s
8920688 afecta la seguridad del ecosistema del valle del huasco por el riesgo de la contaminaci n a pesar de los largos estudios que dicen seg n las autoridades regionales que est n cubiertos todos los posibles flancos de riesgo
8920689 siempre caben preocupaciones a futuro por lo que puede significar un error como ha pasado en otros proyectos como celco en chile y tambi n en otros pa ses de am rica latina
8920690 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
8920691 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
8920692 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
8920693 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8920694 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n
8920695 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8920696 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap siguen las protestas contra la transnacional canadiense barrick gold y el estado chileno por el conflicto pascua lama leer mas aqu
8920697 la escuela en un alto grado es una fuente de cultivo para el racismo la discriminaci n la negaci n de todo lo mapuche
8920698 los derechos educativos y ling sticos son parte importante de los derechos colectivos de nuestro pueblo naci n mapuche reconocidos por la legislaci n internacional en varios instrumentos convenio 169 oit convenci n de los derechos del ni o declaraci n de diversidad cultural unesco declaraci n de la onu derechos pueblos ind genas y que en el proyecto lge del gobierno no son expresados reflejando una vez mas la sistem tica pol tica de violaci n a nuestros derechos pol ticos como pueblo naci n mapuche por parte de la institucionalidad racista del estado chileno
8920699 disminuye la cantidad de hablantes y se interrumpe el aprendizaje por las nuevas ge ne ra ciones
8920700 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
8920701 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8920702 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8920703 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8920704 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8920705 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8920706 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8920707 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8920708 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8920709 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8920710 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8920711 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8920712 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8920713 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
8920714 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
8920715 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8920716 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8920717 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8920718 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8920719 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8920720 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
8920721 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8920722 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
8920723 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
8920724 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
8920725 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8920726 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8920727 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8920728 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8920729 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8920730 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8920731 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8920732 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8920733 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8920734 m s que una carta pastoral es un libro con toda la fundamentaci n de datos y lo importante es que es la intervenci n de una figura de iglesia con preocupaci n por la tica
8920735 chile consagra formalmente una nueva mirada sobre la discapacidad que deber a contribuir a poner al d a nuestra legislaci n y nuestras pol ticas p blicas
8920736 bachelet promulga convenci n internacional sobre derechos de los discapacitados
8920737 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8920738 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
8920739 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
8920740 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
8920741 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8920742 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene
8920743 se est trabajando con la canciller a se ha estado trabajando en una especie de acuerdo con el gobierno paname o
8920744 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8920745 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8920746 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8920747 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8920748 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8920749 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n
8920750 todos los convenios de la oit sin excepci n no admiten ninguna reserva o declaraci n interpretativa
8920751 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8920752 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
8920753 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
8920754 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
8920755 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8920756 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8920757 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8920758 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8920759 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8920760 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8920761 p rez yoma rechaz duramente el ultim tum de agricultores de la araucan a
8920762 agricultores de temuco dieron 10 d as a p rez yoma para visitar la zona
8920763 todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso
8920764 en chile no hay presos pol ticos las personas que est n privadas de libertad todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso
8920765 se alaba que las c rceles concesionadas visit santiago 1 y rancagua est n en la primera l nea de lo que l ha visto en el continente no solamente en sudam rica
8920766 no hay en ning n caso en chile pr ctica de torturas ni en ning n caso permisividad o complacencia o hacer la vista a un lado en caso de malos tratos si es necesario son investigados y sancionados si corresponde

8920972 while this was clearly a qualitative exercise and not a representative survey the movement we saw in attitudes toward the election and barack obama was dramatic

8920993 we had to work hard this week on our mental approach
8920994 i can talk it all i want but the players have got to action it and they did i think the start of our game tonight won the game for us ad it was a credit to them how they bounced out of the blocks
8920995 theyre a tough bunch of blokes im very proud to be involved with these blokes at the moment and were going on a little journey here and were the masters of that destiny
8920996 i didnt think there was too much in it im pretty sure i hit his chest or ball first
8920997 realistically we should have won the game tonight were a semi final team were coming in the top three
8920998 tigers coach tim sheens has got a lot of troops there who are injured hes got a lot of people that are out we would have been very disappointed if wed come out and didnt win
8920999 the first 30 minutes we did everything wrong we could do wrong but we hung in
8921000 we want the police to send out the policemen who gave the orders and the police who hurt people
8921001 we ask them to come out by 7 00pm 1200 gmt otherwise we will bring 100 000 protesters to surround the police headquarters
8921002 my state of mind was like this could come in handy
8921003 my plan was just to film something i could sell
8921004 they were at ground zero and most of the footage that wed seen on tv was from a mile high you know helicopters news crews scanning the area for survivors
8921005 what kimberly showed us was this sort of inside out look at what they went through
8921006 i was praying and shooting thats what got me through
8921007 i didnt want to mess up the camera cause i knew what i had recorded it was powerful it was history
8921008 when we saw the footage i mean it was extraordinary
8921009 we moved back to new orleans where they had jobs available now all of a sudden

8921013 at high temperature those salts are molten and you get a chemical reaction with the metal
8921014 even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
8921015 at the other end of the spectrum gold and platinum are so unreactive that fingerprints dont react with them at all
8921016 there might not be any salty sweat present but the fatty sebaceous glands will deposit fats and waxes on the metal
8921017 but the fatty deposits inhibit that oxidation so you end up with nice shiny brass where the fingerprint was deposited and dull brass surrounding it

8921024 several months ago we carried out an evaluation of the situation in georgia and realized that georgia and russia were on a collision course we have good relations with both and dont want to back either in this conflict
8921025 we therefore made a decision to drastically minimize sales of weapons to georgia
8921026 we saw that there was a surge in requests for weapons and we therefore decided to in effect minimize the entire issue after our decision we sold only defensive weapons in small quantities to georgia

8921030 we have given way to let them back into the government house to prevent a clash all security forces have left the government compound

8921099 after numerous discussions around the league we officially released marcus this afternoon
8921100 this is a painful day because of our affection for marcus who is certainly a class act in emotional situations such as this we understand players are simply people who wear jerseys for a living
8921101 but underneath those uniforms they are real people whose hopes and dreams matter just as much to them as people in every other walk of life
8921102 ultimately what i feel is a strong reluctance to trade three or four assets to another team for a player and then sign him to a multiyear contract you trade for a guy give up three or four assets and then pay him then youve crushed your payroll and your assets at the same time
8921103 but when we held on to a guy like that you dont do it and say ok in the next four months hes got to do x hes got five years whatever it is to show why you bet on someone like that

8921113 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day

8921115 internet maps can now be personalised allowing people to include landmarks and information that is of interest to them anyone can create their own maps or use experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge
8921116 these traditional landmarks are still on the map but people need to search for them interactive maps will display precisely the information people want when they want it

8921121 all of us share an interest in sustaining constructive relations between our campus police and the broader harvard community in order to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all faculty students staff and visitors
8921122 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8921123 ive been hosting moderating and mediating meetings between harvards black students and university police for much of the last 20 years and it always stems from an individual incident when african americans appear to be the subject of racial profiling by the police department
8921124 the problem is a persistent one because theres still this unfortunate assumption that equates the color of a persons skin with involvement in criminality
8921125 we look forward to any recommendations generated by the process that will help ensure the hupd remains as effective as possible
8921126 if you talk to any student in the black community theyll talk about being targeted
8921127 i hope this committee will be able to initiate a thoughtful conversation that we have not been able to accomplish to date
8921128 this is really an effort to identify what the university police do well as well as what the areas of improvement potentially are were going to go at it as objectively as possible
8921129 particularly in queensland and western australia were seeing many school leavers heading straight out to the mines and putting university and tertiary education on the back burner
8921130 with the way of the world today people need to work to survive and tafe and traineeships often provide more work ready skills than universities
8921131 student debt and poor workforce planning is influencing a move towards more practical learning
8921132 a lot of people want to do training that gets them to the top quickly and furthering your skills later on in your career via a degree is always an option
8921133 look at me what am i supposed to do now
8921134 i am pleased that the banking community recognises the merits of the proposed combination between anheuser busch and inbev creating the worlds leading brewer and has fully subscribed to the primary syndication of the committed financing relating to the transaction
8921135 we wanted him to he knows you better he should have instead of this ending this bad after almost 2 yrs
8921136 oh yes long time ago we made it with different sauce
8921137 yes but unintelligible word that sounds like bak tell us that white people dont like spicy so we change the sauce
8921138 oh well tell him that he was wrong we loved that sauce
8921139 you think of everything from campaign finance to immigration and on theres john mccain working across party lines
8921140 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
8921141 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
8921142 this is the third time weve had dinner here and weve never had a bad one
8921143 so im supposed to be getting ready for the day and i promised my friend i would only write my review of the castro theatre but
8921144 do you want an entree with your side of sauce
8921145 im not super hungry but will join my friends for dinner anyway
8921146 we want the police to send out the policemen who gave the orders and the police who hurt people
8921147 we ask them to come out by 7 00pm 1200 gmt otherwise we will bring 100 000 protesters to surround the police headquarters
8921148 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8921149 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8921150 it is going to cost a lot of money to expand their business
8921151 when you look at their arsenal price is really their only weapon
8921152 we had to work hard this week on our mental approach
8921153 i can talk it all i want but the players have got to action it and they did i think the start of our game tonight won the game for us ad it was a credit to them how they bounced out of the blocks
8921154 theyre a tough bunch of blokes im very proud to be involved with these blokes at the moment and were going on a little journey here and were the masters of that destiny
8921155 i didnt think there was too much in it im pretty sure i hit his chest or ball first
8921156 realistically we should have won the game tonight were a semi final team were coming in the top three
8921157 tigers coach tim sheens has got a lot of troops there who are injured hes got a lot of people that are out we would have been very disappointed if wed come out and didnt win
8921158 the first 30 minutes we did everything wrong we could do wrong but we hung in
8921159 we came back out in the second half and showed plenty of spirit cronulla were just clinical and waited till we made mistakes and when we made the two mistakes they scored
8921160 i got a friend who lives up the street from nash and he said nash left town
8921161 the national hurricane center calls it the forecast cone that unsettlingly familiar graphic depiction of the projected path of a storm and the surrounding area representing the margin for error
8921162 meteorologist carl arredondo referred to the forecast cone as the cone of error stressing the variations and inaccuracies that are possible
8921163 ok most of us dont have degrees in meteorology and certificates in storm prognostication but you dont have to be nash roberts to know that when something is simultaneously referred to as the cone of uncertainty and the cone of probability something aint quite right whats next the cone of confusion the cone of contradiction the cone of complete cluelessness
8921164 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8921165 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8921166 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8921167 you better shave her a little closer before you kiss her goodnight
8921168 ill play wherever the coaches think i can help the team
8921169 ive never seen in my four years here a class as close
8921170 theyre a really tight knit group and theyre a good bunch of kids i really like them
8921171 we knew each other so well coming in and not a lot of people have that at their school
8921172 were all kids that have our heads on straight and we dont do anything stupid we understand all the reasons we are here and its not just about football
8921173 we kind of had the same mentality that coach weis had
8921174 its okay to laugh now because in the future were going to be pretty good
8921175 having guys stay at your house its more than just seeing them on a recruiting visit and saying hey whats up
8921176 when someone is staying at your house you really get to hang out really bond and get to know them
8921177 i would say the group was a rock the whole time
8921178 when things were bad we just talked to each other nobody felt like they were going to fade away but just staying close helped a lot
8921179 you knew you had a really special group because they were getting hammered every day
8921180 they were getting hammered everywhere they went by their peers in school in the grocery store and certainly by every other college in america so thats one of the reasons why you know they are special
8921181 what gets people out of bed in the morning is a question i need to answer on a daily basis it varies from every individual
8921182 i knew i was going to carry more players this year and therefore the hardest part of the job is motivating those who are not 1 11 but 12 25 but thats my life
8921183 where dean windass is concerned he just wants to play football
8921184 he said to me he just wants to score goals and he has done that so he is ticking all the boxes
8921185 do i repay him with a start tomorrow the answer to that will remain to be seen
8921186 i think you can ask the question when the sun stops shining and the weather changes and the clever beautiful game tends to become more of a hard tackling hard working mentality
8921187 with the sun on his back he is a very good player when it is blowing a gale a little bit more blustery or a little bit more wet then ill answer the question
8921188 its nice going into the game with four points under our belts so that anxiety of getting a first win or of getting points away and at home is not there
8921189 the only anxiety we have is the strength of wigan as a unit i think they are a powerful team
8921190 i think they will be knocking at the door of the top end this season they are a top half premier league team if not with a good season maybe getting into the european places
8921191 they have built their squad and added to that and the strength in depth they have now is where we want to be in two or three years time

8921203 il mio personaggio imperfetto tra luci e ombre gli esseri umani sono cos
8921204 ho amato subito il personaggio di sylvia cos intenso e drammatico e vero che interpreto quasi sempre personaggi imperfetti con luci ed ombre e il motivo semplice gli esserei umani sono cos in ogni film c qualcosa di reale che commuove e d i brividi c chi questi brividi li prova una o due volte nella vita altri molte volte
8921205 theres one thing to have police officers available and out there to enforce an ordinance its another thing to bring out 50 to 60 officers at least 10 to 20 in riot gear coincidentally around the same time that the republican national convention is taking place
8921206 so i think one of the biggest things we wanted to get out of this is to expose the fear of people speaking up for themselves in places where people dont want them to
8921207 if it goes like this its going to be great
8921208 the folks that wanted to make their statement made their statement the folks that wanted to be arrested got arrested i dont want to say its a great resolution i would just as soon no one was arrested and we wouldnt have to come down here but if this is example of how police can cooperate with the folks who want to express their first amendment rights i think everyone won on this one
8921209 yes it is a protest it is a statement but it also is a necessity

8921211 if a successful political speech is concrete and traceable to a consistent specific standard that would guide the speech giver s decisions barack obama s speech was utterly incomprehensible
8921212 barack obama delivered a beer ad for the left tonight selling the idea of having it all great taste and less filling all without the beer gut really
8921213 i found the speech to move between inspiring bold and comfortable
8921214 obama needed to do one thing last night prove that he didn t have a stick up his ass a rather blunt assessment perhaps but that s exactly what his opponents have accused him of only a bit more obliquely he s a celebrity too intellectual out of touch with ordinary people well tonight he showed them that the stick was gone he did exactly what he needed to do show some passion show some chutzpah show america that there was more to his message than the simple word change he attacked mccain hard on everything from osama bin laden to oil policy to the war in iraq he talked about reconciliation without seeming overly wimpy and he kept his message on point about hope and the future and twenty first century solutions he made a wise choice too in not pursuing the john edwards two americas angle and gunning for the rich and for wall street wise because that message is all about negativity and negativity is not what obama is about written previously often reminds me of none other than president ronald reagan it s morning in america and change you can believe in are really just two sides of the same coin messages of hope that are about looking to the future and believing in the can do spirit of america messages that are devoid of any negativity and anger obama did what he had to do last night and he did it well i d give him 4 5 stars
8921215 we are proud to once again be associated with this prestigious initiative and to be involved in recognising key women players in the film industry one has only to look at the inspiration that people such as kgomotso and the two other finalists joyce sikhakhane rankin of xoxa productions and desiree markgraaff of bomb shelter production provide to our youth to women and to our industry in general to realise the value of their contribution to all facets of our lives

8921241 last year we signed a player at midnight on the 31st and we will be up and ready as late as we have to on the 1st so you never know
8921242 there is a long time to go already there has been an acceleration every half an hour there is a headline that someone has signed somebody
8921243 will we sign someone maybe or maybe not its as simple as that we are out to look if we find the right players maybe one we will but i think we should focus on our qualities
8921244 it looks like we are one in the toughest groups because we face teams who are used to playing in europe there are long trips involved but we have the squad to cope with every problem we face in the season
8921245 porto has maybe more experience than any other team because theyve already won it and been there a few times in the final stages and they always make it difficult for anyone in england but fenerbahce are an up and coming team and made it to the quarter finals for the first time last year
8921246 kiev have always the best players in their country but they can be a very dangerous side we played against them with shevchenko and luzhny
8921247 it gives you an edge in the premier league if you qualify early and you are not under stress in games four five or six but its difficult to predict you will qualify early united have villarreal and that isnt easy neither is celtic for anybody in the premier league
8921248 owen is an intelligent player when i arrived in england he was young but looked fantastic sharp and intelligent in front of goal his career was disturbed a lot by injuries thats the luck you get when you are a great footballer
8921249 he is not just a goalscorer he can make assists and runs but his main focus is to score goals he is an intelligent runner and recently he scored headers after coming on

8921255 der erste gedanke war 6 0 gegen grasshoppers z rich wir werden sicher erkundungen einziehen wir haben mit jacek bak ja auch einen polen im kader lech posen w rde ich nicht unbedingt als wunschgegner titulieren aber der allgemeine tenor war so dass wir gesagt haben wir m ssen nehmen was kommt ich h tte eher die bulgaren litex lowetsch oder die zyprioten apoel nikosia bevorzugt
8921256 wir wollten zuerst ausw rts spielen aber das kann man sich wie den gegner nicht aussuchen wir haben eine 50 50 chance um unser ziel die gruppenphase zu erreichen ben tigen wir zwei gute tage das ist m glich die entscheidung wird in polen wo lech zuletzt grasshoppers z rich 6 0 deklassierte fallen daher wird es wichtig sein dass wir zu hause ein gutes resultat vorlegen
8921257 im vergleich zu salzburg haben wir durchaus gute chancen die man mit 50 50 beziffern kann was uns etwas wehm tig stimmt ist das erste spiel zu hause zuletzt sind wir aber auch zweimal gegen legia warschau weitergekommen von den varianten die zur verf gung standen h tte es schlimmer kommen k nnen von den finanziellen m glichkeiten her w ren die portugiesen interessanter gewesen

8921282 third quarter earnings are shaping up to be outstanding as we continue to benefit from a strong asphalt market in july alone we earned nearly as much at nustar energy l p as the entire first quarter of 2008 which already was a record quarter and august is shaping up to be just as good as we noted in the second quarter earnings call very tight supply conditions have resulted in a significant increase in the margins for the asphalt and intermediate products we produce due to much higher asphalt prices and lower feedstock costs our margin per barrel for the third quarter is now expected to be in the range of 15 to 20 per barrel in addition despite higher prices we continue to see good sales volumes for both asphalt and intermediate products we expect to use a portion of the excess cash flows from the asphalt business to repay debt in the third quarter of 2008 we also expect to be in a position to recommend a distribution increase to our board of directors for the third quarter of 2008

8921389 in his debut release for neosignal phace delivers another top of the range 12
8921390 probably my favourite track by phace evar a very untypical phace track one might say cause its so riff driven and progresses in a more subtle and dosed way than most genre counterparts it does things ive never heard a phace tune do before and yet still its undeniably phace but the most important reason why its such a standout tune is because its got so much heart so much more than most current techy d amp b its like hearing music youve been wanting to hear for a long time leaving you wondering why arent there more tracks like this and the answer is simple because magic like this doesnt happen often
8921391 neosignals first release brings the long awaited cold champagne rollers dont come much slicker than this phace bring the phunk with style once again killer every time and sick to mix massive support from the lifted camp
8921392 cold champagne brings back the phace funk from yesteryears a resurrected cut from their earlier days gets a face lift and delivers a tight blend of old phace with the new deep driving and introspective a must for any djs box whos willing to dig deeper
8921393 this is phace doing what they do best stomping driving twisting turning appealing to that part of your brain that only phace seem to know how to get to serious for me the best part about this tune is the fantastic switch from the brilliantly unusual levitating pad solo into a relentless persuasive groove that manages to breathe as much as it kicks and so the bar is set higher once again
8921394 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world

8921410 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
8921411 sen mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game

8921503 his body was found in the parking lot of a local nightclub frequented by goths although cause of death is known to be exsanguinations how his body was drained is still a mystery
8921504 if im not mistaken the young man murdered at the club is known to you isnt he
8921505 you go missing all night and he turns up dead the next morning now what do you think im implying
8921506 i already told you where i was last night i didnt kill him although i wish i had

8921514 we have a well organized tropical storm the reason it has not strengthened is because it spent 24 hours basically right on top of jamaica
8921515 it is going to move into the gulf of mexico it looks like early sunday morning as a category 3
8921516 it might be a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker depending on how much land it goes over
8921517 it could be a little stronger or a little bit weaker but you still have a powerful hurricane making landfall anywhere from that far tip of the florida panhandle all the way out into southeast texas right around port oconnor the really good hurricane models have this either near mobile ala or new orleans three of them do two others have it closer to southeast texas what the hurricane center is doing on their forecast is kind of splitting the difference
8921518 from the very beginning we have struggled to understand time matter and the infinite universe who we are where we are headed and if we are alone great minds and some of the genres most legendary writers and directors have now imagined the most wonderful and terrifying answers to these questions
8921519 there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man
8921520 believe me when i say we have a difficult time ahead of us but if we are to be prepared for it we must first shed our fear of it i stand here before you now truthfully unafraid why because i believe something you do not no i stand here without fear because i remember i remember that i am here not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me

8921525 i wrote the first draft of the script which to be honest kind of took two years to deliver because i did hot fuzz in the middle of it but i did my first draft of it just before the writers strike last year and i think its one of my favorite things ive ever written it was a real blast to write i know that marvels very pleased with what weve done and really really the appeal to that for me is the fact that like ant man is considered slightly d list the whole raison detre of the piece for me and my thing has always been to take something that would seem to be uncool and make it really cool and thats certainly the case with british cops in hot fuzz to take the most seemingly kind of underwhelming concept and make something really cool out of it i always liked that premise

8921534 like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term
8921535 we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats

8921544 yes some questions are stupid but no one will ever get smart if they dont ask questions so lets pretend stupid questions arent stupid to encourage people to get smart
8921545 the south african company is disrespectful to us as namibian workers and company owners working on the television series furthermore the namibian film commission supposedly to assist and regulate the film industry is part of the problem
8921546 i am surprised that only 41 namibians have been employed by the south african company instead of the promised 61 on the other hand the nfc is not an employment agency but a regulator of the industry
8921547 it is important that the ministry of home affairs be factually informed in which way the namibians have been disadvantaged before a collective decision is taken on what action to be taken against the company this i propose in view of the fact that home affairs is regularly accused of delaying tactics in issuing work permits and in the process preventing investment via the film industry
8921548 we have to work together with other ministries to resolve the persistent problems the film industry is facing
8921549 we are aware of who is who in the zoo of the film industry should the ministry of home affairs conduct on location checks on these foreign film companies trying to take our leaders for a ride
8921550 i urge namibian filmmakers to work together to collectively resolve the existing problems which will never be resolved as long as division reigns within the local film industry due to division you must stop fighting each other and work together
8921551 i am really tired of all the infighting through this filmmakers are bound to destroy themselves and the industry if it doesnt stop we need to come together and find a lasting solution and a clear way forward in the interest of the film industry
8921552 the research suggests that the best way of swatting a fly is to creep up slowly and aim ahead of its location

8921559 he was very poised and seemed to be confident from the start
8921560 for a young kid to get out there and do some of the things he did tonight he got my attention i think as he gets more comfortable and they start having a little bit more time with him they are going to do some good stuff he gave us fits tonight
8921561 you are doing it too fast you shouldnt do it like that youll break it why are you breaking it youve broken it im going to have to write you up for breaking it
8921562 due to the dramatic increase in huntsmans net debt and decrease in its earnings since last july their proposal does not come close to making the combined company solvent
8921563 huntsmans shareholders lack this information because huntsman has despite our repeated requests for more than two months refused to permit its shareholders to review our delaware complaint and the duff amp phelps solvency analysis if this information were made public huntsman shareholders would understand that this proposal is inadequate we are not seeking to renegotiate this transaction

8921566 the firm is capturing food price inflation with no incremental damage to traffic and holding merchandise margins both on food and overall
8921567 the relatively non discretionary nature of this business enables petm to maintain unit sales while passing through inflation driving strong consumable comps which offsets weakness in discretionary products
8921568 additionally petm benefits from continued movement to higher end foods where there is less competition
8921569 despite our solid performance in fiscal 2008 we continue to actively monitor for potential changes in the regulatory and macroeconomic environments across all of our geographic markets
8921570 in response to todays uncertain economy we believe it prudent to take a cautious approach to managing our business until the economic picture is clearer
8921571 we feel that swedish based regain records is a solid and up and coming label here in the u s
8921572 they have a professional staff and the resources that are necessary to promote and further develop artists such as pro pain we look forward to a sound and successful partnership with regain
8921573 no end in sight is a great record track after track
8921574 this was not a hard decision to make pro pain are also a very hard working band with a die hard following and regain is very happy to be working with them
8921575 the new cd offers a wide variety of styles more so than any of its predecessors however a fair percentage of the recording is also very traditional in the pro pain sense and sonically heavy no end in sight is exactly the type of album that we wanted to create this time around so we couldnt be more pleased with it

8921831 the heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick who can understand it
8921832 a team of doctors at lilavati hospital conducted several tests and said his holiness was suffering from fatigue
8921833 the latest is that all medical tests are over as of now and all is fine he is just fatigued and needs rest as much as possible

8921837 i like to think good of people but i cant think of anything good of that man
8921838 im just disgusted that he can do that write the letter it has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is guilty
8921839 i did not expect to be found guilty when the verdicts came in it was like knives going into my heart
8921840 all their evidence proved was that i had contact with the girls but not one shred of evidence showed that i killed them
8921841 will hold a noontime rally with his running mate today in dayton ohio kicking off his road to the convention tour in front of thousands of supporters at wright state university the identity of mccains partner remained secret last night even as mccains campaign arrived in the crucial battleground state in advance of the rally which will be followed by appearances at minor league baseball stadiums in pennsylvania and missouri
8921842 never mind history in the making its all about news cycles that was the import of rumors circulating today that the mccain campaign would try to crash the obama party or at least steal away with some airtime with a leak of the republicans choice of a running mate it was either tactically clever or foolish but theres no denying that it ate up some of the airtime rightfully due to obama
8921843 what many nervous democrats were hoping for a forceful challenge to john mccain and the republicans and a restatement of the message to change washington and the nation that propelled him to the nomination
8921844 unquestionably confronted two of his greatest challenges one was to help voters in emotion laden language to connect his promise of change to more earthly policy proposals
8921845 the other to show he could take the fight to mccain over mr obamas own image and the best way forward for the nation
8921846 was a desperately needed opportunity to relaunch his campaign and redefine his image
8921847 a sharp edged almost populist economic message aimed directly at the middle income voters who have been reluctant to sign up for his crusade
8921848 filled with promises of generational change and a better america
8921849 proved the greatest testament yet to the intensity of barack obamas support and the enthusiasm for his candidacy that his party hopes will carry him to the white house
8921850 said the crowd of 80 000 came tonight because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8921851 opened up an important and legitimate debate the republicans will carry on about issues
8921852 as a speech i was deeply impressed in many ways it was less a speech than a symphony
8921853 transformational speech maybe the greatest ive ever heard at a convention since kennedy
8921854 vote for him or do not but take pride that this nation can produce men and speakers such as that
8921855 i have been to eight conventions i have never seen a convention where there are more people standing throughout the entire speech because they felt this was so historic so special
8921856 direct assault on john mccains campaign slogan was effective he said i got news for you we all put our country first that is mccains slogan country first by directly confronting it obama is now challenging mccain are you saying that not only do you disagree with me but i barack obama and those that are with me here dont put country first i think thats a tough challenge for mccain
8921857 obama had to negotiate a fine line the throng in denvers football stadium was eagerly awaiting the eloquence and idealism that propelled him to the pinnacle of national politics at the same time he had to counter the republicans caricature of those qualities as nothing more than the callow charisma of a political rock star to a considerable extent obama accomplished that feat
8921858 one test of a presidential candidates strength and often his best shot at winning is how much he can mold his party in his image and rally it around a powerful argument for his election
8921859 left no doubt of his commitment one that we share to vigorous international engagement the fight against terrorism and the urgency of promoting prosperity in the developing world
8921860 helped himself thursday night but if the polls are right hell need to build his case further during the next nine weeks if he is to become the first black president not just the first black nominee
8921861 i completely disagree with bill kristol i thought it was a lost opportunity i was thinking how many times have i heard this same speech over 20 years
8921862 obama whose campaign theme is change we can believe in promised thursday to spell out exactly what that change would mean but instead of dwelling on specifics he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes that republicans mock and the attacks on mccain that democrats cheer
8921863 fell short of the expectation he would be workmanlike and very specific about helping the middle class
8921864 speech before 85 000 at invesco field was as much coronation as nomination yet for someone who is so close to being the most powerful man in the world the remarkable fact is that americans still know very little about either his political philosophy or what he wants to accomplish
8921865 added detail and context to his policies thursday some of his criticism of john mccain could have used some too
8921866 obama transcended politics on thursday in accepting his partys nomination for president during an event that played out on television like a combination of a rock concert and super bowl
8921867 in the end the stadium was a gamble that worked the size of the venue brought out the bigness in the speakers rather than dwarfing them
8921868 it is with great humility that i accept this nomination at a temple in front of 80 000 with fireworks blasting overhead
8921869 the democrats are the party that says government will make you smarter taller richer and remove the crabgrass on your lawn the republicans are the party that says government doesnt work and then they get elected and prove it

8921910 i really liked them they seemed like very genuine people and i thought gee im sure he runs a wonderful program with well disciplined kids
8921911 somewhere along the line i said hey do you want to come to the big house and play a game
8921912 but dave probably has a better pulse than anyone else in the country on who is in need of a game and who is looking
8921913 we talk a lot its another source of information a consulting role dave has never tried to push us in one direction
8921914 i wish we still had chad henne and mike hart and jake long on the left side
8921915 i like deek he is a fantastic footballer and he is a goalscorer who did very well for hibs when he was here
8921916 he is a hibs fan everyone knows that but he is a celtic player at this moment in time so i cant really go too much into that
8921917 im in the market for any striker who scores goals that was my message nothing else
8921918 none whatsoever if there was then i wouldnt have bought him in the first place
8921919 he looks like steven reid whos now playing for his country and playing in the first team at blackburn
8921920 there are players down there who can come up and perform in the premiership
8921921 theres no reason why we have to keep looking at 6 7 million players when there are players down there who i feel can perform in the premiership
8921922 vince is a very good player hes played numerous games for his country australia and hes played for years in serie a
8921923 i think were lucky to have the most recognisable and largest icon in all of sport playing ours
8921924 if tiger was not around and i was able to be the no 1 player in the world id be making half as much money as i am now because of him
8921925 i am very thankful for the fact that hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game were all fortunate
8921926 the game of golf suffers when hes not in the field
8921927 it was a fun tournament last year i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8921928 the opportunity to have one of the best fields in golf for these fedexcup events and to be able to come out on top was a lot of fun
8921929 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year i just havent been scoring the way i would like
8921930 for the first time ever ive signed someone i havent seen play
8921931 but i have spoken to a lot of people i trust in england to find out about the player and they have all been very positive
8921932 the loan moves were a massive success last season josh and sone were a breath of fresh air about the place the move was good for both of them and good for the club and hopefully it can be good for jared too
8921933 jared is a tenacious right back who is good on the ball he has played 25 to 30 games for the first team and he was dying to come here he has turned down a few offers in england to come here and that speaks volumes
8921934 three days ago i had interest from another club but i heard aberdeen were interested and my heart started pounding
8921935 my heart has been set on coming here and ive hardly slept the past three days
8921936 i watched sone aluko and josh walker playing for the club on television and they gave me the inspiration to come here
8921937 the manager gave them a chance here last season and hopefully i can get the same chance to impress i have to prove what i can do before i can expect to start a game
8921938 i wasnt particularly big at secondary school so i played as a striker
8921939 romario and careca were my playground heroes but i didnt start playing for the school team until i was 14 which was quite late i know
8921940 but i was an average striker nothing special then at the age of 15 or 16 i really started to shoot up i quickly grew to 6ft tall then a bit more and it was then that i started playing as a goalkeeper but it was a position that came to me by accident i never wanted to play there i always wanted the adulation of scoring goals
8921941 there are some stadiums you are not comfortable in but i had an affinity with white hart lane that night it was a nice memory i took with me
8921942 the grass was perfect the stadium enclosed and i felt at ease straight away playing here showed me the passion for football in this country
8921943 i cant remember how it started but when i come out i head for the goal and try to get my shoulders clear of the crossbar i do two on one side two on the other basically im saying im here and im ready to go and hopefully the spurs fans will embrace it
8921944 everyone wants to play in the big arenas on the big stage and the potential for champions league football is here at tottenham thats why i joined the club
8921945 the players being signed are players that have international experience and when you add that to the quality already in the squad we can push the top sides in england
8921946 there are similarities with when i first went to psv young exciting players mixed with a few more experienced heads its the best combination you can have and that was proved by the fact that we almost reached the final it would be my dream to see tottenham competing at that same level and we can do it we really can
8921947 its a difficult group in which every game will be like a final
8921948 marseille were a tough rival last year as they won at anfield and we had to qualify in their stadium
8921949 psv eindhoven are competitive as well while atletico will try and show the best image possible no doubt my wish is seeing liverpool and atletico make the last 16 in this order
8921950 im delighted to play against them and for sure its going to be special im hopeful the fans will welcome me well because atletico gave me so much but i did the same
8921951 i understand they will see me as an adversary as soon as the game will start but nobody can forget the years i spent there
8921952 after the storm moves away from jamaica significant intensification is possible

8921983 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
8921984 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
8921985 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
8921986 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
8921987 at the same time the sheer number of initiatives and programmes and the speed at which schools are expected to implement them may be counter productive
8921988 true improvement results from a balance of making best use of innovative ideas and concepts on the one hand and maintaining proven ones on the other
8921989 care should be taken to limit introduction of new initiatives that increase the overload and fragmentation experiences by school leaders and communities
8921990 it is clear that the construction of the tables favour schools which are already advantaged
8921991 ministers have worked side by side with union leaders to cut workload and bureaucracy to free up heads to lead their schools and teachers to teach
8921992 this report highlights the damaging impact that government meddling has had on our schools
8921993 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8921994 and i hate saying that but what i mean is like madonna she can be hanging out and laughing and then you put the camera on her and its like holy sh
8921995 it was the hardest video ive ever edited because every moment was great
8921996 every moment that she was on camera she was amazing shes got an incredible quality about her she
8921997 she came out in these high heel boots and i was going to say something to her about them
8921998 but on her own she was like id feel better in sneakers her instincts are great she has great charisma and personality
8921999 she started showing me all of her personal items from under her bed that her ex boyfriend gave her so she pulled out his dirty socks and a bunch of photographs
8922000 the necklace shes wearing in the video is the necklace he gave her
8922001 she was very down to earth and its kind of very popular for little girls in the entertainment industry to be kind of bratty
8922002 i couldnt believe how many people wanted to visit the video set and ive worked with people like mariah and madonna she was very gracious and shes very smart she really knows her stuff look whether she wins or not i think shell make a great transition from being a teen star shes very conscientious of her persona and of the crossover
8922003 you can tell by the lyrics that theyre very personal and thats how shell make that transition the stuff she talks about in the video is clever and emotional and fun at the same time you can be 18 and enjoy it too
8922004 well people have different ideas about what truly constitutes metal so maybe there was some confusion
8922005 metal isnt all i listen to of course but there was a period of time where it was
8922006 i guess it started in school i started listening to stuff with screaming in it and then i started exploring more metal myspace helped me a lot and friends will tell me about certain bands and some of the bands i like arent necessarily
8922007 i love the devil wears prada theyre more hardcore but theyre awesome
8922008 and job for a cowboy is another band i love
8922009 youve got vocals that i cant do the double bass drums the incredible guitar solos every part of the band does more difficult stuff than your average rock band does i listen to these bands and i wish i could do all of that but i cant
8922010 i was the little girl in the red dress and red lipstick and i totally didnt fit in but i had so much fun
8922011 it was awesome i lost my shoes i was going crazy it was awesome
8922012 i would love to secretly do some work on a metal bands album
8922013 i wish i could just secretly do vocals and nobody would know its me
8922014 one time they were actually listening to metal and i was like what are you guys doing listening to metal
8922015 they took a lot of their stage ideas from metal bands from like europe and they use a lot of pyro and stuff like that but they like metal they dont listen to death metal but theyre definitely not opposed to it which i think is really cool it shows that theyre not just some pop band
8922016 even more amped to be able to start playing shows and work on our new material
8922017 i couldna see him onywhaur so i turned the boat around right away to look for him the gunwale of the boat is high enough that he has to stand on his hind legs to see over it i canna understand how he wan oot of the boat he comes aff we me all the time i towt he wis awa
8922018 when i couldna find him one of the things i thought was that dogs always head for home so i even got my midder to go to our house in case he turned up there
8922019 we just want to say how grateful we are to michael
8922020 without him we just never would have found him i had climbed up on to the pier and you couldnt hear him from there and with the boats engine running you would never have heard him from there either
8922021 he goes around them he wont go in the water at the beach or anywhere we just canna understand how or why he got out of the boat
8922022 its a good facility and i wish them every success with it its making use of an under used building and is an asset to the village
8922023 it will be the last match of the season for shetland and a good chance to test ourselves against some island competition before land next year we are all looking forward to the match
8922024 were expecting a challenging match shetland have shown themselves to compete at a high level and i think shetland must be one of the favourites for the football competition in land next year
8922025 we all had a great time at the 2005 island games in shetland and are looking forward to returning to lerwick even just for this short visit
8922026 i am pleased again to welcome the western isles football team to shetland and hope that plenty of people turn out to enjoy what is certain to be an exciting game

8922028 they were quite relentless and we wondered when this game was going to settle down they just kept going at us
8922029 we got it back with two goals to make it 3 2 to them at one stage i didnt feel we deserved it at that point the way the game was going but we were back in the game
8922030 i felt we had a good shout for a penalty which could have brought it back to 3 3 but we made too many mistakes their passing moves and their crossing was exceptional
8922031 we have not been used to playing a team of that quality and with so many important league games on in the week leading up to the game i didnt feel we got a proper chance to prepare for what was coming at us we certainly know we have to work hard on defending at set pieces
8922032 we thank everyone who turned up to cheer us on and we look forward to the next time we get the chance to play the top highland league teams
8922033 we came here with high expectations but we didnt do ourselves justice it is a tight ground compared to the open surroundings we enjoyed at fort william a far quicker game as well but the important thing is well pick ourselves up we were well briefed by leighton flaws in what it would be like but we were really disappointed with the way we conceded the goals
8922034 we have the island games to think about next year once we have played the game against the western isles but id sincerely hope wed be back in this competition next year because this is a step up in class financially it will be tough to consider playing in both events but id personally like to see us back in the challenge cup in 2009
8922035 youre no better than those altruists and eagle scouts you belong with the convalescents who couldnt make it out on the front line
8922036 oh when i saw that girl ruthie she was running through the streets in her bare feet someone ought to be ashamed of her
8922037 who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8922038 shes the one who taught me about hard work she poured everything she had into me
8922039 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8922040 we meet at one of americas defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8922041 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8922042 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8922043 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
8922044 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8922045 its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
8922046 will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f
8922047 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8922048 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8922049 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8922050 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8922051 it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain
8922052 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead
8922053 we must pledge once more to walk into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8922054 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8922055 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went
8922056 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
8922057 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8922058 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8922059 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation
8922060 mr cruise ms wagner and united artists entertainment did not exercise reasonable care to select a reasonably competent experienced careful and properly equipped contractor
8922061 you have a different system in germany if you lose an arm its not worth a million dollars this is a broken rib
8922062 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
8922063 he will help the worlds weakest states to build healthy and educated communities
8922064 increasing pressure on the sudanese and pressure the government to halt the killing
8922065 how are you going to improve my life my familys life and the lives of my neighborhood
8922066 if you cannot multitask or communicate without being passive aggressive dont even bother replying
8922067 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8922068 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8922069 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8922070 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
8922071 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you
8922072 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
8922073 i hope she likes it here i sent the ad to one of my old sitters and she said she felt it was pretty accurate which sort of stung a little bit
8922074 tired of people making fun of your small feet now you too can wear big people shoes
8922075 mas seguramente aquele que encheu a vasco da gama para a feijoada do
8922076 like three or four times and just looked at her and gave her a kiss
8922077 we just kind of held each other she put her arms around my neck and we just hugged for a little while
8922078 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face

8922082 enfrentei o flamengo cinco vezes nesta temporada e foram duas vit rias e tr s derrotas nenhuma partida terminou empatada ser o meu primeiro fla flu pelo fluminense mas j disputei o cl ssico pelo flamengo sei que uma partida que mexe com toda a cidade as torcidas ficam inflamadas com certeza o fato de j ter enfrentado o flamengo cinco vezes neste ano pode me ajudar caio j nior est utilizando inteligentemente grande parte do que foi feito pelo joel isso e bom para ele que mant m uma base e bom para mim que j conhe o um pouco a forma de jogar
8922083 our investigation revealed that new york city is rife with gas stations that engage in deceptive practices where they
8922084 for instance some stations low prices are only for cash transactions not that they specify that and drivers using credit cards must pay surcharges the post has a
8922085 the events happened in new york and its a disadvantage to transfer everything here
8922086 we want to make sure that motorists arent being shaken down at the pump too there are limits to how much stations on the thruway can charge our audit will look at whether or not those limits are being adhered to
8922087 anyone who drives the thruway knows gas prices are higher and motorists are forced to pay those prices
8922088 and the thruway should post the prices from every rest stop on its web site so drivers can make informed decisions about where to buy their gas
8922089 i will surely bless you and give you many descendants
8922090 i just know those damn cubs are going to the world series this year it is going to be awful
8922091 if you win most of your getaway day games youll be in the hunt
8922092 winning on the last day sometimes prevents sweeps sometimes puts you in a sweep position but most of the time it determines whether you win or lose a series because most series are three games
8922093 im the punky staff ace known as mcmahon when i hit the hill ive got no plan i just throw my body all over wrigley field i cant bunt but i can hurl the pill i motivate the cubs i like to tease i pitch so cool i aim to please thats why you all got here on the double to catch me doin the world series shuffle

8922098 we represent wealthy investors from the middle east who wish to diversify their holdings
8922099 we have access to a pool of banks in the midwest who have more depositors than borrowers and they are desperate to fund more loans
8922100 we have a line of credit with private hedge funds who have surplus cash to invest
8922101 our staff will spend many hours matching your loan with our investors and the advance fee is our protection in the event you back out before funding
8922102 our investors ask for a show of good faith which is fully repaid at funding to ensure that they are dealing with legitimate borrowers only
8922103 our escrow department must have a deposit before they will confirm the loan closing
8922104 the investors were dismayed to see all the negatives on your credit history and have declined your loan
8922105 it appears the loan to value ratio exceeds our internal guidelines
8922106 our overseas investors were set to wire transfer your funds but their host country has instituted currency controls and there will be a delay

8922112 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8922113 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8922114 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations
8922115 the ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values and prediction errors
8922116 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8922117 we have a long history and a great tradition there and feel that it is a great home for us we appreciate the relationship with the ownership and feel that they are a first class operation
8922118 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8922119 inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development
8922120 there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8922121 were in charge of protecting the highest paid players on the field were gladiators but its not one of those positions where you get famous
8922122 play in and play out you have to have each others back
8922123 if the protection is letting one guy cheat and the other guy is supposed to have his eyes there he better be there because believe me im going to cheat youve got to be able to communicate
8922124 to me being a cornerback and having to backpedal as fast as somebody sprinting that would be pretty tough im happy with where im at but i think kicker might be a good position they have long careers if theyre good
8922125 its tough but you have to be a man about it
8922126 if i had a choice id be a kicker no better yet a long snapper
8922127 as an offensive lineman as long as youre coachable enough and you get the technique down you can play this position a long time
8922128 a kicker is three missed field goals away from losing his job if i give up three sacks i still have my job
8922129 but as a return man he sure looks like hes got a little zip to him
8922130 the next time if it did happen again like that id probably let that one go
8922131 the price speculation rent economy the waste and misappropriation of public funds corruption abuse of authority and tax fraud

8922133 we found that if e2f3a is present the animals can develop normally through adulthood even when all the other genes are absent
8922134 if the e2f3a gene was doing something unique replacing it with one of the others should prevent development
8922135 we conclude from this that it is the genes location in the genome plus the timing and level of its activity that makes it so important during development
8922136 organisms above insects have multiple e2fs and these findings dont tell us what the others are doing
8922137 we surmise that the other genes are required for adult survival under the stressful conditions in the wild we are investigating that now

8922142 i cannot answer the question why the fbi continues to use the same people
8922143 all they have to do from the defense standpoint is put enough gray into it

8922155 i am extremely proud of the hard work done across nnsa to quickly and safely tear down these aging facilities which accounted for more than a third of the building reductions this shows the taxpayers that we are taking steps to reduce the cost of maintaining the u s nuclear weapons stockpile
8922156 the success of this program is a testament to the dedication nnsa has in implementing the changes necessary to efficiently meet national security measures and establish a more secure and cost effective nuclear weapons infrastructure we are well positioned to support the future scope

8922158 wenn wir zu einer neuen strecke kommen dann haben wir jede menge arbeit zu erledigen wenn es darum geht ihre charakteristik kennen zu lernen und festzulegen wie man am besten vorgeht das ist ein prozess der viele viele monate beginnt bevor wir an eine strecke gehen
8922159 w hrend unseren simulationen schauten wir uns die charakteristik der strecke an und sahen viele hnlichkeiten zwischen valencia und montr al eine hnlich erforderliche menge an abtrieb ein relativ hnliches layout mit ziemlich langen geraden und sehr langsamen kurven
8922160 die schnellen kurven sind nicht besonders bedeutungsvoll in kanada haben wir eine schnelle kurve aber man kann sie locker voll fahren muss sie also nicht weiter beachten dasselbe gilt f r die kurven 18 bis 23 in valencia diese kurven kann man jedoch ebenfalls locker voll fahren zumindest am renntag
8922161 wir wussten auf basis unserer simulationen dass die strecke zu den bremsen hart sein w rde dies hat sich alles im verlauf des wochenendes best tigt es gab f r uns also keine wirklich gro en berraschungen wir hatten nicht erwartet dass es ein kurs ist auf dem man leicht berholen kann ungl cklicherweise wurde dies ebenfalls best tigt
8922162 die strecke wurde eher durch die stadt charakterisiert weniger durch die strecke an sich
8922163 sie erinnert sehr an das was man in den 80er jahren aus den usa gew hnt war strecken wie zum beispiel in dallas detroit oder phoenix die strecke wurde eher durch die stadt charakterisiert weniger durch die strecke an sich
8922164 kritik gab es an den schnellen kurven auch wenn dies eigentlich keine richtigen kurven sind da man nicht bremsen und den gang wechseln muss aber man kann nicht in sie hinein schauen dort f hrt man ber 300 km h das ist etwas be ngstigend wenn man nicht sieht was sich in der kurve befindet man k nnte dort ein auto vorfinden das sich gedreht hat und mitten auf der strecke steht das war unsere gr te sorge
8922165 ich war ber die kurve 18 ziemlich berrascht es ist eine ziemlich schnelle und schwierige kurve es gibt dort berhaupt keine auslaufzone es gibt dort nur zwei reifenstapel dahinter jedoch das fahrerlager es w re also ziemlich leicht gewesen dort eine richtige auslaufzone anzulegen es gab also doch ein paar aspekte die nicht durchdacht waren
8922166 bevor wir an die strecke kamen haben wir den eingang der letzten kurve als interessant eingestuft um durch die zu fahren muss man bereits in kurve 24 bremsen wir haben in den rennen ein paar wochen zuvor gesehen dass das interessant ist in der simulation konnten wir erkennen dass diese stelle ziemlich interessant ist dieser teil erwies sich als einer der schwierigeren der strecke
8922167 es war nur ein freies training erst das qualifying heute nachmittag z hlt aber schnellster zu sein ist immer sch n
8922168 ich kenne die strecke denn ich habe ende 2007 hier getestet hier liegen die bestzeiten der einzelnen fahrer immer sehr eng zusammen weil die strecke sehr kurz ist im qualifying wird es wichtig sein den peak der reifen zu nutzen und extrem zu pushen
8922169 ich habe ein paar kleine fehler gemacht die vielleicht eine zehntelsekunde gekostet haben dann w re ich nur noch eine zehntel von der spitze entfernt wir haben noch etwas arbeit vor uns aber ich bin optimistisch
8922170 ich habe lewis kennengelernt als ich neun oder zehn jahre alt war
8922171 sein vater und mein vater sind freunde ich kenne ihn jetzt schon sehr lange und ich freue mich sehr ber seinen erfolg denn er verdient ihn wirklich er ist ein ph nomenaler fahrer und eine wirklich gro artige person ich kann es kaum erwarten ihn wiederzusehen
8922172 und er hat sich berhaupt nicht ver ndert er ist immer noch auf dem boden geblieben er ist sehr freundlich es ist toll dass seine erfolge ihn menschlich nicht ver ndert haben er ist immer noch der alte
8922173 lewis ist ein toller fahrer und wir haben uns in der vergangenheit viele duelle geliefert er macht in der formel 1 einen guten job und hoffentlich bekomme ich eines tages die chance wieder gegen ihn zu fahren
8922174 lewis ist ein paar jahre j nger als ich aber ich habe seine rennen immer gesehen und gesehen wie talentiert er war dann sind wir zusammen in der formel renault und der formel 3 gefahren 2004 habe ich ihn dort geschlagen als ich den titel geholt habe
8922175 wir kennen uns ganz gut und es ist sch n wenn er da ist und ein dtm event unterst tzt
8922176 wir sind zwar nicht in kontakt geblieben aber ich treffe seine familie hin und wieder an diversen rennstrecken in silverstone beim grand prix zum beispiel habe ich kurz mit seinen eltern gesprochen es ist toll dass lewis kommt das ist noch ein bonus f r die fans
8922177 er ist ein guter fahrer er war bisher sehr erfolgreich er war in seinem ersten jahr knapp davor die weltmeisterschaft zu gewinnen das war unglaublich er macht auch in diesem jahr einen sehr guten job das team ist sehr zufrieden damit wie alles l uft
8922178 at high temperature those salts are molten and you get a chemical reaction with the metal
8922179 even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
8922180 at the other end of the spectrum gold and platinum are so unreactive that fingerprints dont react with them at all
8922181 there might not be any salty sweat present but the fatty sebaceous glands will deposit fats and waxes on the metal
8922182 but the fatty deposits inhibit that oxidation so you end up with nice shiny brass where the fingerprint was deposited and dull brass surrounding it
8922183 bombs are likely to be made from dense metals like copper
8922184 many of the schools and districts on this years improvement list have met tough challenges and have made strong improvements
8922185 i want parents and other members of our communities to know that they should look far beyond a schools ayp status to determine the real quality of education that is being delivered there
8922186 our federal government needs to get real be fair support our schools and pay for the recommendations they require
8922187 with new leadership at the school our scores rose significantly this year
8922188 im very pleased with their progress but it wasnt quite enough to make ayp
8922189 i continue to be very proud of the work of our staff on behalf of all students
8922190 we have been and will continue to be focused on the success of all children with fewer resources our staff and students continue to outperform those districts with more resources
8922191 statewide results are not surprising considering the double digit increases in achievement requirements
8922192 changes need to be made to the system to better assist schools and districts in meeting nclb requirements
8922193 we are aggressively working to improve instruction and assessment to positively impact student achievement especially in math and reading
8922194 nclb is federal law and well continue to pursue the standards set by 2014
8922195 our community expects that of us and we expect that of ourselves
8922196 the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation
8922197 the fundamental belief that i am my i am my sisters keeper
8922198 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
8922199 for sure your marriage will change after you have children it will never be the same again we guarantee it
8922200 can be used in all circumstances in which the tst is currently used
8922201 i want to be able to honor the public trust
8922202 we want cme to be unbiased and science driven and we dont want it to be influenced by marketing we want our educational activities for whomever we are serving whether its our own faculty or our colleagues in the community locally or globally to be true to the science and the evidence and not be influenced by any kind of financial industry support
8922203 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
8922204 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
8922205 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
8922206 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
8922207 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
8922208 we all agreed it is inappropriate for industry to influence content
8922209 if industry really wants to enhance the education of clinicians they should be given the opportunity to do so
8922210 but we wanted to create a situation in which they had no effect on the choice of topics or their content so were happy to have industry support as long as it is provided without strings or expectations about the course content
8922211 really brings control of cme curricula back to academic medical centers
8922212 one of my hopes is to make stanford a destination so we can hold cme programs here leveraging the wonderful cultural attractions on campus
8922213 i think right now industry is under a lot of pressure in its use of marketing for education theyre re examining their role in cme as well
8922214 as we take this step my hope is that other institutions will start to follow suit i think the climate will change dramatically to enforce that if institutions do not take greater responsibility there is going to be a mandate whether its one that we initiate or one that is imposed that frees up these intertwined interactions of academia and industry around medical education
8922215 these data demonstrate that treatment with velcade plus melphalan and prednisone leads to a survival benefit and a high complete remission in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma
8922216 the combination of velcade plus melphalan and prednisone is an important new option for these patients
8922217 we are proud to have these data published in such a highly esteemed journal
8922218 were delighted that previously untreated multiple myeloma patients now can benefit from this velcade based therapy as have patients in the relapsed and refractory settings since 2003
8922219 the tolerability of vcmp also was encouraging and side effects were generally manageable with appropriate supportive care and dose reduction as needed
8922220 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
8922221 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
8922222 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
8922223 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
8922224 on this final day before barack formally accepts the democratic nomination please celebrate the moment and lay the foundation for our victory in november by making a donation of 25 or more now
8922225 the stakes in this election are too big we need all of you we have to out hustle outwork out think them
8922226 to tell you the truth you cant hear much you cant really hear who youre talking to
8922227 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8922228 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8922229 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8922230 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush he vowed to cut taxes for nearly all working class families end the war in iraq bio 90 percent of the time
8922231 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8922232 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8922233 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8922234 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8922235 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8922236 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8922237 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war

8922283 too cartoonish for me im not the biggest fan of the old logo and agree that it needed a change but this was a downgrade in my book
8922284 we were kind of short on ideas but since im a huge soccer fan and like the dutch national team and since our team colors are orange and sorry it wasnt my choice purple i submitted the idea to base our jerseys on theirs our team name is the vermicious kenids some sort of willa wonka reference also not my pick so instead of the dutch lion on the crest with knvb underneath it we have an overly purple sorry again and we have a vertical vk on each side of each leg
8922285 as for the one photo that caught my eye its this one note the nose guard being worn by the chiefs player instead of an open u shape as was common in that era the k c player has a closed u dont think ive seen that before
8922286 when we were deciding on program elements for demofall 08 we really wanted to take it up a level and get the pundits really discussing topics that were truly relevant to the audience
8922287 we also wanted to give everyone a chance to see their favorite journalists go head to head and maybe have an argument or two as they discuss their opinions and where the future of tech is going most importantly we wanted them to be fun and i think we have achieved our goals

8922314 country people are take care of yourself people they are not under the illusion that the police are there to protect them
8922315 to pursue its tight monetary policy in order to help curb inflation and support production
8922316 keeping interest rates at this level shows that the government is ready to sacrifice economic growth and prioritize fighting inflation
8922317 weve seen some signs that inflation is slowing down but it hasnt been that long since they last raised the base rate
8922318 they need to give that more time to have an impact

8922320 owning your own plane which has to be registered somewhere and can be subject to vat
8922321 the life he lived was based on hope and bringing the people together
8922322 if you look just at that one photograph of my dad with cesar chavez breaking bread together i think that encapsulates the idea of the united states coming together for the first time
8922323 to oppose the war in vietnam he showed courage he showed vision and ultimately it cost him his life
8922324 when you have monetary tightening you do get lower growth that was expected
8922325 but its not terribly low 7 9 percent is still high by historical standards

8922329 businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers
8922330 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8922331 i dont know anyone who benefits when an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8922332 ive seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs
8922333 a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west a promise that led workers to picket lines and women to reach for the ballot
8922334 a nation of whiners tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who after they found out it was closing kept showing up every day

8922340 we have decided to protest today outside central zoo authority because people generally believe that animals are very happy staying in a zoo which is not true wild animals should be set free in their natural surroundings and all these incidents of killing of animals in zoo and the recent incident of deaths of two bears in nagaland has forced us to stage a protest today
8922341 this would boost our tourism in himachal there are various varieties of apples and apple products we are also making an effort to tell people about our cuisine
8922342 its a great fun and cool experience yeah its cool because you come to know that this place sells so many apples so they make it a big festival when they give apples to tourists and all others it shows a kind of good gesture i like it
8922343 yelagiri is a well connected town its near both to chennai and bangalore well connected roads and easy access of transportation can make it a good tourist destination earlier there were not many tourist attractions but with the coming up of paragliding facility we are hoping for a growth in tourism in yelagiri

8922345 dont start a family feud between me and the mcginty clan
8922346 dont worry diedre troy will soon sniff out another seat for you
8922347 but the funny thing is that the libs had as a candidate at the last election city of swan charlie zannino and despite all the wogs in the electorate she still retained the seat comfortably
8922348 im an alp person im a labor party person and i couldnt justify in my own mind standing against what ive believed and worked for for the past 30 40 years
8922349 even though i dont like people in the alp at the end theres a lot of people there i do admire whom i just couldnt justify standing against so here i am
8922350 the western australian liberal party stumbled badly on two issues this week which in the normal course of events should have been substantial pluses for them daylight saving and extended shopping hours
8922351 at first blush these may appear to be second line issues however both continue to generate very considerable agitation among voters getting them right is free votes in the bank
8922352 reasons on the rear of that ad are kilers especially
8922353 for too long young offenders who commit serious crimes have been able to escape the consequence of their actions and hide their identities because of their age
8922354 it is time the crime of young offenders is given propriety over their age
8922355 carpenter as good as home as early swing to the liberals stalls

8922357 his chief of staff took the phone call and was informed by inpex they had made their decision on the site of the gas project that they were developing
8922358 it is my firm understanding that decision was to locate the plant in darwin
8922359 i was told that they are still determining their position and that was the advice i got on august the 21st and no i havent been told anything different
8922360 there is no turning back under any circumstances or influence now until every inch of land is recaptured and each and every terrorist is killed or captured
8922361 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day
8922362 domestic violence affects women who are famous who are not famous women who have money women who have no money this is an issue that crosses all boundaries and it certainly affects everyone
8922363 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8922364 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it
8922365 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8922366 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it
8922367 you will hear it all i have 101 text messages between lindsay and i and i have about 60 tape recordings of dina these lies have to stop she cant say all these things to me and when i try to address it deny everything dinas a hypocrite and im tired of it
8922368 this attack feels a bit different to the 2005 one but i think it has a bit more pace to it ninety miles an hour is difficult to face i have been asked whether i was surprised at the way south africa capitulated but i wasnt really not when broady got the first four or five out with the firepower we had after that i would have backed us to bowl anybody out for 80
8922369 the core of fast bowlers available now is exciting if we can keep the four that bowled this week fit and add ryan sidebottom to that he has been englands best bowler in the past 14 months and he has got to come back somewhere hopefully we can get a group of batters too a steady couple of wicket keepers and then we will have a strong squad going to india and the west indies this winter and we can come back with some confidence for next summers ashes
8922370 more than excited im a little nervous because right now the feeling has just sunk in till now i was just waiting for the films release but finally it has released and im here so im more nervous
8922371 im very excited because we have worked so hard on the film and today the day has come when so many people will be watching the film so im excited nervous and am experiencing all sorts of emotions
8922372 in italy theyre happy but here in bedum we are much more happy because the tower of pisa is now leaning less than the tower of bedum
8922373 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8922374 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
8922375 weve been trying to secure a top class training facility like this for 25 years
8922376 this will be one of the best athletics tracks in the south of england and enormously helpful to our members some of whom even travel as far as lea valley in north london to train
8922377 this is great news for our borough and our young athletes many of whom were at the meeting last night
8922378 i welcome this initiative and coming so close to the euphoria created by the beijing olympic games it bodes well for maidstone involving more young people in sport
8922379 this is all down to teamwork by the council the school and the athletics club
8922380 this is an exciting project and were delighted to be able to partner and co fund a much needed training and race facility for local athletes and our own pupils
8922381 its great news particularly as the school has been nominated as an official olympics training centre for athletics badminton basketball fencing and archery
8922382 we take boys and girls from across the uk on respite breaks where they are free to run around in a safe and fun environment
8922383 we help the children to have positive experiences which build their confidence and self esteem
8922384 they get specific attention from a team of dedicated supervisors which makes them feel valued and cared for and they take part in many new and exciting activities such as rock climbing body boarding archery and abseiling
8922385 more than half of these children have never been to the seaside so this is a week of real fun and adventure for them as all children deserve
8922386 james found the situation very difficult to deal with and was extremely upset his first few days at the retreat were difficult and he was much more subdued than the other children
8922387 but after six days he began to become more positive about his life and had made friends with the other children he realised he did have a future ahead of him
8922388 not true they arent appearing and were never going to i dont know where this story came from
8922389 the slight increase is because of rising food costs more importantly 12 99 to feed a family of four with a restaurant quality meal remains one of the best deals around the success of the product in the last few months has proven that families believe this is a great value
8922390 we are the first ones to build a display that changes with lighting weve finally found a way to build the most realistic display
8922391 they would both look real but if you shine a flashlight on the hologram light would pass right through it while the real flower would change in response to the light
8922392 there was a temptation to bring on a midfielder i have to say
8922393 but sometimes as a coach you just have a gut feeling and you just feel we could really demolish this backline if we throw another striker in the mix
8922394 sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt tonight it worked really well
8922395 i havent done much in the last three weeks so you can imagine what i can do when im 100 per cent fit
8922396 no it was good to come back and be part of the squad again i wasnt expecting to come on so early we just combined well up front
8922397 it was a real poor decision from the keeper to play the ball in that area and you got duly punished
8922398 at first i thought i was seeing things then i went and got my other in law to tell her she was overwhelmed by it she was rying
8922399 i dont know why its there but i think its a blessing
8922400 shes not there just for me shes there to share
8922401 chris can have all the people he wants on his back deck but i ont really want people trampling on my garden

8922420 ive asked all the neighbours whether they saw him pray at the mosque and the answer is no but he played around the mosque
8922421 now he has suddenly appeared again as a possible president during his fourth and final year in indonesia obama moved to a government school which has been described as a madrassah the current headmaster kuwadiyanto dismisses the suggestion

8922429 people here read local newspapers because they get the information of the local happenings besides getting information of the neighboring places all the small and big news what is happening is that every nook and corner of the district is also covered by the local papers so the people go for it

8922436 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8922437 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8922438 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8922439 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8922440 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8922441 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8922442 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change

8922484 the politburo publicly censored bhattacharjee on thursday for his comments against strikes as per our party constitution publicly censoring someone is a punishment and the party has given the punishment to him
8922485 strikes are not a luxury but the last weapon of the working class to protest against injustices meted out to them we cannot use this weapon off and on in fact it s the states opposition parties that call strikes every now and then its their conspiracy to poison people s minds about strikes

8922529 some people get married too quickly without really knowing each other well enough some people get married because of tax es or health insurance and other financial benefits
8922530 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family
8922531 getting married is not the only life choice available for a happy life
8922532 the most important thing is that i continue to grow as a person i want to be the happiest person i can possibly be
8922533 if that means i end up staying single for the rest of my life because i havent found the right mate thats perfectly all right with me im fine with taking on the role of the hip spinster aunt to my siblings kids

8922543 anyone who had anything to do with randalls neighborhood or her gun range has their head on the chopping block i dont support that whatsoever

8922545 the existing building is 1 546 square metres and when extended the building will be 3 383 square metres the facility would include a lecture theatre for a capacity of 480 students two new lecture rooms for 288 students four renovated lecture rooms with a total of 410 seats and four design studios
8922546 at present uwi accommodates 689 students at both postgraduate and undergraduate levels in halls of residence this accounts for only 7 6 percent of the total students full time currently on campus
8922547 a new dormitory has been constructed on the ground of the milner hall of residence but this can only accommodate 150 additional students the shortage of accommodation is seen annually as the demand is very high resulting in many students having their requests denied every semester
8922548 the project will involve the construction of a new block to house 80 post grad students and the residents manager and the upgrading and replacing of the toilets and washroom facilities electrical system unsafe staircases external walkways sewer system windows and the construction of a basketball court
8922549 the losses are very bad i came home lunch time on wednesday and everything in water we clean up and we make out we start back today thursday washing clothes and friends help us
8922550 its normally good here this is the first year this has happened
8922551 it was a bizarre event you had what was essentially a stationary cloud just dumping water in that area for a concentrated period of just two hours
8922552 it was extremely localised you had bright sunshine in port of spain and you had five of six feet of water covering the highway in the claxton bay area what occurred was very very unusual
8922553 i would estimate that this would happen once in 100 years
8922554 the conditions were simply heavy clouds full of water hot sunshine and light wind which all combined to produce the required atmospheric conditions which lead to that very extreme event
8922555 this is not something that has ever happened before in that particular area
8922556 but we are going to have these events occurring more in the future
8922557 in your immediate environment when you have clouds building up because of condensation you are going to have thundershowers developing but the core of the thundershower could occur in any area if you are within the core of the thundershower you can receive more rainfall from someone as little as half mile away
8922558 between the latter part of august and up to sometime in october it is the favoured period for rain favouring western parts of trinidad thats simply because of the meteorological conditions the wind field breaks down the normal flow of air becomes very light and you have very little ventilation over the land and you get a sea breeze type of effect in addition to excessive heating
8922559 in the last three weeks there has been very unusual flooding in specific parts of trinidad and tobago starting with very unusual flooding in diego martin and the east west corridor
8922560 we have had more or less stationary clouds full of water dumping water on one point for a very short period of time resulting in terrible flooding
8922561 it is clear that the pace at which trinidad and tobago is developing that the existing drainage systems can no longer cope with the run off that is occurring because of industrialisation commercialisation and development
8922562 a lot of the problems we are having are man made where people are obstructing the river channels they have narrowed them they have blocked them people have cut down hillsides
8922563 drainage systems are not designed to deal with that kind of rainfall but that does not mean that we should not address it
8922564 if demand from the stainless steel mills does not pick up in the fourth quarter we could see prices fall to 15 000
8922565 we are in a little bit of suspense on the market it could go either way
8922566 the only issue is youve had so much production taken out this year and that is going to come back into the market and at the same time youve got new production coming on
8922567 the shocking thing is even with all these cuts it still looks like a surplus market of 27 000 tonnes for this year
8922568 but maybe not all these projects will see the light of day

8922573 thats the macro hes really good at it having a vision out in the future theres a reflection down the micro level because i think hes truly an educator he believes the experience is right now and in this moment and critical to us right now

8922591 tagaytay 5 whom a court recently ordered released after finding they had been charged with a
8922592 their rights were clearly violated hold them more accountable by filing not just criminal charges but also civil charges she said after the launching of a book by the asian federation against involuntary disappearances
8922593 this is also a further deterrent to the commission of human rights violations against arbitrary arrest and detention she said
8922594 human rights violations continue to be committed under this regime and it is justified to fight back and combat impunity
8922595 the liability of the arresting persons and those responsible for their detention is very clear thats why we referred the matter to the ombudsman de lima said
8922596 the dismissal of trumped up charges and release of tagaytay 5 is a victory for human rights karapatan public information officer ruth cervante said in a statement

8922605 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8922606 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8922607 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8922608 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8922609 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8922610 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is

8922639 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
8922640 the pc market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has pcs that may or may not be adequate to run our games without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their pc the average consumer doesnt know what pixel shader 2 0 support means for instance

8922654 the reefs of the world are at risk and hawaiis isolated reefs are especially vulnerable to stresses of any kind particularly to the rapidly emerging stress brought on by climate change
8922655 coral reefs are the lifeblood of our oceans and we depend on them for survival
8922656 without urgent action to limit carbon dioxide emissions and improve management of marine protected areas even vast treasured reefs like the great barrier reef and northwestern hawaiian islands will become wastelands of dead coral
8922657 the most important overarching thing is to stabilize co2 emissions
8922658 our goal was to work on ways we could buy time for coral reefs while co2 levels are stabilized and eventually hopefully rolled back
8922659 ocean acidification will continue to an extent and at rates that have not occurred for tens of millions of years
8922660 ocean acidification is creeping progressive and insidious a weakening of the reef structure that makes corals more vulnerable to breakage from waves and human use
8922661 the best evidence we have suggests that when atmospheric co2 levels reach 560 parts per million many reefs will already have moved from net growth to net erosion
8922662 there is hope in what came out of our workshop because we have come up with practical steps people can take that are not hugely costly and will not marginalize progress made
8922663 the most obvious thing that needs to be done is to put all efforts possible into reducing as many stresses on the reef systems as we can

8922675 ive never missed a days work in my life and i take my job very seriously
8922676 the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states
8922677 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
8922678 the claims and influence of secularism and relativism have gone largely unchallenged in irish culture and media it could be argued that they enjoy an uncritical acceptance which would never be afforded to religious faith as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
8922679 being denied the right to intervene in public debates or at least having their contribution dismissed as an attempt to protect unjustified privileges such as for example the right to employ people who support the ethos of a christian institution
8922680 people of religious faith who may be natural enthusiasts of the concept of a european union increasingly approach european developments with scepticism
8922681 we tried to complain to several different police bodies about the behaviour of west midlands police but in each instance our complaint was ruled inadmissible because we were a third party
8922682 she secretly films sermons given to the women only congregation in which female preachers recite extremist and intolerant beliefs
8922683 kill him kill him you have to kill him you understand this is islam
8922684 the reporter visits the bookshop and discovers books and dvds still on sale promoting extremist anti semitic misogynistic and intolerant messages
8922685 films inside a key saudi funded muslim organisation which claims to promote tolerance and integration yet distributes literature which promotes intolerance for non muslims an extreme version of sharia law and teachings which support discrimination against women
8922686 investigates the role of the saudi arabian religious establishment in spreading a hard line fundamentalist islamic ideology in the uk the very ideology the government claims to be tackling
8922687 let us hope that this time the police and the cps are going to pursue the real criminals in this matter the government introduced the racial and religious hatred act to protect muslims from hatred but who is going to protect everyone else from the hate mongering going on in even britains supposedly most respectable mosques let the police and cps demonstrate to the public that the religiously aggravated and hatred offences are not off limits to any section of the community
8922688 we are delighted to have louise working with us on this campaign if our elected politicians ignore our calls for change we will take this issue to court having such a prominent and successful solicitor such as louise christian on board is great news for republicans while we continue our fight to end the monarchy and achieve a modern constitution for britain it is vital we challenge these offensive and discriminatory oaths of allegiance
8922689 i have advised that a person who is being required to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch before being allowed to take public office might be able to challenge in the courts any decision not to allow an alternative which more properly reflects the reality of the modern constitution and which accords with their own republican secular or non religious beliefs
8922690 the queen is a profoundly unifying force no matter what your background what your heritage where your grandparents came from we can all unite with her as our personal head of state
8922691 the text was obscured without any explanation as to why
8922692 its particularly sad that in the 21st century we appear to have a council with 19th century attitudes id be interested to hear how the council justifies this censorship and who ordered the cover up preferably they should reinstate the complete panel immediately if they havent got the courage to do this they should at least put up a statement telling all that they have a policy of allowing censorship by religious minorities
8922693 our museum team covered part of a display board following a complaint about a small section of the wording the team agreed the wording was poorly worded and could cause offence we took the decision to obscure part of it rather than spend tax payers money on a replacement
8922694 in early victorian times most geologists still accepted the biblical view of evolution they saw the different layers of fossil rich rocks as telling the story of successive waves of creation each one being obliterated by a deluge the young scientist charles darwin right was already beginning to question this view but it was another 30 years before he had painstakingly put together the vast assemblage of facts and observations that enabled him to write on the origin of species
8922695 he used the same layers of fossils that had supported the genesis view of evolution to show the slow changes that are taking place over the millennia of earth history each small change enabling a species to the rigours of its sic environment the struggle for survival through natural selection leading to the survival of the fittest
8922696 4 7 increase in the number of students taking religious education gcses
8922697 appreciate the important role that religion plays in modern society
8922698 this further increase is evidence that more and more young people are fascinated by what they and others believe and that they can see that the world is more fully understood by seeing past the various secularist claims that religion is mad bad or extinct
8922699 overall this years gcse results strongly suggest that schools particularly church schools that work hard to raise the attainment of pupils of all abilities and backgrounds are achieving the greatest success at gcse
8922700 these figures present a significant challenge to those who would present modern society as wholly secular
8922701 risen substantially over the last 15 years from 99 000 in the uk in 1993 to 170 000 in 2007
8922702 it might be thought that the increase simply comes from the greater number of gcses being taken but this is not so the percentage of pupils taking rs has risen from 2 0 in 1993 to 2 9 in 2007
8922703 is the increase because pupils feel this is a softer option rather than the more demanding academic subjects 31 of those taking rs at gcse in 2007 obtained an a or a grade against only 19 across all subjects so perhaps it does seem an easier option
8922704 if we estimate the number of children aged 16 who attend church in england 32 000 add on the estimated number who attend church run youth clubs mid week but who dont attend on sunday another 10 000 then adjust for the fact that these numbers reflect england not just the uk multiply by 1 2 also adjust for the fact that churchgoing among young people is higher in scotland and n ireland multiply by another 1 2 and also adjust for the fact that some people attend mosques etc in other faiths perhaps another 3 000 then one can estimate that perhaps some 63 000 16 year olds are actively involved with church or religion in the uk the number taking rs at gcse is almost 3 times that number 170 000 and increasing while church involved numbers are decreasing
8922705 because of the broad nature of the rs syllabus in addition to other factors the growing number of candidates does not necessarily indicate an interest in the christian faith as such
8922706 how can we channel this interest into a real search for personal faith how can this interest in religion even if it is due to rs being seen as a softer option be turned into some kind of active participation
8922707 and the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more

8922723 that protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
8922724 trend that isolates and excludes some among various religious cultural and or ethnic groups from participating in the delivery of health care is especially troublesome when considering current and anticipated shortages of health care professionals in many medical disciplines facing the country
8922725 we are looking into this and investigating how it could have happened
8922726 the equipment is so new and we have our official opening this weekend it is safe otherwise we could not let children use it and we have no intention of closing the area

8922747 i understand that curiosity killed the cat but knowing brought it back
8922748 therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to a religious service it is impossible to be buried
8922749 there is a degree of black comedy about this and my mother who had a fantastic sense of humour would certainly have laughed
8922750 when i rang up and asked derry city councils cemeteries department if it was possible to bury an atheist in a municipal cemetery they said it was possible because there were different sections for catholics protestants and muslims
8922751 my wife asked if it meant they were going to start an atheist section and the woman said oh no she can go in with the protestants

8922766 wests encouraging azerbaijan to war will be not the achievement of military success but exactly that russia traditionally sympathized with the armenians expressed its sympathy finally quarreled with azerbaijan and thus lost any influence on it as it lost in georgia
8922767 the west imposed task to minimize the influence russian federation on these two countries i e russia never could have influence even theoretically on these countries
8922768 azerbaijani leadership has always taken balanced and reasonable policy in the hardest times of our relations but now the wounds bleed less than they bled then and if azerbaijan does not fall under influence of provocations of developed countries which will be carried out in its relations after some time everything will be good
8922769 in any case russia should forget about south stream project and north stream project would be better to be frozen for several years it is not so bad as we should think how to meet out own demands under such dynamics of gas production
8922770 besides one should not expect record oil prices as the price of black gold will increase gradually and can total to not more than 125 a barrel in autumn the oil output in russia dropped by 1 5 a month as a result of july but gas output increases as much as this amount due to the internal reserves
8922771 sanctions against russia are important as well however the issue at the first stage is a support for georgia
8922772 closing with the eu is also important which is reflected in simplifying of a visa regime development of economic and educational relations in order that students will have an opportunity to get the european education
8922773 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8922774 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8922775 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8922776 we are planning for our convention to open on monday
8922777 like all americans we are monitoring the situation closely in the gulf

8922781 the republicans cant seem to catch a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8922782 public messaging and attention to the public affairs part of the response is going to get added attention
8922783 the american people want to know the people they elected are paying attention care about them and are making decisions they need to make
8922784 the smart thing is not to poke their chests out and say what a great job theyre doing or going to do but just to do what needs to be done
8922785 there is a possibility that he could have been a people smuggler he spoke good french and was of middle eastern appearance and in his 20s
8922786 the victim was raped and brutally attacked she has very severe wounds around the mouth and scratch marks on her face
8922787 we have two photo fit pictures based on her evidence and on that of a third party who saw her with the rapist before the attack
8922788 one of them asked her to look at something else
8922789 she followed him inside one of the huts and thats where it happened
8922790 we fear hes already left the area either for another country like england or another port in france
8922791 the logical route for him to have taken out of france is to england
8922792 we have sent the photo fit pictures to a number of international bodies including the british police and interpol
8922793 we are targeting great britain belgium and holland but it its a people smuggler he could be as far away as italy as well
8922794 orders to raze the camp to the ground were cancelled at short notice
8922795 immigrants were putting their lives at risk by breaking into the chemical plant to create shelters some had been found in empty pipes usually filled with paint
8922796 the feeling was that is was safer to keep them in the jungle for the time being
8922797 she was working alone and admits that going into the jungle during the evening by herself was immensely naive
8922798 she has been through a terrible ordeal and is determined to bring those responsible to justice
8922799 had westerners become certain that the resolutions would bring us down to our knees they would have definitely intensified the sanctions
8922800 take advantage of this unique opportunity available to only one company to sponsor all of the aisle signs in the exhibit hall
8922801 this is not a unilateral process europe thinks about which consequences may cause such sanction for itself the refusal by europe from russias oil products may turn to be the most severe strike on russia
8922802 russia feels irritation with the fact that the world community supports georgia furthermore russia is annoyed that the community demonstrates its sever relation to the country in order to prevent the recent developments in georgia
8922803 i am extremely disappointed in not being able to continue in my position on icos board of directors as i think very highly of the management and people at ico and i believe the company has a bright future unfortunately i believe my ability to serve as an ico board member would be limited due to conflicts with other business and personal commitments

8922813 we dealt with two persons from new mexico who were found in yarmouth county who were wanted on numerous warrants for felonies abroad
8922814 the want of money is the root of all corporate policy
8922815 in 2000 alone 94 of all u s corporations paid less than 5 of their total income in corporate taxes the gao said
8922816 corporations are also footing less of the total tax bill in 2003 corporate taxes were 7 4 of overall receipts the lowest level since 1983 irs data show individual taxpayers forked up 45 with the rest coming from employment and excise taxes
8922817 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
8922818 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
8922819 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
8922820 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
8922821 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
8922822 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media

8922856 the obama platform leans more heavily on public sector institutions and regulatory requirements whereas the mccain platform prefers tax incentives and other strategies to promote free market activity and encourage individual responsibility
8922857 if employers are not the primary source for medical coverage will they still be inclined to promote health and wellness in the workplace if not would the government fill the void

8922860 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
8922861 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot
8922862 before we started this project we contacted multiple government agencies and insurance companies to find out what advice patients are given about driving after foot surgery and were very surprised to learn that no guidance existed
8922863 we found this not only surprising but also unsatisfactory anecdotal experience told us that patients are generally allowed to drive after a period of six weeks after other lower limb surgery but no research existed before our study to support this advice

8922865 mr speaker i have as much respect for the memory of the deceased and as much sympathy for the sufferings of the living if suffering there be as any man in this house but we must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for a part of the living to lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living i will not go into an argument to prove that congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity every member upon this floor knows it we have the right as individuals to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity but as members of congress we have no right so to appropriate a dollar of the public money

8922883 after twelve years in the major leagues i do not feel i am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes i believe that any system which produces that result violates my basic rights as a citizen and is inconsistent with the laws of the united states and of the several states it is my desire to play baseball in 1970 and i am capable of playing i have received a contract offer from the philadelphia club but i believe i have the right to consider offers from other clubs before making any decision i therefore request that you make known to all major league clubs my feelings in this matter and advise them of my availability for the 1970 season

8922887 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
8922888 drei viertel aller eltern von schulkindern in deutschland sind der meinung dass das system der ganztagsschulen weiter ausgebaut werden sollte in der gesamtbev lkerung liegt dieser anteil mit 78 prozent sogar noch h her fast 90 prozent der eltern wollen zudem dass schulen die individuelle f rderung vor allem von kindern aus sozial benachteiligten familien verst rken diese j ngst von der bertelsmann stiftung vorgelegten ergebnisse einer emnid umfrage sind f r die rheinland pf lzische landesregierung ein ansporn den ausbau des ganztagsschulnetzes im land weiter voranzutreiben und zugleich auch neue inhaltliche schwerpunkte zu setzen

8922892 eine qualifizierte berufswahl ist das ergebnis eines sorgf ltigen entscheidungsprozesses der deshalb fr hzeitig beginnen und kontinuierlich begleitet werden muss
8922893 die erste auswertung hat gezeigt dass brafo der richtige weg ist um jugendliche fr hzeitig und systematisch an die berufswahl heranzuf hren
8922894 die landesweiten befragungen von sch lern lehrern und projekttr gern haben jedoch auch verbesserungsm glichkeiten aufgezeigt die in der n chsten projektphase umgesetzt werden
8922895 die vier neuen kategorien umfassen dienstleistungs und logistikberufe verwaltungs und sozialberufe gewerblich technische berufe sowie bauhandwerk gr ne berufe
8922896 eine fr hzeitige berufsorientierung ist der schl ssel um k nftig ausbildungsabbr che perspektivlosigkeit und letztlich auch arbeitslosigkeit zu vermeiden
8922897 die fr hzeitige fundierte berufswahl gibt vielen sch lern auch die motivation sich in der schule anzustrengen und ihre noten in den entscheidenden f chern und damit auch ihre chancen auf dem ausbildungsmarkt zu verbessern
8922898 die befragung der lehrkr fte zeigt dass brafo bereits im ersten schuljahr erfolgreich wirksam ist
8922899 deshalb werden wir dieses bundesweit einmalige projekt ber das jahr 2009 hinaus verl ngern und zun chst bis 2012 fortsetzen
8922900 eine erfolgreiche berufswahlvorbereitung bedarf der zusammenarbeit zwischen schule agentur f r arbeit wirtschaft und elternhaus
8922901 die sch lerinnen und sch ler m ssen sp ren
8922902 dass sie bei einer so wichtigen entscheidung f r ihr leben hilfe und unterst tzung erfahren
8922903 bei den jugendlichen liegen diejenigen berufe im trend die in den medien und im t glichen leben stark pr sent sind bei jungen sind das berufe aus den bereichen metall elektro installationstechnik sowie bau holz farbe raumgestaltung bei m dchen dominieren die berufsfelder gesundheit soziales kosmetik k rperpflege sowie hotel gastst tten haus wirtschaft ern hrung dagegen werden wenig bekannte berufe wie etwa in der industriellen fertigung kaum angestrebt
8922904 dies soll auch dem fachkr ftemangel bei weniger popul ren berufen entgegenwirken
8922905 rund ein f nftel hatte noch keine vorstellung dabei lag der anteil bei hauptschulklassen h her als bei realschulklassen
8922906 das zeigt dass brafo den blick der jugendlichen ber die bereits vorhandenen interessen hinaus ausdehnt
8922907 brafo leistet schon jetzt in vielen regionen einen wichtigen beitrag f r den einstieg in den berufswahlprozess
8922908 zum beispiel k nnen eltern einen sehr guten beitrag leisten indem sie ihre kinder unterst tzen das angebotene freiwillige praktikum in den firmen zu nutzen so er ffnet man den sch lern schon fr hzeitig die chancen in den unternehmen der region und ebnet den weg zu einem ausbildungsplatz
8922909 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
8922910 alle bewerbungen waren berzeugend und es war unglaublich schwierig eine auswahl zu treffen wir sind begeistert von den vielen eindrucksvollen projekten zur vorlesef rderung in deutschland
8922911 am leichtesten lernt ihr kind sprechen wenn sie mit ihm reden in bilderb chern finden sie dazu viele anregungen und durch regelm iges vorlesen klappt das fast von ganz alleine
8922912 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet

8922946 they got exit stamps from the palestinian government they boarded the ships and soon theyll be in international waters and then in cyprus this is the first time ever that palestinians have been able to freely enter and leave their own country
8922947 if these were terrorists we would care but the fact is we allowed it
8922948 if anyone expects a regular flow of ships going back and forth this is not going to happen
8922949 hamas sent a message to arab countries who they feel arent doing anything saying these western activists managed to do what you havent been able to do for two years
8922950 i would do a telephone interview for the media in hebrew and by the end there would be a dozen palestinians around me who all wanted to speak to me in hebrew and tell me about their friends in tel aviv
8922951 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
8922952 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
8922953 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
8922954 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
8922955 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
8922956 in biblical sources the hebrew term the satan describes an adversarial role it is not the name of a particular character although hebrew storytellers as early as the sixth century b c e occasionally introduced a supernatural character whom they called the satan what they meant was any one of the angels sent by god for the specific purpose of blocking or obstructing human activity
8922957 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations
8922958 i like it when you come and stay at mine it realy works
8922959 i dont really understand what lewis does im just happy hes not in music
8922960 mostly its about winners and losers at least in the early phases of climate change
8922961 if youre talking about 1 degree 2 degrees hotter not runaway stuff but what were almost certainly committed to over the next 30 or 40 years there will be countries that get away relatively cost free in that scenario particularly countries in the higher latitudes
8922962 she was raped and brutally attacked she has very significant wounds around her mouth and scratch marks on her face
8922963 it is to be feared that he has already left the area either for another country such as england or for another port in france
8922964 the logical route for him to have taken out of france is to england
8922965 in conformitate cu ceea ce am declarat anterior refuz sa ma pronunt

8922971 there is also a possibility that karadzic will plead not guilty to all 11 counts as well as say that he is proud of what he did
8922972 if he refuses to enter a plea again on this occasion the judge in this case iain bonomy would enter a plea of not guilty in his name
8922973 we have not yet had a decision as to whether amendments will be made

8922978 o mais importante para dar certo a parte educativa depois vem a punitiva
8922979 the primary lack of judgement by mr harazim was in his decision to drive having consumed the quantity of alcohol he had
8922980 the impact it will have on him is as nothing compared to the impact his actions will have on the family of samantha forrest
8922981 this is in any view a tragic case samantha forrest was only 16 years of age when she was killed in a car driven by you
8922982 she was a young girl starting out in life and her family and friends have to bear that loss
8922983 you have to carry that burden of being responsible for that death
8922984 i would question why boys are not included in this programme as it is after all a sexually transmitted disease which can lead to the cancer
8922985 males can be considered the vehicle for the transmission of these viruses with the population it is not known yet how long the vaccine will protect even with the use of booster jabs protection may wane after ten years or so
8922986 by not vaccinating boys we are potentially leaving a pool of infected individuals who could spread the viruses to women later
8922987 in addition to the two strains strongly linked to cervical cancer there are other hpvs associated with sexual diseases notably hpv6 and 11
8922988 the vaccine chosen by the government does not protect against these yet there is a vaccine called gardasil that will protect against all four viruses
8922989 it is part of a wider message about sexual health but most importantly it is an anti cancer jag
8922990 it had got to the point when we had to decide if we were going to take it seriously or not
8922991 wed been playing around aberdeen for a couple of years and it really was all or nothing at that point
8922992 it was either use our grades and go to university and pack in the band or see how far we could take it
8922993 the music scene in aberdeen is pretty good but why would an a amp r man go anywhere past glasgow or anywhere past london for that matter
8922994 having decided to take the band seriously we moved to brighton because we didnt really fancy going to london
8922995 in that time our original drummer had left the band but we met tom through friends in brighton and he joined us
8922996 we had the novelty of getting riders for the first time on our last tour
8922997 there was free food and booze and you tend to run with it and go too far by getting drunk every night but the novelty wears off after a couple of shows by which point youre feeling like s and youre playing like s and its absolutely not worth it
8922998 we do like to go to aftershows as long as theres free wine and books
8922999 it was quite hard to get people along to gigs when played in edinburgh in the past
8923000 but i think this one is going to be a lot busier because our name is out there now
8923001 were confident people will enjoy seeing us we think we are pretty damn good live
8923002 het is doffe ellende wat je bij mensen ziet die dat doen
8923003 twee stellen die bij elkaar in een huis wonen en om de twee dagen aan partnerruil doen het eindigt uiteindelijk in totale haat en nijd
8923004 het programma eindigt ermee dat ik gewoon lekker bij mijn vrouw in bed kruip
8923005 was zij eerst vooral ge nteresseerd in filmsterren en vorstenhuizen later ging haar belangstelling meer uit naar kunst geschiedenis

8923009 it wasnt the normal way to do it but he did it
8923010 i think we are still the conservative political party and mccain has adapted more to that fact than the party has moved toward some of mccains more moderate tendencies
8923011 i dont think hes redefining the party ideologically but i do think because of his persona he is bringing people into the republican party that may not have embraced conservative ideas if somebody else was selling them
8923012 i dont see that any of these groups have dropped out of the party hence i dont see the party as having moved anywhere
8923013 john has never been a party guy and i dont expect him to start now
8923014 they really havent tried to impose themselves on the rnc which is a good thing
8923015 as much as i liked some of the other candidates they were in the traditional republican mold and would probably not be faring as well right now against democratic presidential nominee barack obama in this difficult national political environment
8923016 mccain has the ability to win this election on the strength of his appeal to independent voters and can help our party across the board in many ways i think we lucked out with mccain winning our nomination
8923017 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8923018 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8923019 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation
8923020 mr cruise ms wagner and united artists entertainment did not exercise reasonable care to select a reasonably competent experienced careful and properly equipped contractor
8923021 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy
8923022 everything speaks to the lack of desire of official tbilisi and washington to settle the conflict otherwise why did u s military planes transport 800 georgian servicemen with military hardware from iraq to georgia
8923023 we know that saakashvili has not distinguished himself recently by the appropriateness of his analysis and actions and we would not like to think that he was given some order from washington we would like to hope that possibly we were talking about some sort of incorrect interpretation on the part of the president of georgia of any signals that could have been sent from washington
8923024 decided to conquer the world in a consistent way economically informationally ideologically and through military operations most often by others hands the u s made georgia into a nuisance state for russia
8923025 obama and his staff relied on a social networking site www my barackobama com to help supporters find one another and to disperse the campaigns messages to a broad audience most campaigns had access to the same technology and didnt have anywhere near the online success of obama
8923026 with so many people on the roads labor day weekend its a perfect time to get our message out about the premiere of this outstanding new drama series
8923027 we are literally raising the bar by paying tolls on labor day weekend
8923028 have never had the opportunity to watch sen barack obama speak as i board the shuttle back to our hotel im amazed at how this man can connect with people the crowd of approximately 75 000 people were changed by what this man said
8923029 a lot people that are into music are concerned about it
8923030 the word is out people are aware of it so its probably helped already even though its not enforced but do i think its a good law no
8923031 no they shouldnt be allowed to be towed they should have to come over and say okay turn your music down they can give you a warning and say if you dont then were going to tow your car
8923032 i think its always better to be informed before its brought to that extreme as far as towing i dont think its cost effective for the city and i dont think its good
8923033 we wanted something that was going to have some teeth in it that was going to send a strong message that its a quality of life issue and the citizens of sarasota and the city of sarasota doesnt need to be exposed to it
8923034 you were mean to me last night the only reason i didnt get up when the baby cried was because you told me that you would take care of it
8923035 last night you know when you got up to give baby o his pacifier and you made it clear to me that i should have been the one to take care of it
8923036 um serenity yes he was i spent a half hour at 2 30 rocking him to sleep because you made it clear to me that i needed to do something to get him back to sleep
8923037 are you sure youre not thinking about the other night he slept through last night until 5 i was really happy about it when i woke up to feed him
8923038 im positive last night at 2 30 i was rocking him to sleep
8923039 i am for drilling for gas and oil wind solar nuclear geothermal and any other source of energy production to end our reliance on foreign oil
8923040 earlier this year the tour kicks of on the first day of october in the irish city of belfast and continues through to the twentieth in leeds
8923041 what is currently conveyed to the south is already too much water and the delta tells us so
8923042 its the tip of the iceberg as far as im concerned
8923043 we have completed our work and now its up to the new chairman to decide on our recommendations
8923044 we had sent them an e mail requesting for the hearing to be later in mid september as we are still waiting for some more documentation on the case regarding the procedures adopted to conduct the dope tests on asif in the ipl
8923045 we have today got a reply from them saying the hearing will not be held on august 30 and they will inform us of a date later on

8923052 eine solche baugenehmigung in der t rkei f r eine christliche kirche w re ja v llig undenkbar

8923058 id like to win the game for one the other thing is id like for us to look decent it seems that the consensus is that we were decent in the jets game even though we lost that one id like to look decent against the bears and go from there
8923059 i would love to get with those young guys and help them win because i know they are right at the next step of getting to the super bowl
8923060 i would love to be a part of clevelands organization and help them get to that next level

8923062 j kidd is going to become a player coach now
8923063 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8923064 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8923065 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8923066 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8923067 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8923068 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8923069 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8923166 ours will no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation we have stood up
8923167 the occupation of hong kong was the epitome of the humiliation that china suffered in modern history
8923168 the chinese people cannot be bullied the chinese race cannot be insulted
8923169 the century of humiliation both reflect and powerfully shape chinas relations with the west today
8923170 by evoking the people events and symbols of chinas early modern encounter with the west chinese continually return to this unresolved trauma

8923183 penumbra requiem is an expansion to penumbra black plague and is to be considered an epilogue to that game and not as a new episode in the penumbra franchise the main goal with penumbra requiem has been to focus more on the physics puzzles and see how far the current engine could be taken this has made requiem into a game that focuses more on gameplay and puzzles than the previous penumbra instalments and a game that is more experimental in nature although having a strong emphasis on puzzles the game still features a dense atmosphere a trade mark of the penumbra series in overture the goal was to induce strong fears from isolation in black plague a main theme was paranoia and requiem does its best to deliver a nightmarish and feverish atmosphere penumbra requiem is an attempt to deliver a fresh and rewarding experience and not just some rehash of previous material
8923184 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected

8923190 i think about the election and im so proud of america right now but we have to continue to ensure that everybody partakes in the american dream
8923191 but i think its impossible to make the argument that black americans need to be treated differently because black people cant get a fair shake in america
8923192 you need special public policies to level the playing field how do you look at sen obama and make that argument
8923193 we have stripped away the argument that you have to have one group of policies for one group of people over the other

8923208 it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition one of these dreams come true kind of concepts

8923252 attempting to censor free speech and creating a pathology of oppression that threatens to gut the first amendment
8923253 mr obama has now established an undeniable indelible image of himself as a thin skinned pathological authoritarian
8923254 time and again since he first declared himself a candidate for the presidency he has first denied charges against him and then when the truth came out viciously attacked those who dared to tell the truth he has shown utter contempt both for the facts of the matter and freedom of speech
8923255 call into question his fitness to hold any position where he can suppress dissent and oppress those who dare to offer it

8923308 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8923309 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8923310 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8923311 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8923312 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes

8923346 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8923347 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8923348 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8923349 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8923350 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8923351 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8923352 by adding more express bus service to downtown washington transit can become an option for more people every driver riding a bus means one less car on the bridge thus alleviating the potential impact of bridge congestion while the necessary repairs continue
8923353 we certainly respect senator pipkins request for an independent safety inspection however we are confident that any inspection that meets industry standards would disclose that the bridge is in good condition and has no significant issues regarding its safety and structural integrity
8923354 anti syrian druze leader walid jumblatt said why should we give
8923355 why should we give the syrians a pretext to intervene like in 76 when some christian villages were surrounded and the christians went to damascus and asked for syrian protection it could happen again now with the alawites
8923356 its not only that the us administration could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army
8923357 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states has specially created this conflict with the aim of to aggravating the situation and to benefit one of the candidates in the struggle for the post of president of the united states
8923358 we hoped the us administration would intervene in the conflict to stop the aggressive action of the georgian leadership nothing of the kind happened

8923362 obama also said he welcomes a debate with mccain over who has the best temperament and judgment to be president
8923363 iconic of the discomfort the west has with the social mores of islam
8923364 you americans are a nation that exploits women like consumer products or advertising tools calling upon customers to purchase them you use women to serve passengers visitors and strangers to increase your profit margins you then rant that you support the liberation of women
8923365 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8923366 it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response because so far neither the government of pakistan nor mr zardari has responded
8923367 thanks shawna i wish there had been more coverage of those two golds but of course we know what were dealing with dont we

8923369 i did check out the protest as filmed by dnc and just released by commondreams
8923370 i was proud of the way our players finished the tournament today
8923371 the loss last night against japan was extremely hard on everyone but today we regrouped and finished strong we found our focus today and played an excellent all round game

8923374 wir haben jeden tag f nf tage lang volles open air entertainment programm auf unserer sommergarten b hne
8923375 das ist n mlich das einzige konzert in deutschland von einem wild zusammengew rfelten haufen aus musikern kubanischen musikern mitgliedern des buena vista social clubs und den deutschen top stars silbermond ich ich 2raumwohnung und juli einmal in diesem jahr kommen sie zusammen bei uns hier auf der ifa 28 euro kostet das ticket das ist sicherlich unschlagbar
8923376 insofern ist die ifa der internationale treffpunkt f r medien und konsumenten aber vor allem f r die industrie als aussteller und den fachhandel
8923377 haltung und position nicht zukunftweisend f r eine liberale partei
8923378 offenbar muss sich zach erst daran gew hnen in zukunft seine positionen mit seiner parteichefin abzusprechen und nicht mehr mit dem sp klub
8923379 offensichtlich ist zach zu lange im sp klub gesessen und es ist ihm in fleisch und blut bergegangen den genossinnen und genossen nach dem mund zu reden aber diese haltung und position ist wohl nicht zukunftsweisend f r eine liberale partei
8923380 damit erweist er der jugend und seiner generation die er vertreten will keinen guten dienst
8923381 es ist erfreulich wenn sich der arbeitnehmerfl gel in der vp nun deutlicher artikuliert allerdings ist nun auch massiv die entsprechende berzeugungsarbeit innerhalb der vp zu leisten endlich der verl ngerung der hacklerregelung zuzustimmen die sp ist dazu jederzeit bereit
8923382 der menschgemachte klimawandel ist da ungebremst hat er verheerende folgen aber ich habe gute nachrichten wir k nnen einen drastischen klimawandel verhindern
8923383 alleine wenn china den wohlstandslevel der usa erreicht bedeutet das eine milliarde autos mehr auf unserem planeten
8923384 dieses symposium informiert welche alternativen es bereits gibt und welche ver nderungen in der automobilwirtschaft zu erwarten sind
8923385 um das kioto ziel zu erreichen sind aber auch nachhaltige ma nahmen notwendig z b die erh hung der realen effizienz der fahrzeugantriebe durch hybridisierung oder der g nzlich co2 freie antrieb durch brennstoffzellenfahrzeuge mit elektrischem antriebstrang
8923386 durch die kombination sauberer kraftstoffe und neuer fahrzeugtechnologien k nnen sowohl die co2 problematik und als auch die lokale umweltbelastung reduziert werden
8923387 das erste fahrzeug mit dieser seriellen hybridtechnik wird in deutschland voraussichtlich im jahr 2011 auf den markt kommen
8923388 diese entwicklung f gt sich nahtlos in die entwicklung unserer gesellschaft ein die beralterung bringt uns den 100 j hrigen autofahrer und die autoindustrie sorgt daf r dass er sicher unterwegs ist
8923389 klimaschutz und verkehr ist der weg der kleinen schritte denken die menschen um kann auch das ziel der co2 reduktion erreicht werden
8923390 das hauptziel ist dass der ffentliche verkehr sauberer wird die emissionen m ssen weltweit gesenkt werden das umsteigen zum ffentlichen verkehr ist bereits ein weg zum energiesparen
8923391 um klimaver nderungen und dem steigenden energiebedarf wirkungsvoll zu begegnen reicht es nicht aus emissionsfreie fahrzeuge zu entwickeln wir brauchen jedenfalls innovationssch be im bereich der energie effizienz und zwar in allen lebensbereichen
8923392 bereits im vorjahr hat die regierung versprochen dass die hacklerregelung verl ngert wird und bis heute ist nicht viel passiert die verl ngerung der hacklerregelung bis 2013 soll endlich umgesetzt werden
8923393 die fcg wien fordert die regierung auf dass die verl ngerung der hacklerregelung bis ins jahr 2013 so schnell wie m glich umgesetzt wird denn f r uns ist klar wer 40 bzw 45 jahre gearbeitet hat muss abschlagsfrei in pension gehen k nnen die verl ngerung bis 2013 ist ein weiterer wichtiger schritt aber perspektive muss die bernahme der hacklerregelung ins dauerrecht sein
8923394 die erfolgreiche landesgartenschau ist ein anziehungspunkt f r g ste sowohl aus nieder sterreich als auch weit ber die grenzen unseres landes hinaus

8923408 deze vergadering kan niet volledig geldig zijn als er ook geen vertegenwoordiging is van zuid osseti en abchazi
8923409 if we could set it up the way we want to that would be great
8923410 you dont have to stick to a game schedule you can evaluate and critique a young man its not a bad idea at all it would make it interesting for the players i can tell you from coaching in the nfl as a green bay packers assistant among other stops that you get tired of practicing against each other after a week or two
8923411 i think we ought to scrimmage like the pros do in preseason so you dont have 22 starters out there at the same time with great risk
8923412 it would improve the energy in practice preparing for somebody
8923413 you can be careful from injuries in preseason all you want and then you question whether youre ready or not
8923414 youre looking to grade your team and its hard to do it against yourselves
8923415 our last scrimmage it was kind of a marshmallow contest our defense didnt go full speed and neither did our offensive guys
8923416 we should be able to do something about bringing in a d 1 aa team for practice
8923417 with all the money weve got coming in in the sec we should be able to bring a team in for couple of days put them in a dorm and work out with them
8923418 id be completely opposed to that because we have classes
8923419 we have enough media and internet coverage what happens when a freshman drops a ball
8923420 we have the credentials to back us up were soldiers
8923421 he was able to talk to them a little bit
8923422 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
8923423 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
8923424 style is knowing who you are what you want to say and not giving a damn
8923425 perfume is like love you can never get enough of it
8923426 yesterday is history tomorrow is mystery today is a gift
8923427 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
8923428 it might be unfair calling jessica simpsons show at the avalon ballroom wednesday a train wreck at some point a train knows where its going
8923429 hes a very good player and as juande ramos has said many times were delighted hes with us
8923430 i dont really want to comment about speculation but we just hope hes going to stay
8923431 we will comment and will let you know when weve got news
8923432 its difficult for me to comment on different rumours and speculation
8923433 he plays for another club we respect and they have got a game tonight
8923434 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
8923435 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
8923436 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
8923437 things didnt happen the way we wanted but youve got to expect that out of any football game
8923438 especially when youre playing such a good opponent like miami
8923439 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
8923440 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays
8923441 it felt like we had a junior or senior out there playing quarterback
8923442 hindu and christian peace committees have been meeting and the leaders have appealed for calm
8923443 hey all of these guys are right so what are they actually arguing about should be easy to be on the same page when you look at the end result of great strategy and design
8923444 guys who cares about disciplines and terminology battles or having a seat at the table its all too human to care most about where you come from but when everything grows together it helps to forget analytical thinking vs design thinking accept the fact that it takes all kinds of differently thinking people and dont tell me designers dont think or planners arent creative if that is the case you probably have designers who arent curious enough and planners who arent creative enough or you are the problem so the upshot is no matter if you consider yourself a strategist or designer of experiences steal with pride from and partner with all disciplines as long as you start and end with human behavior as the core driver of what you do also try to stop worrying about who is doing what and in what type of agency or shop get rid of those hierarchical ramifications of seperating strategy and design or what and how i for one cannot always seperate if what an experience planner does is already design or if what a designer does sometimes is a strategy
8923445 the key idea behind the knol project is to highlight authors books have authors names right on the cover news articles have bylines scientific articles always have authors but somehow the web evolved without a strong standard to keep authors names highlighted we believe that knowing who wrote what will significantly help users make better use of web content
8923446 information literacy empowers people in all walks of life to seek evaluate use and create information effectively to achieve their personal social occupational and educational goals it is a basic human right in a digital world and promotes social inclusion in all nations
8923447 there was a mistake in a recipe for apple cake instead of calling for two pinches of nutmeg it said 20 nutmeg nuts were needed
8923448 we know that four adults ate one cake made from this recipe and they didnt feel well
8923449 at first we thought this would be enough because we didnt really think anyone would bake or eat this cake since so much nutmeg would give it a horrible bitter taste and because it is simply not that easy to get hold of that much nutmeg

8923457 la solidaridad y la justicia social van de la mano y son factores claves para avanzar como pa s por el camino hacia la paz
8923458 esa paz que anhelamos y que ser fruto maduro del entramado de la justicia y la solidaridad pero que depender para alcanzar dicha madurez del esfuerzo que cada uno de nosotros realice para modificar en s y junto a los dem s las causas profundas que generan la pobreza y la exclusi n y sus dolorosas consecuencias
8923459 en nuestro pa s la solidaridad es un valor enraizado en el pueblo

8923577 am meisten berraschte es uns dass unterschiedliche pluripotente stammzellen zu denen auch die so genannten und in deutschland kontrovers diskutierten embryonalen stammzellen geh ren untereinander sehr hnlich sind w hrend andere stammzelltypen wie z b die stammzellen die aus gehirngewebe gewonnen werden k nnen voneinander sehr verschieden sind

8923580 wir haben uns daf r entschieden alles als open source und mit verkn pfungen zum weltweit freien online lexikon wikipedia bereit zu stellen

8923588 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8923589 according to congressional quarterlys voting studies in 2007 mccain voted in line with the presidents position 95 percent of the time the highest percentage rate for mccain since bush took office and voted in line with his party 90 percent of the time however mccains support of president bushs position has been as low as 77 percent in 2005 and his support for his partys position has been as low as 67 percent 2001

8923593 obama will cut income taxes by 1 000 for working families to offset the payroll tax they pay

8923595 now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses and the time to protect social security for future generations and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons

8923671 its too early to speculate on the nationality of the airman or the circumstances of his death there were allied australian and american and japanese airmen who would have been flying over the area in the war

8923675 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their supervisors
8923676 therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their supervisors
8923677 i think that those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said that they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8923678 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8923679 i dont think there is anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8923680 certainly there is potential there because physically the russian navy is operating in the black sea so is the united states navy and so are other navies quite frankly that live in that part of the world

8923753 todays determination by the commerce department against illegal stainless steel pipe imports from china is good news as a first step in this case to enforce fair trade laws that protect american family supportive jobs the usw and the companies who employ our members will continue to vigorously battle chinas predatory trade practices
8923754 over the past decade the chinese have massively expanded both their stainless flat rolled and pipe capacity after 2005 they ramped up exports of that excess capacity at prices well below u s market prices
8923755 we are a family owned business providing good jobs in efficient plants in central wisconsin and kentucky while demand for these products increased in the past several years because of a stronger economy we have seen domestic industry shipments fall as imports from china surged into the market
8923756 chinese pipe producers and importers failed to adjust prices for the big changes in stainless raw material inputs like chrome nickel and molybdenum this is clearly unfair trade as the raw steel input costs are essentially world commodity prices and do not vary substantially from country to country
8923757 the imposition of these dumping duties will literally level the playing field for our workers and give us a chance to compete with imports from china that are forced to be fairly traded
8923758 this is my third case on pipe and tube against china in the past year in 2007 2 7 million tons of steel pipe and tube entered from china almost one out of two tons of steel imports from china we have obtained orders against imports of circular welded steel pipe and light walled rectangular tubing from china and i remain confident that we will obtain dumping and countervailing duty orders on stainless steel pipe in early 2009 the doc and itc are doing their jobs in enforcing the trade laws and american industry and workers are prepared to do their jobs to compete in a global marketplace governed by unfair trade rules

8923834 simon hasnt noticed another human being ever so the answer is no
8923835 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8923836 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves
8923837 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8923838 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8923839 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8923840 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went
8923841 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
8923842 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8923843 under any scenario were going to see more nuclear power because its just going to be more cost effective once theres a price on carbon
8923844 in the past decade several police departments around the country have adopted programs using mobile video recording technology or video cameras mounted in their police cruisers
8923845 although the programs initially encountered some resistance as big brother oversight departments with successful programs report that video cameras have cut down on litigation and liability costs as well as improved relationships between officers and citizens during encounters
8923846 the cost of the hardware ranges from 3 900 to 6 300 per car for cameras that do not have wireless uploading capability
8923847 it catches law violations on film creates an objective record of encounters between officers and citizens and serves as an evidentiary tool in court for both criminal and civil cases
8923848 one of the chiefs priorities has been to implement technology for officers
8923849 so incrementally wed like to push for more of a presence of in car video surveillance as well
8923850 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8923851 i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8923852 washington has been talking about oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8923853 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day senator mccain took office
8923854 since canada is our 1 supplier us election obama shares a vision and plan to fulfill americas promise
8923855 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8923856 we need to look at our brothers overseas most asian countries are still facing serious problems with democracy we have to learn especially in order not to experience the difficulties of what they have gone through
8923857 despite the chinese economic huge development as long as there is no media freedom in that country the nation can not truly progress forward
8923858 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course
8923859 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8923860 the fact is that u s soldiers were indeed in the area of conflict during the hostilities
8923861 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8923862 we have serious reasons to believe that american soldiers were right at the heart of the military action this would have implications for american domestic policy if this is confirmed we will have grounds to suspect that somebody in the u s has created this conflict to aggravate the situation and create a competitive advantage for one of the presidential candidates
8923863 the fact is that u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8923864 then it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their supervisors therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their supervisors
8923865 we have a lot to learn from american colleagues about media control and manipulation
8923866 as far as the perception of these events by the general public goes it depends not only on politicians but also on how artful they are in controlling the mass media and our american colleagues do this much better than we do theres a lot we can learn from them
8923867 we didnt attack anyone we were attacked and therefore we need guarantees that we wont be attacked again and that our citizens wont be killed they are trying to present us as aggressors
8923868 on 7 august at 14 42 the georgian peacekeepers left the headquarters of the peacekeeping forces under the pretext that theyd received orders from their commanders to leave their posts and they never returned
8923869 at 22 35 a massive bombardment of tsklhinval started at 22 50 the transfer of georgian ground troops started to the combat area at the same time georgian field hospitals were set up
8923870 and at 23 30 the brigadeer general commanding the georgian peacekeeping forces announced that georgia has declared a war against south ossetia they announced this publicly looking straight into the tv cameras
8923871 at that point we tried to contact the georgian leadership but everyone refused to talk to us
8923872 at 12 45 am on the 8th of august the georgian commander repeated his statement so who attacked whom
8923873 for eight years while i was president i often heard one and the same question what place does russia think it should occupy in the world we are a peace loving state and want to cooperate with all our neighbors and the other states but if someone thinks they can just come in and kill us and that our place is in the cemetery these people should think of the consequences of such policies
8923874 what was that gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8923875 we have been looking for the holder of the passport but havent been able to find him we know that he is a resident in the state of texas
8923876 all serbs should be placed in nazi style concentration camps
8923877 he knew about croatia and the croat problems already at the time of yugoslavia when he was in contact with the president of the croat brotherhood community bernard luketic and with the president of the croat national council mate mestrovic but i think what influenced him most was the speech i held in little rock before just elected president bill clinton who invited the american minorities for conversation
8923878 at that gathering organized by clinton we agreed that luketic speaks about the situation in croatia and since i am from bosnia and herzegovina i spoke about the situation in bosnia in 45 minutes i explained why the bridges in belgrade serbia must be bombarded how to stop serb forces in bih i think that made a strong impression upon biden
8923879 it was all clear to them because we have engaged one former congressman back in 1987 to lobby for croatia for croatias independence that is long before milosevic showed up anywhere long before the wars that were used to rip jugoslavia apart in the 1990s
8923880 the serbian editors would cut out everything that was croatian
8923881 we had no one to complain to so i turned to the foreign policy board of the senate yes i complained directly to biden
8923882 biden trusted him because he was also a roman catholic
8923883 we have been meeting many times since and he often asked for my opinion we simply became close
8923884 strong anti milosevic views which tie him to the republican presidential candidate john mccain
8923885 in may 1999 biden and mccain submitted a resolution to the senate proposing the use of ground forces against milosevic
8923886 he is against russia returning to the positions contrary to the western ones in regards to georgia he realized this was not a marginal issue but an attempt of testing the resolve of the western policy

8923903 auf die staatlichen prinzipien wird leider von den verantwortlichen politikern zu leichtfertig verzichtet und so besteht die gefahr dass die wirtschaft zu viel einfluss bekommt
8923904 der beamtenstatus verpflichtet den lehrer zu neutralit t und unbestechlichkeit und sch tzt somit vor allem die sch ler und bildung als gemeingut

8923911 it seemed pointless to even go there unless we were going to do something to make these songs our own we had to find an emotional connection its a testament to the songs themselves that they keep getting redone but that makes it tricky too we played around a lot with different tempos and feels pushed the songs in different directions

8923955 eine moschee ist nicht der richtige ort f r integration im gegenteil hier wird weiter ausgegrenzt mit dem k lner bau werden parallelgesellschaften betoniert
8923956 herr schramma sitzt einer utopie auf wenn er ernsthaft glaubt der bau werde bald eine k lsche moschee sein das wird niemals so sein die m chtige moschee mit ihren 55 meter hohen minaretten wird in k ln kaum als zeichen f r verst ndigung verstanden werden sondern als symbol der neuen macht der muslime

8923976 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
8923977 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
8923978 i travel the world doing shows and people hate the united states because of the policies of george bush
8923979 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos
8923980 we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico

8923990 its a difficult group in which every game will be like a final
8923991 marseille were a tough rival last year as they won at anfield and we had to qualify in their stadium
8923992 psv eindhoven are competitive as well while atletico will try and show the best image possible no doubt my wish is seeing liverpool and atletico make the last 16 in this order
8923993 im delighted to play against them and for sure its going to be special im hopeful the fans will welcome me well because atletico gave me so much but i did the same
8923994 i understand they will see me as an adversary as soon as the game will start but nobody can forget the years i spent there
8923995 i wasnt particularly big at secondary school so i played as a striker
8923996 romario and careca were my playground heroes but i didnt start playing for the school team until i was 14 which was quite late i know
8923997 but i was an average striker nothing special then at the age of 15 or 16 i really started to shoot up i quickly grew to 6ft tall then a bit more and it was then that i started playing as a goalkeeper but it was a position that came to me by accident i never wanted to play there i always wanted the adulation of scoring goals
8923998 there are some stadiums you are not comfortable in but i had an affinity with white hart lane that night it was a nice memory i took with me
8923999 the grass was perfect the stadium enclosed and i felt at ease straight away playing here showed me the passion for football in this country
8924000 i cant remember how it started but when i come out i head for the goal and try to get my shoulders clear of the crossbar i do two on one side two on the other basically im saying im here and im ready to go and hopefully the spurs fans will embrace it
8924001 everyone wants to play in the big arenas on the big stage and the potential for champions league football is here at tottenham thats why i joined the club
8924002 the players being signed are players that have international experience and when you add that to the quality already in the squad we can push the top sides in england
8924003 there are similarities with when i first went to psv young exciting players mixed with a few more experienced heads its the best combination you can have and that was proved by the fact that we almost reached the final it would be my dream to see tottenham competing at that same level and we can do it we really can
8924004 theres no long boat rides to get out to the reef which means more time exploring below the surface rather than getting there and back

8924079 the manager gave them a chance here last season and hopefully i can get the same chance to impress i have to prove what i can do before i can expect to start a game
8924080 we havent got the biggest squad in the world and its important we keep people fit and playing
8924081 harrys very much aware of that we dont want it to be something thats going to affect back on our league form
8924082 i like deek he is a fantastic footballer and he is a goalscorer who did very well for hibs when he was here
8924083 he is a hibs fan everyone knows that but he is a celtic player at this moment in time so i cant really go too much into that
8924084 im in the market for any striker who scores goals that was my message nothing else
8924085 none whatsoever if there was then i wouldnt have bought him in the first place
8924086 he looks like steven reid whos now playing for his country and playing in the first team at blackburn
8924087 there are players down there who can come up and perform in the premiership
8924088 theres no reason why we have to keep looking at 6 7 million players when there are players down there who i feel can perform in the premiership
8924089 vince is a very good player hes played numerous games for his country australia and hes played for years in serie a
8924090 i think were lucky to have the most recognisable and largest icon in all of sport playing ours
8924091 if tiger was not around and i was able to be the no 1 player in the world id be making half as much money as i am now because of him
8924092 i am very thankful for the fact that hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game were all fortunate
8924093 the game of golf suffers when hes not in the field
8924094 it was a fun tournament last year i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8924095 the opportunity to have one of the best fields in golf for these fedexcup events and to be able to come out on top was a lot of fun
8924096 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year i just havent been scoring the way i would like
8924097 the government already forces us to pay save for lots of things already one for retirement
8924098 i enjoy studying its a total contrast to football and helps me to relax
8924099 the masters degree is very tough but im just as determined to pass that as i am to be successful with stoke city
8924100 i have to study every day to keep up with the workload i usually get stuck into it in the afternoons after training
8924101 my studies may lead to an alternative career sometime in the future or they might not but if i pass it will be something i will have achieved and can be proud of
8924102 i watched them play liverpool on the television and they should not have lost they looked a very good team but i expect we will be saying that before every game in this league
8924103 but im a very positive person and i think about what we can do to our opponents rather than what they can do to us weve got a good team here and we will match them
8924104 it was my dream to play in the premier league and thats why i came here i left a great club in wolverhampton wanderers and the first few weeks with stoke have been wonderful
8924105 ive played with players like jay jay okocha and kanu for nigeria and also played against a lot of the best players in the world
8924106 i had to man mark ronaldinho when we played against brazil a couple of years ago he was different gravy and a fantastic player but i stuck to my task and didnt do too badly
8924107 i only look forward to playing against the gerrards and lampards there is no fear i will give all ive got to help stoke stay in the premier league and i believe that will happen
8924108 lindsay parsons stoke scout has watched middlesbrough twice and says they are a much better side than they were last season
8924109 he says they are bigger and stronger and have loads of legs in midfield they have got some very good players
8924110 im not surprised because gareth southgate is a smashing lad ive warmed to him over the period ive got to know him hes got a good club with a sound chairman who gives his managers time
8924111 but our preparations are going well and i know we will have good support up there the players are looking forward to it and we will have a right good go
8924112 we went over a few things from the game at southampton weve put it to bed and had a very bright training session and now we look forward
8924113 there were things we needed to address no doubt about it but it will make players stronger to have gone over it again and to make sure we dont take our foot off the pedal again
8924114 its a lesson and a wee warning that we can never cut off the commitment levels that we put in to get us where we are just now in the league
8924115 therefore i would say to the birmingham fans after the result the other night dont panic
8924116 i dont read the papers as far as im concerned i just get on with my job
8924117 i speak to owner patrick cryne on a daily basis and have definitely not been given that ultimatum
8924118 in my view thats inaccurate i dont know where thats come from
8924119 i dont know a chairman in the world who puts a number of games on it its something made up in the press
8924120 dies ist ein kleiner schritt f r einen menschen ein gro er schritt f r die menschheit

8924128 except that the egg and sperm packets rise underwater to the surface rather than fall to the ground
8924129 an increase in water temperature of just a couple degrees celsius results in visible damage to adult corals and their offspring
8924130 corals are most vulnerable when they are very small and our protected nursery will help them to get through the first critical days
8924131 poachers often collect wild corals to satisfy the demand for aquariums but aquarium professionals are looking for alternative less destructive sources of these animals secores goal is to develop methods to eventually breed corals in captivity thereby reducing some of the pressure to collect corals from the wild
8924132 we are starting by raising juveniles from wild caught eggs and sperm which enables us to provide aquariums with the corals they desire without damaging wild adult colonies in return the aquarium operators help us to perform the experiments and give us tips on how to raise adult corals in captivity which is something they are very good at
8924133 our concern about coral reef damage has brought us a new awareness of the harm caused by reef fish feeding by ceasing to sell fish food we will hopefully not only reduce supply but also raise consciousness about the damage wrought
8924134 the world is interconnected business and the environment must go hand in hand
8924135 corals unique mission driven partnership with leisure pro affords the opportunity to reach active people who care deeply about the environment coral was originally founded by passionate divers and the dive community continues to be one of our key conservation partners around the world
8924136 err tica pol tica que ha hundido la econom a del pa s
8924137 john mccain ha votado con bush el 90 de las veces
8924138 estamos aqu porque amamos demasiado a este pa s como para intentar que los pr ximos cuatro a os no sean como los ocho ltimos
8924139 es el momento de cambiar ee uu y por eso me presento al cargo de presidente
8924140 mccain no es presidente indicado para este pa s porque su labor ser una extensi n de la pol tica que bush ha desarrollado en la casa blanca durante los ltimos ocho a os
8924141 la pol tica exterior de bush y mccain ha despilfarrado el legado construido por generaciones de americanos dem cratas y republicanos y nosotros nos disponemos a recomponer ese legado
8924142 mccain no se mofa de la situaci n actual de ee uu m s bien parece que no entiende la realidad que nos ha tocado vivir
8924143 la creencia de que podemos lograr todo lo que nos propongamos es lo que ha caracterizado a este pa s pero ahora esta creencia est en peligro porque estamos en un momento de guerra nuestra econom a est agitada y el sue o americano est de nuevo bajo amenaza

8924151 putusan kppu ini sangat sulit dipahami karena putusan tersebut tidak konsisten dan membingungkan
8924152 kppu nampaknya melakukan spekulasi atas apa yang mungkin akan terjadi karena kppu tidak dapat menemukan bukti yang menunjukkan dampak terhadap pasar pada saat ini
8924153 dalam beberapa hari mendatang kami akan mempelajari putusan ini dengan seksama mengevaluasi pilihan yang tersedia bagi kami berdasarkan hukum indonesia dan mengambil tindakan apapun yang kami rasa perlu untuk memastikan kepentingan sah kami terlindungi
8924154 keputusan ini lucu seharusnya jika pihak astro mendapat perlindungan bagaimana dengan kami kalau dilihat dari laporan keuangan kami memang untung setiap tahun tapi banyak kan pelanggan kami yang pindah ke operator lain coba seandainya dihitung satu orang misalnya berlangganan 100 ribu per bulan dan ada 50 orang yang pindah

8924163 i know what we have out there i cannot dive without seeing abandoned gear its everywhere
8924164 abandoned nets drown marine mammals hundreds of coastal birds suffer injury when they become entangled in fishing line or when they ingest hooks
8924165 marine mammals including the federally threatened southern sea otter are injured or killed with wounds from entanglement or with obstructed or perforated intestines from swallowed hooks and line
8924166 if president bush does what no world leader has ever done before fully protect these colossal areas of shallow and deep coral reefs seamounts and other vulnerable marine ecosystems in the pacific ocean now and forever
8924167 two years ago president bush shook the world when he made the northwestern hawaiian islands a marine national monument and what was then the worlds largest no take marine reserve
8924168 he gifted americans and the world by protecting life in an incredible area of ocean 1 200 miles long and 100 miles wide
8924169 if the president ultimately acts to protect these amazing areas of ocean to the fullest extent
8924170 his conservation legacy will rival that of president teddy roosevelt leadership in protecting our planet can and must come from republicans and democrats alike
8924171 the fate of our oceans is far more important than partisan politics
8924172 by using his presidential powers under the antiquities act and other statutes to fully protect ocean areas like he did in hawaii president bush could write a new chapter in the history of conservation
8924173 this could be the best thing ever for ocean conservation these vast pacific areas are nearly three times the size of texas
8924174 indeed theyre bigger than mexico countless seabirds dolphins fishes corals and tiny things as yet undiscovered could survive as a result free of the threats that are eliminating them elsewhere if the president gives full protection to these areas i am thrilled that president bush is considering this

8924190 en este vestuario tenemos muchas ganas de hacer cosas grandes y de confiar en nosotros mismos as que los equipos que nos toquen nos dan igual porque confiamos en nosotros mismos y nos toque quien nos toque lo afrontaremos de la misma manera

8924195 supuestamente se resuelve estoy pensando mucho en las cifras que se est n hablando me parece que mi pase decay mucho tanto para el club como por mi contrato lo del hamburgo estaba pr cticamente hecho hasta que rub n schwartz su representante me dijo que era mejor la opci n de espa a tanto por la cultura como por el idioma la diferencia entre un club y otro es grande pero no tanto

8924199 hay que empezar de la mejor manera para lo que viene que es algo muy intenso e importante nuestra mente est en pelear arriba hay grand simos equipos pero estamos demostrando que paso a paso podemos estar arriba
8924200 hay varios equipos que aunque tengan competiciones exigentes tienen buenas plantillas y no se van a resentir quitando a real madrid y barcelona vamos a ser varios equipos en la pelea y la liga va a ser muy complicada confiamos en nosotros y vamos a luchar a muerte
8924201 creo que en todas las competiciones hay que salir a ganar e intentar hacer las cosas bien adem s el sevilla la ha ganado y es un equipo fuerte de la competici n

8924252 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8924304 the sensitivity of the near surface weather variables and small scale convection to soil moisture for western kentucky was investigated with the aide of the mm5 penn state ncar mesoscale atmospheric model for three different synoptic conditions in june 2006 the model was initialized with fnl reanalysis from ncep containing soil moisture data calculated with the noah land surface model dry and wet experiments were performed in order to find the influence of soil moisture specification on boundary layer atmospheric variables dry experiments showed less available atmospheric moisture between 2 and 6 g kg 1 at near surface levels during all synoptic events consistent with slightly deeper boundary layers higher lifting condensation levels and a larger bowen ratio as expected precipitation rates were generally smaller than those of the control simulation however during a moderately strong synoptic event in early june the dry experiments displayed larger precipitation rates compared to the control experiment up to 5 mm in 3 hr as the soil volumetric fraction was decreased from 0 05 to 0 15 m 3 m 3 with respect to the control simulation precipitation rates in wet experiments were also modulated by characteristics of synoptic conditions in early june precipitation rates slightly were larger than the control run from 0 2 mm 3 h 1 to 1 4 mm 3 h 1 while in the other periods precipitation was reduced significantly both dry and wet anomaly experiments experienced reduced precipitation for different reasons it was found lifting condensation level cape and low bowen ratio were not sensitive markers of changes in soil moisture equivalent potential temperature was a better indicator of precipitation changes among all experiments the controlling factor in these responses was the soil moisture content forcing vertical velocities thermodynamic conditions such as local stability played a less substantial role in controlling the precipitation processes it was found that the response of planetary boundary layer variables under a variety of soil moisture conditions can be modified due to degree of synoptic forcing weak to moderate forcing favored convection while strong synoptic forcing tended to suppress it under dry soil moisture conditions wetter soils did not produce a response in horizontal wind fields as large as under the drier soils

8924307 the reefs of the world are at risk and hawaiis isolated reefs are especially vulnerable to stresses of any kind particularly to the rapidly emerging stress brought on by climate change
8924308 coral reefs are the lifeblood of our oceans and we depend on them for survival
8924309 without urgent action to limit carbon dioxide emissions and improve management of marine protected areas even vast treasured reefs like the great barrier reef and northwestern hawaiian islands will become wastelands of dead coral
8924310 the most important overarching thing is to stabilize co2 emissions
8924311 our goal was to work on ways we could buy time for coral reefs while co2 levels are stabilized and eventually hopefully rolled back
8924312 ocean acidification will continue to an extent and at rates that have not occurred for tens of millions of years
8924313 ocean acidification is creeping progressive and insidious a weakening of the reef structure that makes corals more vulnerable to breakage from waves and human use
8924314 the best evidence we have suggests that when atmospheric co2 levels reach 560 parts per million many reefs will already have moved from net growth to net erosion
8924315 there is hope in what came out of our workshop because we have come up with practical steps people can take that are not hugely costly and will not marginalize progress made
8924316 the most obvious thing that needs to be done is to put all efforts possible into reducing as many stresses on the reef systems as we can
8924317 we are supposed to take drastic action against whosoever indulges in violence

8924340 im really mad about the way this thing is going
8924341 we are in the time period within the contract that gives us the opportunity of eliminating or alleviating the effects of the layoff why theyre going around scaring people is beyond me
8924342 its managements prerogative in terms of what they run as columns or what they dont run as columns but seniority must be honored as far as were concerned
8924343 it is our position that seniority prevails in order of layoff regardless of a column that a person writes or does not write are we going to fight over it i dont know
8924344 i looked at the newspaper this morning and went what the hell it was the most ludicrous thing ive seen in my life
8924345 youve been selling me out there for years and promoting me then you turn on me and you expect people to buy it its crazy

8924355 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8924356 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8924357 i thought she was maybe nervous more than i was
8924358 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8924359 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8924360 i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8924361 like i was just playing on the courts and playing against a girl like it was just a normal match for me
8924362 and then it came back maybe match point and i was like ok now its like the last point and you need to win the last point then the pressure came back
8924363 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8924364 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08

8924368 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8924369 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8924370 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8924371 were ever hopeful even a small development deal over there can be 10m easily that would be very significant to us but the mod doesnt spread that kind of money around to develop new stuff

8924385 our batting has let us down disappointed the way we played we had opportunities but we have not utilised but one day cricket cannot be predicted and is about opportunities overall performance with the bat has been inconsistent
8924386 we want the police to send out the policemen who gave the orders and the police who hurt people

8924419 but he has always behaved impeccably hes a fantastic professional and theres no doubt about it theyve got an outstanding player and we have got to move on
8924420 ich bin emp rt ber diese fatale entscheidung alle aggressiven tendenzen die es im islam gibt wurden ausgeblendet und sch ngeredet hier geht es nicht um die unterst tzung f r eine religion sondern um die st rkung einer bewegung die menschenrechte ignoriert
8924421 eine moschee ist nicht der richtige ort f r integration im gegenteil hier wird weiter ausgegrenzt mit dem k lner bau werden parallelgesellschaften betoniert
8924422 herr schramma sitzt einer utopie auf wenn er ernsthaft glaubt der bau werde bald eine k lsche moschee sein das wird niemals so sein die m chtige moschee mit ihren 55 meter hohen minaretten wird in k ln kaum als zeichen f r verst ndigung verstanden werden sondern als symbol der neuen macht der muslime
8924423 ich klage auch fritz schramma pers nlich an politiker wie er sind mitschuldig wenn es weitere sogenannte ehrenmorde in deutschland gibt und in islamischen familien frauen v llig rechtlos unterdr ckt werden
8924424 die ditib spielt nur diese harmlose rolle es gibt aber auch einen militanten fl gel der gewalt propagiert
8924425 das l uft dann so wenn b rgermeister schramma oder ein andere pers nlichkeit da ist wird deutsch gesprochen wenn man wieder unter sich ist wird auf arabisch persisch oder t rkisch der kampf gegen die ungl ubigen propagiert
8924426 das lehnen wir strikt ab wir werben zwischen der pro islam bewegung und den radikalen gegnern f r einen dritten weg wir wollen eine offene integration von zuwanderern bei der religion privatsache ist und nicht als machtbeweis missbraucht wird

8924468 when certain people throw out ridiculous numbers you know theyre throwing out ridiculous numbers because they want to scare off competition or they want to make themselves seem invincible and that sort of nonsense
8924469 realistically if youre going into this space for the first time and you want to compete with wow and you want to compete with us because were going into that same space youve got to make sure that you have at least 100 million dollars
8924470 in 2001 he had some advice for those wanting to make it in the mmo business
8924471 the reason you need 100 million is that no real first timer has ever succeeded with these games
8924472 and when i mean succeeded no first timer has gone in and said okay i can do this in two or three years and actually do it where it comes out on time and on budget so it is really tough
8924473 when youre competing with wow youre not competing with wow at launch youre competing with wow in 2008 or 2009 with all the additional content
8924474 blizzard president mike morhaime said when youre competing with wow youre not competing with wow at launch
8924475 youre competing with wow in 2008 or 2009 with all the additional content that is absolutely true thats what we did with camelot thats what sony did with everquest and thats what were going to do with warhammer so it will get more and more difficult every year for somebody to come in and compete with whoever the leaders are
8924476 its 100 million if they want to be sure that when they mess up that they have the money to recover
8924477 a lot of start ups fail because they run out of money its not because they dont work hard its like oops it took an extra year or two now what do we do if you look at the history of successful mmos every one of them except for camelot took longer than was expected
8924478 when you have an experienced team with great tech whos done this before how much harder is that for somebody whos never done it
8924479 no but you look at what we did spend it was lot of money
8924480 we are one of the most experienced mmo teams in the industry and we had to delay the game obviously more than once
8924481 and if we had that happen when you have an experienced team with great tech whos done this before how much harder is that for somebody whos never done it no matter how talented the team is theyre going to make mistakes
8924482 i would say we dont have to get anywhere near that number to be considered successful
8924483 would i like us to be number one well of course do we have to be number one to be successful no i want us to be no less than number two that would make me very happy
8924484 lets just say north of half a million would mean were successful now how a far north i wouldnt mind being a little bit cold
8924485 look at us six months out look at us six weeks out if were not adding servers were not doing well
8924486 the corollary to that is if youve seen a game consolidate servers you know its in deep deep trouble thats not a healthy sign for an mmo
8924487 it will be the same for warhammer look at us six months out look at us six weeks out if were not adding servers were not doing well
8924488 activision blizzard its just another company with just another game
8924489 its a big game its a great game thats made a lot of money and made people very happy but its just somebody else to compete with it doesnt phase us well do what we need to do

8924502 el salzburgo est en lo alto de la tabla y la pasada temporada termin con una buena clasificaci n es fuerte en el juego a reo empezamos en casa y hay que dejar saldada la eliminatoria
8924503 el sevilla fc guarda grat simos recuerdos con la visita oficial en 2006 para retirar el primer premio de mejor equipo del mundo es una ciudad preciosa y veremos qu nos depara deportivamente
8924504 todos los sevillistas estamos ilusionados con el plantel con el que contamos para disputar con garant a la temporada la uefa nos dio gloria cach y tenemos un cari o especial por esta copa y la afrontamos con la ilusi n que merece hemos configurado uno de los planteles m s importantes de la historia por las expectativas que hemos generado este verano
8924505 es un equipo duro que explota bien el juego a reo por lo que habr que estar muy atentos en las jugadas a bal n parado
8924506 se es favorito por las prestaciones en el campo no por la camiseta
8924507 nosotros tenemos que pensar en que somos muy fuertes y demostr rselo al rival porque si no vamos al cien por cien podemos pinchar ante cualquiera
8924508 hubiese preferido jugar primero fuera pero trataremos de solventar la eliminatoria en casa aunque donde se culmina siempre es en la vuelta
8924509 es un cl sico del f tbol de su pa s que siempre merodea la zona alta de la tabla
8924510 tiene un entrenador con mucha experiencia y futbolistas muy experimentados es un equipo a respetar sobre todo porque el sevilla va a jugar la vuelta fuera de casa
8924511 lo que toca ahora es recoger toda la informaci n posible para prepararla bien y clasificarnos a la liguilla con la meta de seguir en la competici n
8924512 algo m s largo que otros pero tanto eso como el hecho de que la vuelta se juegue en casa no creo que sean aspectos demasiados relevantes
8924513 therefore you have to draw the line in the sand

8924521 i feel that the move to ulster will be a great opportunity for both me and my family
8924522 its great to be involved in with such a vivid following as ulster
8924523 the move is a great opportunity to see ireland and the united kingdom
8924524 but i want to experience the famous northern ireland culture first hand and im sure well end up venturing across to mainland europe for holidays which we are all excited about
8924525 meeting new people and seeing new places is always exciting and i cant wait to join the rest of the squad and get stuck into some serious training for the new season

8924536 es ist unbestreitbar dass russland ein zuverl ssiger und vertrauensw rdiger energielieferant war ist und bleiben wird insbesondere f r unsere westlichen partner

8924538 we had our first team meeting here at texas this week and i talked about the fact that there are so many things we will be able to implement
8924539 a couple of offensive sets some defensive strategies i learned a lot from our own team from team usa but also from opponents
8924540 the men and the women were so supportive of each other
8924541 they were at every one of our games we went to all of their games except we couldnt go to the gold medal game because we were on the way home you always knew when the men came in to the womens game because there was a roar from the crowd they were rock stars
8924542 it was difficult with the time difference of 13 hours we always had meetings in the morning which is the best time to call recruits because it was the evening in the u s
8924543 there will not be safety in the game whos ever played before
8924544 so how do you know what theyre going to do
8924545 coach royal said if they wont bite as a pup they wont bite as a dog weve got to hope those pups bite out there saturday
8924546 and he said is everybody happy im gone he did wish us good luck and said to tell everyone to stay back
8924547 if you stand at the 10 yard line and look up its straight up
8924548 it was a great night of college football in that setting sometimes i couldnt even hear on the sideline
8924549 i think it will be considerably louder in the stadium
8924550 but it probably protects the north neighborhood better from noise because the north end is higher than it was
8924551 i believe we kind of set the standard i dont feel like we are keeping up
8924552 one time we were playing golf and tom said if you were king for a day what would you do i said fix the stadium this is a 1920s and a 1930s facility then he became a regent and don evans became a regent with hicks evans and cunningham we had the leadership
8924553 we have plans to go to 115 000 but were not active on that at all
8924554 we ought to live where we are for a while to see how it works
8924555 if we keep the program where it is and i think we can and will people will come

8924564 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8924565 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8924566 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8924567 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8924568 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8924569 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have

8924579 the government and hse behaviour with regard to these vital a amp e services at st johns hospital for the people of limerick city is nothing short of disgraceful
8924580 this report was expected to be published as far back as 12 month ago and i have continued to raise this matter in the d il i am now demanding an immediate commitment from them that the current level of a amp e services will be maintained into the future at st johns
8924581 it provides a vital service to the people of limerick and the mid west area in an efficient manner
8924582 apart from ongoing promises that publication of the teamwork horwath group consultants report was imminent no such commitment has been forthcoming which is totally unacceptable
8924583 if you look at the success of the afro caribbean athletes it would be virtually impossible for a white person to win a sprint medal
8924584 we cant change it overnight we are only starting on that path
8924585 instead of a specific government response which is what we need we get the usual lecture on the need to reduce emissions and the need to create green collar jobs
8924586 this kind of generalised speak inspires no confidence after a year in office what we need from minister eamon ryan are specifics as to how the government plans to incentivise a change in consumer habits and a reduction in emissions
8924587 the spin off of such measures such as putting more buses on the roads extending rail links insulating public buildings and planting more trees would be to actually help reduce our carbon emissions
8924588 a box in the programme for government can be ticked off
8924589 unfortunately many other proposals put forward by the greens have been little more than token gestures often placing an unfair burden on low income families
8924590 confirmed that the design phase of the project is progressing well and is on target
8924591 the act places restriction on the availability and visibility of alcohol and provides for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse the introduction of fixed penalty charges for offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct will not only lead to more efficient use of public resources but hopefully will also support more responsible behaviour on the part of those concerned
8924592 a lot of people are worried about the dollar theyre worried about inflation and now we have geopolitical risk with whats happening in russia
8924593 with the tax refund effect on spending now more or less over we think the worst is yet to come for consumers and we expect an outright decline in real third quarter consumption
8924594 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8924595 our ministers are not in the executive to fill seats to make careers or to be administrators their mandate is to bring about lasting and fundamental change that is why sinn fein put them there
8924596 non faccio che pensare a quei giorni ai tuoi sorrisi tutto quello che amo di
8924597 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland

8924600 dr nick goodwin from the kings fund health think tank said the data should be interpreted with caution as it is collected differently in each area he also warned that the data did not take in to account existing health inequalities or the infrastructure in place before different policies were adopted by each government
8924601 mr robinson said he wanted an immediate executive meeting to deal with the issue before it becomes a matter for the courts
8924602 i dont think its involves any deep seated policy differences
8924603 im told of around 150 changes many involve references to northern ireland being changed to the north
8924604 basically once a document is passed by the executive then thats it it should be put out in that form
8924605 ultimately it could go to the courts but i think its more a case of symbolising the bad relations there are at the moment
8924606 i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on

8924609 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
8924610 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
8924611 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8924612 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8924613 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8924614 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8924615 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8924616 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8924617 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8924618 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8924619 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8924620 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8924621 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8924622 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8924623 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8924624 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8924625 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8924626 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8924627 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8924628 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8924629 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8924632 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8924633 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8924634 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8924635 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8924637 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8924638 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent
8924639 the uk population reached 60 5 million this year and the new official figures suggest it will rise to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031

8924743 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8924744 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8924745 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8924746 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8924747 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8924748 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8924749 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8924750 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8924751 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8924752 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

8924756 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
8924757 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
8924758 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
8924759 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
8924760 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
8924761 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
8924762 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce

8924770 earwax is not intrinsically evil stuff and consequently does not have to be removed merely because its present
8924771 in fact it serves a function and so if you dont need to take it out you should just leave it alone
8924772 then there are lots of people wearing earplugs for one reason or another either because theyve got hearing aids or theyre transcriptionists at work or because theyre addicted to their walkman
8924773 and that can increase the likelihood that the wax doesnt come out on its own
8924774 the wax gets much thicker and drier and plus you actually end up with more hair in your ear when youre older and so it traps it
8924775 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8924776 dont put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear
8924777 if theyre going to do something at home they should probably use drops of some sort

8924780 we will introduce today the most lucrative prize on a scratchoff ticket in lottery history

8924782 if i could afford it i probably would but 30 is too much i dont even buy the 5 ones
8924783 its too much and the odds are always against you people rarely buy the 20 tickets

8924856 la verdad que no hicimos la denuncia policial porque no quisimos complicar al club aunque nos dijeron que se va a actuar de oficio la que tendr que intervenir ser la propia liga para castigar a los responsables y sobre todo hacer algo para que esto no se repita

8924859 jai appris ce vendredi matin par les m dias quil tait interdit de consommer des l gumes feuillus des fruits provenant du jardin et de leau de pluie sur les communes de fleurus wanferc e baulet et lambusart
8924860 je ne suis pas particuli rement angoiss e mais je me demande quelles r percussions il y aura sur les animaux de ma ferme si mon b tail est contamin et que je dois faire appel un v t rinaire qui remboursera les frais m dicaux nous navons pratiquement pas dinformations et je trouve tout de m me d plorable davoir t mise au courant seulement lundi alors que lincident sest d roul samedi
8924861 je ne comprends pas pourquoi la situation a volu n gativement entre mercredi et vendredi
8924862 on nous dit que tout va bien et ensuite nous apprenons par les m dias quil ne faut plus consommer des fruits et l gumes du jardin car cela pourrait poser un probl me pour la sant je sais quune cellule de crise a t ouverte la ville mais ils nen savent pas plus que les m dias
8924863 je me demande ce quil se passera quand il y aura un probl me plus grave car en plus les capsules diode donn es la population sont pour la plupart p rim es
8924864 ce type diode est un isotope utilis en m decine depuis plus de 50 ans il nest pas tr s m chant et il en faut des quantit s consid rables pour que les risques soient r els
8924865 je serais tr s tonn que les quantit s lib r es soient telles quelles repr sentent un risque sur la sant
8924866 sil y avait un risque important pour la population lagence f d rale de contr le nucl aire afcn aurait mis en place les mesures existantes savoir la prise de comprim s diode
8924867 il est difficile de d finir les risques puisque nous ne disposons daucune information pr cise sur les taux diode radioactif relev s dans les environs de lire
8924868 pour les petites doses comme celles administr es dans la m decine le risque est quasi nul il faudrait plusieurs dizaines de milli gray mgy pour que la dose soit consid r e comme vraiment risque et imposer la prise des comprim s diode
8924869 les enfants ont une activit thyro dienne intense ce qui fait quils accumulent plus diode galement radio actif
8924870 mais nous sommes tr s certainement dans le cas pr sent dans une gamme de doses qui nest pas dangereuse

8924879 biofuels digest is a great way to keep up on the news i appreciate the ease with which i can pinpoint research topics
8924880 i enjoy reading your newsletter its a very reliable source of information i can always turn to
8924881 your newsletter is great always looking forward to read it thanks for the effort
8924882 your content is excellent and timely i encourage friends from around the world to subscribe
8924883 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
8924884 whenever i hear parents say i hate that music thats the music i go look for
8924885 when hip hop came along i jumped on that because they hated it when psychedelic came along they said they hated that i jumped on that rock n roll started in the 50s when we first started i heard them say that aint real music and thats why i started that and it seems like im back there again with doo wop again
8924886 sample copy doopa loopoly stupid they wanted some funk get some funk in their rap
8924887 they kept funk alive they held onto it until we got back
8924888 in 56 i remember the subway was somewhere right around in here
8924889 had to catch the subway a train up to the apollo theatre its still the same as far as im concerned
8924890 its whole concept is different because originally it was a flashback with a middle aged man playing a young boy trying to break into theater and this is directly the story of a young boy who is trying to break into theater
8924891 anybody in the theater when you start youre just that kid who thinks he has talent possibly and has no idea how to focus it or utilize it and usually its just sort of splattered all over the walls of a theater if you make it that far so ive been there
8924892 i loved the part when i read it the mother and i was excited to get back on the boards in a musical
8924893 we did the workshop last year and we packed the houses they were hanging off the rafter they couldnt get a ticket
8924894 people were stomping and cheering so theyre bringing it back because its fun
8924895 when i come down the street on game days ive noticed that frequently there are cars parked on the sidewalk and also parked next to the fire hydrant on the sidewalk sometimes blocking it on both sides
8924896 if theres a fire with a lot of cars parked by the hydrant like that particularly when theyre parking on both sides it would slow down the firemen
8924897 they block the sidewalk in such a way that you cant even squeeze by at all
8924898 the sidewalks really are for people to walk on and not for parking
8924899 ive asked police ticketing cars in the area to come and take a look at it and theyre really indifferent to it
8924900 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8924901 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8924902 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8924903 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8924904 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8924905 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8924906 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8924907 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8924908 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8924909 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8924910 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity to change course every four years
8924911 this line has the most diverse positive energy and the most hope that i have felt in years and years
8924912 i cannot think of any other period in my life with the exception of the civil rights movement that i felt more proud to be an american
8924913 were not just here today for a ball game were here for a political development for emancipation from ancient fears to remove doubts and to choose hope and that is a big deal it seems to be me
8924914 i do think that on this 54 year journey since the supreme court ruling of brown vs board of education which outlawed segregation barack is running the last lap of the 54 year relay team
8924915 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8924916 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the unites states
8924917 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8924918 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8924919 if you went in to rob and take whatever merchandise he had just take the merchandise
8924920 this man never did anything to anybody all he did was help people in the community
8924921 i am really in disbelief i cannot believe somebody would go up and do something to this man
8924922 now i have no husband my children have no father my grandson is in here crying and looking for his grandfather
8924923 hes not here so they took away a person that meant something for nothing
8924924 he doesnt admit to anything at this point and what remains to be seen is how this case is going to develop
8924925 mexicans keep getting benefits they rob and steal im sorry for what i did i didnt hurt anyone its just property damage
8924926 i dont know the guy i dont know his face how do i know if hes around or if hes not
8924927 it makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable because he doesnt respect us
8924928 i dont use the cane any more i use the walker but tonight i wasnt gonna come up here with a walker only johnny walker
8924929 i played much better when i was younger than now but you notice i still have that swing and i still can play
8924930 i can sit at that piano and play 100 songs
8924931 we are particularly pleased with the rounded site management service which the occ facilitates
8924932 ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
8924933 what this specific death signifies in the scope of the
8924934 franchise according to co star thomas dekker in other words its someone whose death has meaning for the larger skynet terminators storyline and as youve probably heard bad shit happens to john in the first episode and this pushes him towards becoming the mega badass hes meant to be
8924935 she was standing there with her big blue question mark eyes
8924936 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8924937 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8924938 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8924939 independent of who should win i just want the issue to be raised and remembered
8924940 it made perfect sense that there would be a large audience that wouldnt go to a movie theater but would watch the film on the internet particularly younger people so i thought it would be a very good thing to do
8924941 we adjusted our contract and we let him do that
8924942 the projection is that natural gas prices will continue to escalate over the long term the higher natural gas prices rise the more this project will save our customers since the biomass generated power effectively replaces natural gas fueled generation for the utility

8924949 anders kun je er niet meer bij maar het is dan nog wel lekker rustig hoor
8924950 het is goede handel anders stonden we hier niet meer
8924951 we look forward to working with snohomish county public utility district the largest public utility district in washington state and applaud snohomish for taking action to supply its customers with clean renewable wind energy

8924964 jack stole my heart the minute i saw his sad brown eyes whenever he would come out of his kennel to go outside he would come and sit in front of me with his head down to be petted he would follow me around the courtyard and would accompany me as i worked in the boarding area
8924965 since jack was too sick to be sent to maine with his sister and the other shelter dogs i decided that if i could find an apartment that allowed dogs i would adopt him as luck would have it i found a beautiful house where jack would be welcome and on the very day that the other foster dogs were put on the transport truck headed to maine i adopted him
8924966 jack is now two years old and recently had his annual exam for his vaccinations he still sees the veterinarian who saved him when he was so sick and she gave him a clean bill of health he is heartworm free and has no lasting damage to his heart i am thrilled that our time together will be much longer than anyone originally thought
8924967 i truly believe that anything and everything is possible if we work together to help effect change on august 31 we will bring together individuals from all walks of life to come together to help as one and end human suffering will you be among us

8924972 have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer even as the rest of the apostles and the brethren of the lord and cephas
8924973 a majority of scholars think that supernatural powers are intended here
8924974 there are good reasons to think that it has come from a later hand
8924975 continued conservatism in it spending in the u s which has extended into western europe and several countries in asia
8924976 i worry that the problems in housing and credit are more significant and longer lasting than the usual market adjusting events
8924977 make the elderly finally feel embraced instead of ridiculed and remove the teasing from the adolescent equation that affects so many children in a negative way
8924978 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8924979 we have agreed that he can come over and train with us
8924980 it may be the start of something that moves him elsewhere or it may be that we get something going here at the moment its simply a training session for ronnie and ourselves
8924981 hes been on his travels since then but from a familiarity point of view he knows what its like up here
8924982 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8924983 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8924984 vp rumor roundup snl may need a lot of tina fey guest shots
8924985 jimmy carter whines that mccain talks too much about vietnam
8924986 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8924987 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8924988 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8924989 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8924990 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8924991 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8924992 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8924993 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8924994 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8924995 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8924996 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8924997 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8924998 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8924999 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8925000 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8925001 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8925002 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8925003 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8925004 who are open to doing something on the production side
8925005 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8925006 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8925007 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8925008 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8925009 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8925010 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8925011 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8925012 depois de 4 meses usando o eee 4gb eu j estava cansado do sistema operacional que veio instalado o xandros foi ent o o momento de decidir migrar para outra op o e como j utilizo o ubuntu 8 04 no meu desktop a escolha foi f cil vamos ver neste artigo todos os passos necess rios para instalar e configurar o famoso ubuntu 8 04 no seu eee pc
8925013 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8925014 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8925015 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8925016 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8925017 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8925018 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8925019 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8925020 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8925021 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8925022 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8925023 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8925024 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8925025 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8925026 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8925027 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8925028 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8925029 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8925030 eu estava um pouco nervosa quando entrei na quadra porque nunca havia visto minha oponente antes e ela atuou de maneira completamente diferente ao que eu imaginava sacando muito bem e distribuindo golpes potentes
8925031 i held you in my hand wanderer and you were so beautiful
8925032 la gente pensa che la vita sia una strada dritta ma sbaglia la vita un circolo un maledetto cerchio che gira in tondo alla fine ti ritrovi in mano esattamente quello che avevi allinizio e finisci per tornare al luogo da cui sei venuto
8925033 mi rimasto cos poco a cui aggrapparmi e non voglio che mi venga tolto

8925037 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8925038 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8925039 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8925040 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8925041 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8925042 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8925043 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8925044 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8925045 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8925054 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8925055 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8925056 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8925057 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8925073 this recall is being initiated as these sandwiches contain some of the ready to eat deli meat products recalled by maple leaf consumer foods there have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these sandwiches
8925074 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8925075 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8925076 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8925077 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8925092 all the great fighters have won olympic gold medals before going on to win world titles as professionals
8925093 i was all set to turn pro but when the games started and i saw that they are already making a big thing out of london 2012 i started having second thoughts
8925094 when i first started boxing i dreamed only of winning professional world titles but after a while boxing as an amateur you start to think about an olympic medal
8925095 when that didnt happen this time i was ready to turn pro again but watching the boxing from beijing on telly i reckon i would beat every one of them in four years
8925096 you can throw the form book out of the window in any major final and that applies in every sporting contest not just a game of rugby league
8925097 on the day anything can happen and in every two horse race theres every chance that one of the horses will fall hull must run out at wembley believing that and believing they can pull off what would be a major surprise
8925098 we have all seen major shocks in the past and in 2005 hull themselves managed to turn leeds over and lift the cup
8925099 everyone will want to win and whatever happens there will be 17 disappointed players come saturday night but i look forward to the game and am very much a neutral hoping to sit back soak up the atmosphere and see a terrific contest
8925100 im a great supporter of the cup its a marvellous competition its an event steeped in tradition and everybody wants to either play at wembley or coach there
8925101 being fortunate enough to win at wembley is the kind of thing you dream of it provides fantastic memories but you need that bit of luck and the cup final is always a special occasion for all concerned
8925102 if saints are allowed to play to near full potential they will win but hull also have the ability to score a lot of points
8925103 saints do however have a big advantage in defence they are strong determined and their players have bags of experience of this kind of situation from playing in so many big matches
8925104 i believe its a restraint of trade not to have allowed this kind of thing to happen until this season all referees have a very strong professional integrity

8925134 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8925135 i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8925136 washington has been talking about oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8925137 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day senator mccain took office
8925138 since canada is our 1 supplier us election obama shares a vision and plan to fulfill americas promise
8925139 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8925140 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8925141 under any scenario were going to see more nuclear power because its just going to be more cost effective once theres a price on carbon
8925142 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course
8925143 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that

8925224 with a real possibility of getting an impact in louisiana
8925225 so were talking about a very serious storm and one that should be hitting the area perhaps monday into tuesday
8925226 three years later the same thing may happen its a little discouraging
8925227 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8925228 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8925229 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8925230 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8925231 the reality is that we must work together to solve global problems
8925232 we rely on the objectiveness of eu leaders and count on continuation of our cooperation beneficial for people of both russia and the european union
8925233 in the past few years nato has more than once violated the u n charter and international law that is why it has no moral right to claim the role of mentor in international relations and assess the actions of other states
8925234 we are doing everything we can so druzhba can keep working stably and supply european consumers with enough oil
8925235 we have worked for many years to gain not just the image but the status of a reliable energy supplier to europe and we would never let it suffer even in this political situation
8925236 lukoil is delivering the same amount of oil and oil products to western europe as before
8925237 gazprom is going to make 60 billion this year from exporting gas to europe its highly unlikely that on some kind of whim it would suddenly decide that it didnt want to do that
8925238 that a cutoff of european supplies is someones stupid insinuation
8925239 there is no point in that kind of sanctions the west gets russian oil by sea one way or another
8925240 and what would russia do with the oil put it back in the ground and what about the fact that oil sales form the base of its currency inflows there were buyers for russian oil even at the height of the cold war
8925241 only a sick mind would think of cutting off europe
8925242 technically it is practically impossible since russian refineries are running at maximum rates and it is difficult to arbitrage right now
8925243 i thought he showed a lot of poise at the end of the half that was a real solid drive
8925244 its a slow process moving to a new position youre going to hit a few bumps but im getting better
8925245 it was hard and im still weak but im making great progress
8925246 i have to take things one day at a time
8925247 i cant wait to get back to see my guys

8925252 hilarious claws out look at the often brutal relationship between performers and their most vocal critics
8925253 to make a compelling case for oil priced well below 100 the nigerian situation with sporadic rebel attacks on oil facilities shuttering production has to be resolved as well as the standoff with iran over its nuclear program
8925254 we have established that all types of antipsychotics carry an increased risk although the risk might be somewhat higher with the atypical drugs
8925255 we reaffirm that the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided wherever possible
8925256 although their objectives are similar the candidates take very different routes to reach them
8925257 the obama platform leans more heavily on public sector institutions and regulatory requirements whereas the mccain platform prefers tax incentives and other strategies to promote free market activity and encourage individual responsibility
8925258 if employers are not the primary source for medical coverage will they still be inclined to promote health and wellness in the workplace if not would the government fill the void
8925259 does an employer pay or play mandate as advocated by obama make it more difficult for u s companies to compete globally is coverage expansion through mandates worth the potential cost to the u s economy
8925260 all repairs like this need software they have to order

8925266 people tend to forget that software is not a service the whole cloud scheme is a scam to lock users into a single product and somehow extract more money from them
8925267 the same problem has appeared when using a different screen saver from the ones apple provides on the computer
8925268 ive been a mac user since and ive owned macs
8925269 an issue they are gathering information on and investigating possible fixes for

8925278 here we are 10 years after with a compact that will allow diversion of water it significantly limits pipelines and tanker trucks and freighters full of water but theyre allowed to leave the great lakes with containers full of water
8925279 establishes a precedent that water can be grabbed by profit hungry corporations who want to claim it is a product not subject to the compact this undermines the very purpose of the compact and creates a dangerous precedent for exporting water in the u s in this instance from the largest body of freshwater in north america

8925285 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
8925286 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
8925287 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing
8925288 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees
8925289 i think his followers have a different sexual preference than most men
8925290 im not qualified to write for online media let alone mainstream media

8925292 nbc news is confirming sarah palin is at a state fair in alaska
8925293 reporters have been lied to in the last 24 hours believing it was pawlenty
8925294 the adults 18 49 demographic remains the gold standard among advertisers yet tv auds keep getting greyer according to nielsens 2008 09 national universe estimates the 55 plus age bracket is by far the fastest growing tv audience demo accelerating at twice the rate of the overall tv audience the ratings company estimates that 71 4 million tv viewers are over age 55 up 2 7 from last year in comparison total viewers over the age of 2 number 290 million up 1 3 from last year
8925295 for most of the convention cnn staid stable and anchored by fewer egomaniacs won higher ratings than the other cable news channels as well as abc and cbs and wednesday cnn was neck and neck with nbc and for a while even ahead suggesting that when a political event is this interesting television commentators are less so
8925296 the cable networks stooped to occasionally questionable tactics and anchors had near violent arguments on camera
8925297 i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8925298 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8925299 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8925300 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8925301 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8925302 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8925303 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8925304 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8925305 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8925306 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8925307 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8925308 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8925309 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8925310 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8925311 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8925312 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8925313 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8925314 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8925315 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8925316 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8925317 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8925318 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8925319 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8925320 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8925321 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8925322 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8925323 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8925324 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8925325 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8925326 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8925327 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8925328 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8925329 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8925330 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8925331 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8925332 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8925333 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8925334 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8925335 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8925336 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8925337 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8925338 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8925339 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8925340 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8925341 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8925342 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8925343 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8925344 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8925345 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8925346 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8925347 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8925348 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8925349 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8925350 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8925351 no one works for someone we all just work together
8925352 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8925353 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8925354 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8925355 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8925356 temos cerca de 500 mil acidentes no ambiente de trabalho por ano preciso investir
8925357 estamos o brasil no nono lugar nossa meta baixar para 200 mil em cinco anos
8925358 a previd ncia gasta r 10 bilh es por ano com acidentes do trabalho que afastam o empregado por mais de 15 dias quanto mais se estimula o investimento menos acidentes e menos gastos
8925359 entendo que os crimes cometidos por autoridades durante o regime militar foram crimes de lesa humanidade e por isso n o prescrevem nunca
8925360 um absurdo falar em anistia para os dois lados quando a lei foi aprovada em 1979 os militares falavam que a lei nem se aplicava a eles pois n o tinham cometido crimes tanto o governo reconhece que isso ocorreu que tem indenizado as v timas agora n o d para achar que pessoas foram mortas e torturadas e ningu m foi respons vel
8925361 crimes cometidos por agentes do estado durante o regime como homic dio estupro oculta o de cad ver e forma o de quadrilha n o prescrevem
8925362 falar em puni o dos torturadores nada tem a ver com revanchismo pretendemos que sejam processados segundo as regras constitucionais com plenitude do direito de defesa que sejam identificados e que reconhecida a culpa sejam condenados
8925363 ele o t pico homem de rea uma figura de que o gr mio est precisando j que contamos apenas com o marcel com essa caracter stica o morales alto forte e excelente cabeceador esperamos que venha mas isso ainda n o certo

8925374 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8925375 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8925376 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8925377 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8925378 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8925379 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8925380 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8925381 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8925382 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8925383 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8925384 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8925385 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8925386 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8925387 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8925388 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8925389 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8925390 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8925391 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8925392 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8925393 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8925394 youre in the records room can i get you anything
8925395 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8925396 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8925397 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8925398 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8925399 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8925400 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8925401 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8925402 fiquei muito feliz por tudo ter dado certo quero agradecer aos dirigentes do panathinaikos que sempre foram muito profissionais e muito leais comigo por terem me liberado deixo muitos amigos em atenas e parto para uma nova experi ncia o d namo de moscou uma equipe forte a liga russa est crescendo muito e estou muito motivado
8925403 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8925404 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8925405 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8925406 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8925407 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8925408 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8925409 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8925410 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8925411 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8925412 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8925413 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8925414 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8925415 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8925416 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8925417 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8925418 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8925419 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8925420 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8925421 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8925422 with the tax refund effect on spending now more or less over we think the worst is yet to come for consumers
8925423 jai gard le silence trop longtemps elle se sert de ma fille les gens navaient jamais entendu parler de samantha ronson avant quelle ne rencontre lindsay elle n tait quune dj de los angeles et maintenant elle crit un livre elle fait du mal lindsay
8925424 you got an issue i got a problem with that
8925425 both sides should start to discuss to plant border markers from undisputed border areas to the complicated border areas and some complicated border areas will be built with border markers or concrete walls
8925426 cambodia will allow private companies to invest at least 2 million dollars at the preah vihear temple to set up cable cars for tourists
8925427 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8925428 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us
8925429 according to the 2001 land law the lake itself should be inalienable state land so its ownership cannot be transferred for longer than 15 years during which time the function of the property must not change
8925430 many of the families have strong legal claims to the land under the land law
8925431 we are very concerned what will happen to our houses and livelihoods and the possibility that we will have to move
8925432 we ask the company to halt the process of filling in the lake and meet the community to discuss the issue
8925433 i think i speak for all families when i say the boeung kak lake area is very easy to live in
8925434 even poor people can make a living catching snails in the lake the water is polluted but this is being used as an excuse to force people out in the name of development
8925435 i want to stress the compensation offer is not acceptable to the people
8925436 if the government wishes to develop boeung kak they should do so through a legal process with the participation of communities that live around the lake
8925437 there is an expectation that a lot more evictions will happen and that evictions in the works for some time will now get the green light
8925438 we are concerned that a number of evictions could be carried out after the election and we call on the government to respect the laws of cambodia and their international human rights obligations
8925439 there is no doubt that boeung kak and other evictions in cambodia will be on the agenda he said
8925440 the largest known populations for both species in the world
8925441 dari pagi penjualan tiket sudah lumayan kita seneng banget ngeliat antusias mereka
8925442 rumah ini milik abdul qodir jaelani tidak ada satu iblis pun boleh merampas

8925444 ini sebuah kesempatan buat saya untuk makin bersyukur lagi dan menjadi terbaik lagi
8925445 approximately 12 million people a year in the u s seek medical care for impacted or excessive cerumen
8925446 this leads to nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures by health care professionals developing practical clinical guidelines for physicians to understand the harm vs benefit profile of the intervention was essential
8925447 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears
8925448 this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8925449 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and ongoing including infections and hearing loss
8925450 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
8925451 we need to monitor all our personnel related costs to make sure we are managing our resources well
8925452 at the same time overtime in many cases is required to ensure the continuity of our service to the public such as dealing with hospital or safety emergencies or other situations where it makes more sense economically to pay someone overtime than to hire additional permanent staff
8925453 in the long run it would be more economically sound not to have that overtime bump
8925454 overtime should be an exception it should not be the rule
8925455 i thought at first the noise could be coming from some old bearings in the foyers hydro station across the loch
8925456 but when i went out of the house i couldnt hear anything at all
8925457 i have to confess its bizarre it gets into your head and is like a buzzing sound vibrating like an empty football i think its a resonance frequency putting your fingers in ears doesnt help ive heard it start at 2am and it would carry on until 8am my mother has heard it too
8925458 its a complete mystery because you only seem to hear it from indoors and its exactly the same as what is being experienced in suffolk
8925459 if someone had said to me a spacecraft had landed on the meadows i would have said well i heard it
8925460 we have had reports of a low humming noise which is loud enough to wake local residents
8925461 we will investigate this but it will be very much a process of elimination to try and identify a noise source
8925462 that can involve switching off all power sources to the property to ensure there is not a problem with a motor in the house

8925466 relying on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a settlement of local conflicts
8925467 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8925468 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our servicemen
8925469 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present
8925470 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership and if this is so then it means that american citizens are in the combat zone performing their duties and they can only do that following a direct order from their leader and not on their own initiative
8925471 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8925472 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8925473 what was the gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8925474 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8925475 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the sides and push it into the murder of the other side and its over it seemed like an easy solution the thing is it turns out that its not always so
8925476 backlash against the industry wide death rattles he seems fond of publishing
8925477 the news business is collapsing around us mostly because people like romenesko sit around wringing their hands and lamenting what was instead of innovating the way we do our jobs and the products we create

8925495 if we do see the storm develop into a hurricane 85 of the gulfs oil and natural gas production could be shut we could see over 1 million barrels of oil production disrupted and by monday we could witness an oil spike towards 130 a barrel
8925496 while the destructive potential of gustav cannot be ignored the current state of demand destruction makes it more difficult than in previous years to adequately price a premium for that potential
8925497 oil assets have had some improvements over the last three years to make them less hurricane sensitive but the main difference is that u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when hurricane katrina struck in 2005
8925498 it certainly doesnt seem to be in russias best interests as it would
8925499 russia takes any slight seriously and is not above petty measures to retaliate and express its displeasure
8925500 we did away with the static html site and said heres the wiki

8925508 the boards most important responsibility is to protect software freedom and to decide the fsfs goals and tactics that means that they are ultimately responsible for the gnu general public license the lgpl agpl and gnu free documentation license for fsf copyright assigned software and manuals and for much of the infrastructure of running the gnu project as a result board members must first and foremost be committed to the cause of software freedom

8925511 we have a growing membership and we have a view of what we want the membership to be our membership program provides the bulk of our funding but we also want a deeper engagement with out members in the sense that we want them to be activists and we want to be able to provide them with the resources necessary for them to be more effective in this role
8925512 not just out reach out to our members and tell them what were doing but because we get a lot of good ideas from them
8925513 i tend to have close relationships with the campaigns team the licensing expert and the new membership coordinator and have at least weekly conversations with those staff members on particular issues and projects
8925514 we have to work carefully with support from the community and from a very small financial base
8925515 we also have to make sure that we remain coherent with what were doing weve got some chief things wed like to accomplish in the next couple of years but were taking small steps toward them

8925552 only when you live outside south africa do you realize what you leave behind working abroad gives you a different perspective
8925553 i see so many positives in where south africa is today and the achievements that have been made from when i left it behind eight years ago i want to face the issues here and be part of the solution

8925562 it could have been georgia or something else but some kind of last straw was waiting to come along
8925563 we cannot base our actions on the opinion of a state whose budget falls within the statistical error of the u s budget
8925564 there is a feeling that the west treats russia merely as a loser in the cold war which has to play by the winners rules
8925565 the nuba mountains region is a microcosm of the tensions surrounding cpa implementation many local residents feel ignored with good reason by the international community and neglected by the un system
8925566 growing ethnic insecurity in the region has the potential to deteriorate significantly over the coming months and needs urgent attention to prevent it from spiralling out of control
8925567 with the sole exception of abyei kordofan suffers an attention deficit
8925568 the dangers of renewed violent conflict and humanitarian crisis in kordofan have been evident ever since the signing of the cpa
8925569 rather than socio economic integration and political reconciliation lubricated by a development efforts and a peace dividend south kordofan is the locus of an armed standoff with many fearing a return to war
8925570 the potential for armed group activity is fuelled by the large numbers of ex combatants the near absence of a comprehensive reintegration programme since organised hostilities ended in 2005
8925571 without the required co location in training centres the former enemies have separate chains of command training armaments and barracks administration of government and splm controlled areas remains separate two local government systems currently operate in parallel with separate policies for education two languages two systems judicial and security systems and local government structures passing from one area to the other involves passing through armed checkpoints
8925572 if you look at the new developments in the area there is a very big gap between what the report is saying and what is also taking place
8925573 i dont think the reports findings have become invalid but there has been a very big breakthrough in terms of integration of separate administrations and police forces
8925574 i would be the last person to say there are no problems in south kordofan that would be nonsense
8925575 but i think this is a huge step forward and i am amazed that there is hardly any attention for this fact i dont think war will be as inevitable as people have been saying
8925576 unmis has done little to calm tensions in contrast to the active efforts of the much smaller number of unarmed ceasefire monitors the joint military commission jmc which were present from 2002 05 military observers in the un mission in sudan unmis peacekeeping force are insufficiently resourced and supported there are no permanent un civil affairs and human rights officers and international ngos and other independent observers are few
8925577 i dont think that unmis has been weak or has failed in implementing its part of ddr
8925578 there are a lot of preparatory things we had to have in place before we could start
8925579 it would have been a disaster all these prerequisites have now been met and that is why we are moving towards a pilot project
8925580 a combination of weak political will an international community distracted by darfur and unmiss underperformance has led to the failure of cpa implementation in south kordofan many now view war in the nuba mountains as inevitable
8925581 my father disappeared and my mother found his body in the morgue they dumped my brothers body in the river
8925582 my husband took me to see some of his relatives id not seen before i stayed the night then in the morning they brought me breakfast with apricot juice it tasted funny so i asked what was in it they told me nothing just drink
8925583 if we meet in the next life will you choose me or another man
8925584 i never intended to blow myself up when stopped at the checkpoint i wanted to turn myself in but i was afraid

8925598 i think we need to get the uefa strategic committee to look at the whole idea
8925599 i think that it is wrong that a player can play for two clubs in any competition scoring a goal for one team one week and then scoring against them a few weeks later
8925600 i also think we have to look at both the summer and winter transfer windows
8925601 the season starts in many countries in july or early in august yet the transfer window does not close until the end of august
8925602 there are those who stay at home and those who go away and it has always been so everyone can choose for himself but he must choose while there is still time and never change his mind
8925603 he can throw the ball to jarrett and hes a go getter hes a playmaker
8925604 were going to have to stop him from breaking our defensive line and scrambling on us were going to battle all game and im going to give dillard all i got im going to make sure nothing is easy for him and that he has to work for everything he gets

8925606 we are extremely excited to bring this unique show to the cotai strip as our first permanent step in china
8925607 the creative challenge is very interesting for us as this area has yet to be developed for its entertainment offers thanks to our partnership with las vegas sands we are anxious for asian audiences to discover this cirque du soleil production
8925608 we are both proud and delighted to be partnering with cirque du soleil and bringing this internationally acclaimed production to macau and to its first ever permanent base in asia
8925609 cirque du soleil will surely give the people of this region a chance to experience wholly unique and world class entertainment an aim to which we are also committed
8925610 its a wretched contract and we refused to sign it
8925611 we gave our dna and that of our children to help develop testing and prenatal diagnosis we sent our blood and skin samples to a doctor at miami childrens hospital
8925612 is it right that they use our genes given to help others in a way that restricts access and increases cost to testing
8925613 my understanding from the hospital was we needed to file the patent just so i could work with the gene myself
8925614 i had nothing to do with their licensing decision and i got no penny from any patent
8925615 this is my medical practice i cant do what i was trained to do and i spent a long time training to do it
8925616 that your standard would allow patent protection for roughly 40 percent of human genes and yet if you ask any working scientist what percent of human genes they know the function of youd get maybe 2 percent
8925617 not just the incytes of the world zillions of universities are taking the same approach
8925618 i dont doubt it for a second but it doesnt make me feel any different
8925619 when theres a gold rush a lot of people go to california
8925620 the idea of patenting dna sequences is abhorrent to me but in particular the way its being done now is intellectually dishonest
8925621 are being done on the backs and shoulders of research funded by the public and charitable foundations it doesnt seem right that these sequences should be taken and locked up for the purpose of profit making
8925622 we dont care how you find out something new only that youre the first to find it
8925623 medical research is increasingly a matter of using technologies to gather a bunch of pieces of information
8925624 its really accelerating things and thats what matters and when people make discoveries like that they deserve both public accolades and rewards
8925625 andreas was my child and i loved him dearly he was loved and cared for superbly well but he still had a difficult life especially toward the end would i have wanted him to be born i cant answer that but im working very hard for screening so that families have all the options and one option is an abortion the key thing you need is information education and the availability of testing
8925626 it will make it harder for people to develop cures for these diseases

8925639 i also wanted to be the flash too cause i move slow
8925640 i would be batman for sure if such feats were possible in the real world as far as who i most resemble well if youre going on a physical level once i shaved my head i relegated myself to professor x jonn jonzz territory and thats a lot of green body paint id need if you mean in terms of personality who do you most resemble thats harder to say im sort of a batman superman mix with a bit of captain america thrown in i think i dunno i could be totally wrong actually truth be told if i woke up with powers tomorrow id pick superman that would allow me to do the most good i would want to dress up like superman to inspire but i dont know if the world is ready for shaved head superman so i might take supermans powers and put on a batman suit that way you have the best of both worlds
8925641 if the question is who would i choose to be of any and all superheroes i probably wouldnt say hawkeye because theres too much invulnerability to be had out there to pick a dude whos just a guy but ill get back to him dont worry if i could pick someone to be thats incredibly hard because the best characters to read would be the ones you dont want to be because they are conflicted or set upon that knocks out superman black bolt etc theyre too messed up and itd be easier to just have no powers than all the responsibility that comes with those powers my instinct is to say green lantern because he can do whatever he thinks of and the ring protects him from damage plus the ladies seem to dig him i think given the choice id go for kyle rather than hal because he doesnt have that whole genocide thing in his past plus hes an imaginative artist this entire answer could change tomorrow because everyone i think of has some horrible shit as baggage it really is easier to just be a dude than to be some superhero
8925642 who do i resemble id say at that point i could go back to hawkeye hes funny and talented but completely mortal he always seemed to be trying to prove himself and at times he tried a little harder than he possibly should have but ultimately hes one of the great heroes specifically because of that lack of power i love that either him or someone like iceman again a guy who cracks jokes but is no small force in the x men his power might be looked at as insignificant at first but really he has control over water and whats the most abundant thing in our world i havent really read all that much iceman but thats the feeling i get
8925643 maybe its just me but after careful consideration i feel that any adult who gives any answer to this question other than jamie madrox the multiple man is not thinking things through
8925644 one of my dupes will study how to make a jetpack
8925645 the short answer is superman and the sentry a while back i did a piece on the sentry and i mentioned that his insecurity might be a major factor in why comic readers dislike him so much theres that old cliche that we notice our own flaws reflected in others and not that it applies to all readers but i think most people can relate to the fear that maybe theyre being too lazy or maybe theyre not as strong as they could be and since super heroes are these icons of action and courage to see a caped hero being passive and cowardly makes us mad we say that its not what we signed up for but what if our distaste for the character comes from relating to his insecurity his sense of overwhelming doubt his inaction hes all our fears magnified id like to be superman because i want to be more selfless in spite of everything his first concern is the welfare of others he has fears but he faces them head on but i fear that im more like the sentry because i doubt myself thats who im afraid of being
8925646 daredevil but not blind but thats a cop out i know how about iron fist i dont really want crazy powers i just want to have more awesome regular stuff
8925647 no idea but maybe spider man i try to be earnest and honestly good like him and succeed with varying degrees of success
8925648 imagine your back is made of gills and let the air slide over them cant you just does your life need balance
8925649 we who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves each of us should please his neighbor for his good to build him up for even christ did not please himself may the god who gives you endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow christ jesus

8925742 thats been my number one challenge finding the right space to locate it thats near enough to downtown and far enough from residential areas
8925743 we have about 10 sites including the n main terrace as options that the staff and the committee have examined as alternative sites
8925744 we were really just looking to location and proximity to other uses particularly proximity to neighborhoods and other social services each of us is sort of im sure trying to figure out which of the sites we like
8925745 i dont know if theyre going to consider us or not
8925746 basically were already providing the services on a daily basis
8925747 my big thing is if we would have had the money that the city spent on an empty warehouse then we could have shown progress
8925748 were providing these services day in and day out and we cant continue to do that without funding
8925749 we own the property behind us we own the property next door to us so theres room for expansion
8925750 evidently st francis house is in pretty bad financial trouble so any resources the city could put into it would help it survive
8925751 i think we have heard quite a bit from other interests in the downtown that it hasnt been at all positive to have st francis there it has been very helpful to a lot of people not only to homeless but also to poor people who are very hungry
8925752 the biggest reason that we chose to move the fleet maintenance garage away from the stephen foster neighborhood was noise
8925753 there are a lot of ways that we could deal with that if we did decide on a joint location we would make sure that we lived up to a good standard of neighborliness

8925758 frankie decided he needed to raise money totally aside from what other foundations raise for research to find a cure for als
8925759 what is forgotten what gets left behind is funds to assist patients with daily living
8925760 first he lost use of his legs then his arms and then his back and neck so he lost the ability to be mobile
8925761 then he lost ability to eat so he had to have an eating tube his voice was very limited when he died
8925762 that is the reason why they call it the cruelest disease you are still as vital mentally as if you were healthy but you totally lose use of your body
8925763 there is a tremendous need for equipment with als patients which is a not covered by insurance
8925764 it bothered him that insurance didnt pay for so many things that really kept the dignity in peoples lives some people are unable to get out of bed or out of house because couldnt afford to
8925765 case workers work with patients across the state on a financial need basis
8925766 they use our funds they can draw funds to have ramps built to install chair lifts handicap bathrooms handicap toilets

8925780 im talking about a slap on the face and that you could do much much worse damage to a woman or a man by totally demoralizing them by taking away their whole identity
8925781 psychologists found memories of painful emotional experiences linger far longer than those involving physical pain
8925782 there is something very intangible about emotional damage with physical pain you can see the bruise but in emotional abuse there is often fear and anxiety which remains
8925783 youve got to be a little on the aggressive side work is hard to find now in gainesville
8925784 some people think that there are no jobs here there are many jobs in gainesville
8925785 a lot of places right now are looking for experience theres not a lot of entry level being advertised
8925786 it doesnt mean just looking for the job with the most money you look at fellow employees and benefits
8925787 you can get a high paying job but if that company doesnt offer good benefits that money is going to go to health care or whatever your family needs look at the total company

8925805 we know that saakashvili has not distinguished himself recently by the appropriateness of his analysis and actions and we would not like to think that he was given some order from washington we would like to hope that possibly we were talking about some sort of incorrect interpretation on the part of the president of georgia of any signals that could have been sent from washington

8925821 some corals around the island have been damaged due to careless snorkelling and by divers as well as litterbugs and the weather
8925822 the reef we hope can restore the damage and at the same time encourage new growth around the island not only for our tourism industry but also because it is part of our natural heritage
8925823 its also a great place for fish to aggregate which would be a plus point for divers
8925824 all the artists on minus came to the label through different paths
8925825 the funny thing is all of the guys in the family grew up through the early plus 8 and plastikman parties
8925826 the whole team attended these early plastikman hawtin parties and became inspired to get deeper into music
8925827 between all of us now its like there is this feedback loop between being inspired and inspiring
8925828 magda came into the scene through the early parties in detroit
8925829 i remember seeing her dj and feeling her amazing presence behind the decks
8925830 artists need a tangible unique quality a personality and magda had it right at the beginning of her career even when she was playing in the early days
8925831 troy started out as a photographer and hes always been a creative guy
8925832 hes a risk taker and enjoys taking a chance but hes also got this dark edge to him that reminds me of the early plastikman records
8925833 that dark side can be heard in all of his productions as well as during his dj sets
8925834 jesse was friends with magda and her posse and while we were all living in nyc together he started passing me demos
8925835 i remember hearing his music and being blown away all his tracks were off kilter and always had some sort of quirky hook to them
8925836 jesse is a funny quirky guy and his music is the same
8925837 theres always something tongue in cheek about his tracks making you not sure if hes serious or not

8925865 while conditions in the financial sector have been challenging we believe bankatlantic bancorps stock price has been unfairly depressed largely due to misinformation provided to the market
8925866 as detailed in bankatlantic bancorps second quarter 2008 press release issued on july 29 2008 bankatlantic has made material progress in improving core operating earnings reporting a 37 improvement in pre tax core operating earnings defined as pre tax earnings before the impact of loan loss provisions impairment restructuring and exit activities versus the first quarter of 2008

8925879 as i listened to other people discuss their fears and dreams i found myself saying i would like to spend a month in tuscany
8925880 i fear the loss of stimulation that comes with work it gives me meaning and structure
8925881 there would be a loss of friends and even my plumber
8925882 if you want to know what somebody values ask them how they spend their time
8925883 kyle garst and dane devlin have been an important part of this organization for many years
8925884 they have decided against moving to phillipsburg and will instead pursue other investment and professional opportunities we appreciate their contributions and wish them the best of luck
8925885 my long time business associate mike hess assisted aleritas capital during the last several months and helped the company make significant progress in a very difficult credit environment i have asked mike to assume the duties of president of the franchise insurance agency a position he previously held for many years because the health of the insurance agency franchise is important to the quality of aleritas loan portfolio

8925919 it will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so incoherent that they cannot be understood if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated or undergo such incessant changes that no man who knows what the law is today can guess what it will be tomorrow
8925920 our philosophy from the start has been to nurture that support and also to believe in ourselves
8925921 jesse and i have been playing in bands together since we were kids so even though we all have different influences there is a trust level when it comes to adding elements to the music that brings it all together
8925922 its true about canada growing up youre either playing in a band or playing hockey we knew we werent fodder for the nhl so here we are
8925923 the return was accidental in a way i had gone to one of their shows but just as a fan next thing i know jesse calls me up and asked me to come into the studio with them but i was itching to go there was one particular song i knew i just had to sing even practiced it in my dads office before i went in to the studio and gave it a try
8925924 we just liked her spirit and how well we all seem to click from the start
8925925 we have always enjoyed working as one creating something out of nothing
8925926 we write about real things that happen to us were family and friends but we are also survivors so we know what stories to tell
8925927 bands write record tour and all of that but once that whole thing is done well all sit down and write again we always have notepads kicking around and were always writing down ideas so the juices are always flowing
8925928 we scraped together whatever we could through friends and family to fund the album ourselves
8925929 jeff and mike were both able to capture the raw enthusiasm we have for this music
8925930 you can break that song down and see it very clearly it means a lot to all of us the story behind it as well as the overall feeling our fans seem to take away from that one
8925931 its funny but thats one of the last songs we wrote for the album
8925932 it was one of those things that was just a fun ride from start to finish
8925933 we definitely went from an immature heavy rock band to finding our comfort zone with the more pop rock melodic music that we have today on this record
8925934 weve begged borrowed and pleaded with everybody we know its not cheap to make a record with the professionals were using and the studios we went in
8925935 working with jeff was great because he has a bit of a different background that was a little more pop oriented and we were one of the first bands that was a little heavier that he had worked with
8925936 so he brought a bit of a different element in and things that we normally wouldnt have thought of as far as little production things on the record
8925937 once we do the full cross canada tour it will start opening a lot of doors
8925938 the more successful we become the more accepting our peers are
8925939 it starts off with a tongue in cheek reference in the hook line if i had more money honey would you love me love me love me
8925940 but its a relationship song looking at it from an outside opinion
8925941 everybody always thinks that if you have more its going to make everything better in reality its not going to make a difference
8925942 the music packs as much punch as ever and more variety as staind sometimes departs from its rock metal power ballads for tunes that suggest pink floyd and even brit band oasis
8925943 a few engaging surprises including the sparse acoustic tangled up in you politically charged rainy day parade and the corner with a gospel choir and a bluesy grandeur worthy of pink floyd

8925956 el consejo debe transformarse de un rgano seleccionador a un rgano formador no s lo de sus aspirantes sino que tambi n mediante acuerdos de capacitaci n permanente con el superior tribunal de justicia de quienes ejercen los cargos de magistrados y funcionarios y de los empleados judiciales para esto no es necesaria una modificaci n legislativa sino un cambio de actitud

8925958 como abogados debemos analizar y seleccionar los jueces con criterio no solamente de excelencia acad mica sino que debemos conocer c mo un aspirante piensa ejercer sus funciones en vista al funcionamiento cotidiano en relaci n a los profesionales que litigan en las diferentes circunscripciones judiciales todo esto en el marco de la impronta de dinamismo que le piensa impartir desde su funci n el trato con el profesional el personal a su cargo y diversos aspectos que imparte cada juez en su despacho y que marcan la diferencia en cada juzgado
8925959 el consejo debe ser un rgano formador de opini n en diversos aspectos que tengan que ver con reformas judiciales que tiendan a un mejoramiento en el servicio de justicia
8925960 como propuesta se debe avanzar en propiciar la justicia de paz letrada en todos los municipios de la provincia a los efectos de acercar la justicia a la gente implicando un avance en rganos mediadores entre los vecinos del pueblo y las causas de menor cuant a

8925963 through our advocacy on the farm bill we are certain that it was the intent of congress to ensure that there was not an interruption in funding for community food projects
8925964 unfortunately the legislative language was not clear in this regard
8925965 cfsc and its partners have been working hard with the house and senate agriculture committees and usda to ensure that a technical fix passes to allow that the full 5 million is allocated to deserving community groups this fiscal year
8925966 this is a different approach to interactive entertainment and some people may not see it as a game
8925967 i prefer games that are a little more challenging and have some kind of thinking element rather than just observing
8925968 it has a lot of potential but a lot of the consumer base that might really like that type of game may be tough to attract

8925971 america has two great dominant strands of political thought conservatism which at its very best draws lines that should not be crossed and progressivism which at its very best breaks down barriers that should never have been erected

8925980 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy

8925987 northampton town football club can confirm that they have agreed an undisclosed fee with blackburn rovers for goalkeeper mark bunn and the deal will be completed subject to the player passing a medical
8925988 none whatsoever if there was then i wouldnt have bought him in the first place
8925989 he looks like steven reid whos now playing for his country and playing in the first team at blackburn
8925990 there are players down there who can come up and perform in the premiership
8925991 theres no reason why we have to keep looking at 6 7 million players when there are players down there who i feel can perform in the premiership
8925992 vince is a very good player hes played numerous games for his country australia and hes played for years in serie a
8925993 for the first time ever ive signed someone i havent seen play
8925994 but i have spoken to a lot of people i trust in england to find out about the player and they have all been very positive
8925995 the loan moves were a massive success last season josh and sone were a breath of fresh air about the place the move was good for both of them and good for the club and hopefully it can be good for jared too
8925996 jared is a tenacious right back who is good on the ball he has played 25 to 30 games for the first team and he was dying to come here he has turned down a few offers in england to come here and that speaks volumes
8925997 three days ago i had interest from another club but i heard aberdeen were interested and my heart started pounding
8925998 my heart has been set on coming here and ive hardly slept the past three days
8925999 i watched sone aluko and josh walker playing for the club on television and they gave me the inspiration to come here
8926000 the manager gave them a chance here last season and hopefully i can get the same chance to impress i have to prove what i can do before i can expect to start a game
8926001 i am a bit of a surprised to be perfectly honest i dont think it was anything that was mentioned
8926002 we hope he can stay fit because if he does he is a fantastic footballer he is very quick he is mobile he has got a good touch and good hold up play and he can score goals
8926003 we just ask that you watch out for them give them the right of way
8926004 i like deek he is a fantastic footballer and he is a goalscorer who did very well for hibs when he was here
8926005 he is a hibs fan everyone knows that but he is a celtic player at this moment in time so i cant really go too much into that
8926006 im in the market for any striker who scores goals that was my message nothing else
8926007 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away

8926011 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8926012 juries really just dont question blood they expect scientific evidence
8926013 this individual might have gone through a trial and potentially could have been convicted but for the fact that his blood was drawn and analyzed
8926014 it removes any pretense of a neutral magistrate and an objective ruling
8926015 if they refuse to provide a sample of blood to the police that is when we get involved
8926016 we draft a search warrant and present it to the judge and if the judge signs it we give it to the nurse and take the suspects blood
8926017 they are not pulling over people and arresting them and taking blood that couldnt be further from the truth
8926018 alcohol is a big concern this time of year because this is the last big recreational weekend of the summer

8926020 demand for tio2 remains strong higher raw material energy and transportation costs continue to impact our manufacturing expenditures

8926028 i will not bring down the flag of the new party i will make efforts from next week so that our party can meet the requirements for the recognition
8926029 the situation was very volatile and a clash was likely if we pushed on
8926030 we have given way to let them back into the government house to prevent a clash all security forces have left the government compound
8926031 the army will not stage a coup the political crisis should be resolved by political means
8926032 we definitely wont leave the government house until we can topple samaks administration
8926033 he cannot stay on for long i am very sure of that you can see people coming more and more to join us
8926034 growth in the second half of 2008 is expected to moderate following the slower external sector as well as the pass through effects of the higher pump prices of petrol and diesel
8926035 higher fuel prices along with other price increases will reduce net disposable income and affect consumption
8926036 efforts by certain parties to destabilize the country by attempting to seize power though illegitimate means and without the mandate of the people must be rejected
8926037 we cannot allow uncertainties to continue as this will adversely affect foreign investment economic sentiment and the capital markets i will not allow this disturbance to continue
8926038 we need to get on with the business of governing and not waste any more time with opportunistic threats to seize the peoples mandate through undemocratic means
8926039 they still have the audacity to talk about democracy and preach about the democratic process
8926040 we want people to identify their top priorities and the values that are most important to their lives
8926041 then we encourage them to be a little imaginative about what comes next and become less anxious about their new freedom
8926042 forced me to home in on the hard questions what do i really value what do i need as a person
8926043 as i listened to other people discuss their fears and dreams i found myself saying i would like to spend a month in tuscany
8926044 i fear the loss of stimulation that comes with work it gives me meaning and structure
8926045 there would be a loss of friends and even my plumber
8926046 if you want to know what somebody values ask them how they spend their time
8926047 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that

8926049 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
8926050 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8926051 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8926052 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8926053 i never saw her coin play before so i didnt know what to expect
8926054 she played a lot better than i expected she served very well
8926055 i kept thinking play your game and get your first serve in
8926056 it will be like playing a no 1 because she used to be no 1
8926057 im just happy to be back on track without pain
8926058 now all i have to do is put some hard yards on the court and go back out there and work hard
8926059 there is more room to improve hopefully in the next match i can do better
8926060 not too many long rallies but i am serving well
8926061 i better be ready that girl is a tough cookie
8926062 i tried to go to the net more often because he was using the slice a lot
8926063 i tried to make more first serves he gets more nervous when i make my first serve
8926064 ladies and gentlmen in my estimation i think were ready for this threat
8926065 i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so
8926066 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore

8926068 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8926069 we are very glad to see our embraer 190 serving more chinese passengers through the reliable operation of kunpeng airlines
8926070 we believe that the embraer 190 with its superior performance economics and comfort will meet our chinese customers fleet needs and contribute to its growth plans and success
8926071 we are very pleased to take delivery of our first embraer 190 jet which we believe will be an ideal aircraft for us to explore the emerging chinese regional aviation market
8926072 with this reliable new model entering service we will be dedicated to building our company into the most sizable characteristic and competitive regional airline in mainland china
8926073 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8926074 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8926075 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8926076 i have had discussions with representatives of both air canada and westjet about fuel costs and what that is doing to the industry
8926077 if we find passengers in difficult circumstances everybody is going to have to work together to deal with that
8926078 we gaan dan ook een rechtszaak aanspannen om ervoor te zorgen dat mensen anoniem hun steunverklaring kunnen geven

8926153 when she started having trouble breathing they thought it was asthma they gave her a puffer shed go to the doctor once a year and get the latest puffer i didnt think she had asthma if you can run a marathon you dont have asthma
8926154 the doctors thought she had pneumonia they gave her antibiotics the antibiotics didnt do much so they did a lung biopsy
8926155 at first they thought she had stage 1 cancer thats usually treatable we thought that was good there is hope then they decided it was stage 2
8926156 they were going to do two operations the first one to see if the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes
8926157 the second operation was to remove a rib so they could take out part of the lung
8926158 they eventually did an mri and a cat scan and they found cancer in her brain

8926180 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8926181 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8926182 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8926183 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8926184 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8926185 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8926186 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8926187 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8926188 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8926189 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8926191 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8926192 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8926193 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8926194 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8926195 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8926196 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8926197 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8926198 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8926199 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8926200 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8926201 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8926202 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8926203 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8926204 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8926205 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8926206 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8926207 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8926208 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8926209 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8926210 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8926211 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8926212 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8926213 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

8926217 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8926218 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8926219 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8926220 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8926221 queremos hacer conocer que solicitamos al mef y al ministerio de vivienda con fecha 7 de agosto que se apruebe un cr dito suplementario para aprobar los bonos por eso es que mucha gente se qued con los bonos no por no quererlos hacer efectivos por el contrario no hab a fondos

8926223 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8926224 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8926225 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8926226 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8926227 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8926228 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8926229 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8926230 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8926231 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8926232 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8926233 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8926234 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8926235 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8926236 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8926237 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8926238 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8926239 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8926240 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8926241 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8926242 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8926243 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8926244 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8926245 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8926246 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8926247 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8926248 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8926249 a lot of people have got involved in this a huge groundswell of emilys peer group and local people as well have helped us put this together
8926250 we have got 16 teams of 12 people and each individual member has raised 100 which is a fantastic effort

8926252 foreign secretary david miliband has been given one week in which to reconsider the governments refusal to share evidence with mr mohamed that could help prove his innocence
8926253 insufficiently supported in that he had not taken into sufficient account the torture suffered by binyam
8926254 todays judgment discloses the shocking fact that the foreign secretary failed to give any proper weight in secret submissions he made to the court to the abhorrence of torture when he purported to determine that it was in the public interest not to disclose the evidence of ill treatment to our client
8926255 the court has given the foreign secretary a further chance to reconsider his position before passing judgment we await his response with interest
8926256 in der ffentlichkeit hat die it industrie berwiegend das image eines sauberen industriebereichs in dem hochqualifizierte leute arbeiten die ein gutes gehalt bekommen und faszinierende programmierarbeiten verrichten aber die besch ftigen aus den vielen zulieferbetrieben der elektronikindustrie sehen oft nur die andere seite der medaille bis zu 150 berstunden pro monat viel zu niedrige bezahlung und vergiftungen am arbeitsplatz

8926262 this is the first time any vendor has implemented a wireless solution for such a high rise massive spinning and continuously moving structure which meant that we had no prior reference and had to start from scratch in designing developing and deploying the solution the success of this project is an affirmation of our strong technical capability and our ability to innovate i am glad that we were successful in undertaking this unique challenge as it would be an excellent reference site for such future projects
8926263 implementing a wireless lan for the singapore flyer presented significant technical challenges
8926264 we are particularly appreciative of datacrafts project management expertise and its teamwork internally and with cisco systems
8926265 we are very glad that we were able to build the wireless lan for the singapore flyer together with datacraft japan by tapping on its broad consultation capabilities and proven technical expertise plus regional coverage

8926278 like a conversation with several people speaking to several other people at the same time at first glance it seems that each listener perceives just an incomprehensible babel of voices however each listener hears a slightly different noise because the sound waves are scattered in the room which creates interference effects if the listeners combine what they hear skilfully they can filter the original message from the babble this enables significantly more information to be communicated than is possible with conventional technology
8926279 we were already able to show four years ago that a mimo system functions with four transmitters we have gained a considerably better understanding of the basic theoretical principles since then which has allowed us to develop powerful and efficient decoding algorithms this paved the way for the construction of compact receivers
8926280 this would have been impossible without close collaboration between communications theory and chip design vlsi design
8926281 in the shape of our mimo test bed we possess a device that is unique anywhere in the world and which we can now use to try out new ideas and development approaches
8926282 many major companies have missed the boat in this very promising field this is why we founded the spin off company celestrius which now plans to market our development
8926283 many current research questions arise from implementing technology developing a system in the laboratory in one thing but incorporating the technology into marketable products is quite another it suddenly raises issues that we never thought of and these are precisely the aspects that are immensely exciting for researchers like us

8926311 risk assessment officers seem to be more enforcement minded their mindset is to ensure that people are deported
8926312 the culture is to find a reason to reject an applicant
8926313 those are two different mandates it seemed that the same officer never took off the risk assessment hat to look at the humanitarian application
8926314 an h amp c is based on risks inherent in generalized conditions someone might not try to kill me in iraq but it is a dangerous place to be so that could be an undue undeserved and disproportionate hardship appropriate in an humanitarian case
8926315 it just seems that the decision making qualities of the risk assessment officers vary widely

8926331 we believe that the mobile entertainment market will continue to offer significant long term opportunities despite the less buoyant short term outlook resulting from our period of adjustment and macroeconomic conditions we feel that our operations in core european markets will remain stable in the second half of the year with the favourable impact of a number of seasonal factors in the fourth quarter growth compared to the first half of the year will be generated primarily by b2c services in emerging countries and contracts with telephone service providers for the outsourcing of widely deployed services factors contributing to improved profitability compared to the first half of 2008 will include the rationalisation of certain unprofitable services and completion of the plan for integrating itouch it is in this scenario that we confirm the guidance for 2008 which was announced on 7 july 2008

8926343 while conditions in the financial sector have been challenging we believe bankatlantic bancorps stock price has been unfairly depressed largely due to misinformation provided to the market

8926393 the nuba mountains region is a microcosm of the tensions surrounding cpa implementation many local residents feel ignored with good reason by the international community and neglected by the un system
8926394 growing ethnic insecurity in the region has the potential to deteriorate significantly over the coming months and needs urgent attention to prevent it from spiralling out of control
8926395 with the sole exception of abyei kordofan suffers an attention deficit
8926396 the dangers of renewed violent conflict and humanitarian crisis in kordofan have been evident ever since the signing of the cpa
8926397 rather than socio economic integration and political reconciliation lubricated by a development efforts and a peace dividend south kordofan is the locus of an armed standoff with many fearing a return to war
8926398 the potential for armed group activity is fuelled by the large numbers of ex combatants the near absence of a comprehensive reintegration programme since organised hostilities ended in 2005
8926399 without the required co location in training centres the former enemies have separate chains of command training armaments and barracks administration of government and splm controlled areas remains separate two local government systems currently operate in parallel with separate policies for education two languages two systems judicial and security systems and local government structures passing from one area to the other involves passing through armed checkpoints
8926400 if you look at the new developments in the area there is a very big gap between what the report is saying and what is also taking place
8926401 i dont think the reports findings have become invalid but there has been a very big breakthrough in terms of integration of separate administrations and police forces
8926402 i would be the last person to say there are no problems in south kordofan that would be nonsense
8926403 but i think this is a huge step forward and i am amazed that there is hardly any attention for this fact i dont think war will be as inevitable as people have been saying
8926404 unmis has done little to calm tensions in contrast to the active efforts of the much smaller number of unarmed ceasefire monitors the joint military commission jmc which were present from 2002 05 military observers in the un mission in sudan unmis peacekeeping force are insufficiently resourced and supported there are no permanent un civil affairs and human rights officers and international ngos and other independent observers are few
8926405 i dont think that unmis has been weak or has failed in implementing its part of ddr
8926406 there are a lot of preparatory things we had to have in place before we could start
8926407 it would have been a disaster all these prerequisites have now been met and that is why we are moving towards a pilot project
8926408 a combination of weak political will an international community distracted by darfur and unmiss underperformance has led to the failure of cpa implementation in south kordofan many now view war in the nuba mountains as inevitable

8926424 ratifying the compact could allow great lakes water to no longer be held within the public trust and instead be defined as a product for commercial use
8926425 i want to thoroughly understand the lasting impact this compact could have on great lakes water for years to come it took the governors more than three years to get this done so it is not unreasonable for congress to take the time necessary to make sure we are not opening the door for the commercialization of great lakes water

8926480 this is an issue that should have been handled earlier in the season when it became apparent to parents and coaches that this youngster was too talented for his peers his parents should have been notified back then that he needs to find a more competitive league but at the time it was determined that he was too talented at the playoffs was profoundly unfair to the youngster

8926484 theres only so much the coaches or the technical stuff can do because once the athletes get out there everything rests on how they perform at some point the athletes have to bear some responsibility for their performance but i am sure there will be some changes at the top
8926485 een nieuwbouwhuis bestaat ook nog niet op het moment dat je er voor betaalt
8926486 vaak hebben we meer informatie dan mojo al heeft vrijgegeven wij horen van onze bronnen dat de kuip gereserveerd is bij de rolling stones hoorden wij dat het amstel hotel voor de band afgehuurd was soms is het ook speculeren als de toppers n concert aankondigen weet je al dat het er uiteindelijk drie of vier worden
8926487 ik kan wel de eiffeltoren verkopen maar kan hem niet leveren in dat geval is er sprake van oplichting
8926488 er is pas sprake van oplichting op het moment dat het concert geweest is en mensen hun kaarten niet hebben gekregen of op het moment dat het concert uiteindelijk toch niet doorgaat en de klant zijn geld niet terug krijgt dat is bij ons niet het geval klopt de datum of de locatie niet dan krijgt de klant gewoon zijn geld terug inclusief servicekosten
8926489 we hebben goede connecties vorig jaar zaten we er een keer een dag naast met de toppers op zon moment kunnen klanten kaarten krijgen voor de juiste datum of hun geld terug krijgen
8926490 we hebben er ook bij staan dat de datum onder voorbehoud is
8926491 eerder dit jaar dachten wij dat coldplay in het gelredome op zou treden het werd uiteindelijk twee avonden ahoy omdat marco borsato steeds meer extra shows toevoegde de meeste mensen wilden hun tickets alsnog houden

8926509 the court will deny the executives request for a stay
8926510 hence the executive should respond to the document aspect of the subpoenas by producing non privileged material and identifying more specifically the materials it is withholding on a claim of executive privilege
8926511 it is on ms mierss appearance that the dispute principally focuses this decision should not however foreclose the parties continuing attempts to reach a negotiated solution both sides indicated that discussions regarding an accommodation have resumed
8926512 has failed to demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the absolute immunity issue or that it has even raised a question
8926513 the executives argument boils down to a claim that a stay is appropriate because the underlying issue is important
8926514 but that is beside the point and does not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue hence the court concludes that this prong of the stay pending appeal analysis cuts strongly in favor of the committee
8926515 accordingly the department of justice has now filed an appeal in this matter and is also seeking a stay of the decision pending review by the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit
8926516 represents the best hope of promoting an accommodation between the two branches
8926517 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table
8926518 had the litigants indicated that a negotiated solution was foreseeable in the near future the court may have stayed its hand in the hope that further intervention in this dispute by the article iii branch would not be necessary
8926519 as it stands however the court must decide the questions presented to it but there is still ample time for the parties to reach an accommodation the courts july 31 2008 order does not compel ms miers to appear at any particular date
8926520 todays ruling clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock on the committees investigation of doj politicization this congress
8926521 i am heartened that judge bates recognized that the public interest in this matter is best served by the furtherance of the committees investigation the committee intends to promptly schedule a hearing with ms miers and stands ready as always to consider any reasonable offer of accommodation with the white house
8926522 in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity the court therefore rejects the executives claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides
8926523 a limited number of u s attorneys could be targeted for removal and replacement
8926524 theres tons photos of bush appearing blotto drunk at the olympics
8926525 so are bush and his murderous cohorts they savage the world and burn the constitution yet what do we get sanctimonious editorials about john edwards peccadillo please
8926526 the media did condemn larry craig for his airport restroom follies
8926527 yeah but most of that outrage missed the boat by focusing on how craig floats his who cares how rocks are gotten off no his and ilks real transgression is the hypocritical vote getting anti gay agenda they cynically press until you know one of them gets caught with his pants down
8926528 yeah well that and signing a loyalty oathll get me a cup of swill at a halliburton built detention facility one things for sure ill end up in one sooner rather than later if i write what im really thinking
8926529 whatever next all forsaken place the american imperialist war machine decides to pulverize into a fine radioactive dust whether iran or the oil rich plains of the planet gruptar i want the u s to get its ass kicked
8926530 that more u s soldiers would have to die for that to happen
8926531 yeah i get it but their fates and those of untold others were sealed by the jingoistic bloodlust of millions of american yahoos who mindlessly exhorted bushcos slaughter in iraq from the trumped up beginning sure the publics hinky now but thats mainly because gas prices rocket ever skyward no not until america suffers an undisputed all out thoroughly humiliating military defeat is there a chance its global rampage will finally be abated course there might not be a human left alive after such a confrontation but thats another matter
8926532 nor are a million dead innocents or the transformation of the cradle of civilization into a toxic waste dump or that such madness hardly dents the myopic american collective psyche the same appalling apathy that now allows vietnam to be retroactively recast as a righteous cause that should have been doggedly pursued until the freedom bestowing u s military could ultimately produce an honorable victory that in truth could only exist in the reptilian brains of bush and his neocon masters an orwellian reworking of history that first gained traction during the 2004 faux presidential campaign and steamrolls today with the glorification of the gops standard bearing buffoon john drop em if ya got em mccain as some untouchable hero
8926533 i get all that but what about the grieving families of u s military dead
8926534 heres the bloody bottom line anyone stupid and savage enough to join the military now to willingly participate in one mammoth war crime deserves everything he gets
8926535 plus that sort of talk could result in your property being confiscated as per bushs july 17 2007

8926540 lovinsky used to help us all the time were hungry now we have no one
8926541 lovinsky was not a criminal we know when the wealthy are kidnapped the government does everything it can to recover the victim lovinsky is not a dog not an animal he deserves the same treatment as the wealthy people give us a report if hes dead give us the bones and well bury him
8926542 the victims are asking for the key give us the key so we can open the door of justice who are we asking for lovinsky
8926543 your government needs to launch an investigation but on lovinsky they dont want to do anything
8926544 the preval government continues the policies of the latortue coup government
8926545 on the social and economic plane we can work with him

8926550 we the undersigned believe that a healthy food system is necessary to meet the urgent challenges of our time
8926551 a clear and commonly held framework for future action to educate citizens and policy makers
8926552 this declaration is a call to action by and for all americans
8926553 the purpose of u s food and agriculture must change and it can no longer focus on the production of cheap calories conditions demand a more holistic approach to human and community health that begins on our farms and ranches
8926554 this declaration which is being crafted by a broad coalition is the preamble for the next generation of farm policy and we hope it will stimulate the discussion to help get us there
8926555 behind us stands a half century of industrial food production underwritten by cheap fossil fuels abundant land and water resources and a drive to maximize the global harvest of cheap calories
8926556 ahead lie rising energy and food costs a changing climate declining water supplies a growing population and the paradox of widespread hunger and obesity
8926557 a spectre is haunting the cities and villages of most developing nations warns a senior official of a world bank affiliated organization
8926558 its the spectre of a food fuel and water crisis says lars thunell
8926559 keeping water under local public and democratic control is the most just way to insure the greatest degree of water access for the greatest number of people
8926560 the movement to create better food and agriculture in the u s has been slowly and steadily gaining ground for well over a decade
8926561 the publics increasing interest and the medias deepening coverage of climate change energy agriculture labor issues food costs food quality and obesity may finally illuminate the interrelationship of these crises and provide a context for urgently needed changes
8926562 confirmed that a tight cadre of lobbyists control the debate to protect the status quo rather than aid the population of the nation
8926563 for a radically different approach to food and agriculture we believe that the food system must be reorganized on a foundation of health
8926564 the development of just and sustainable regional farm and food networks
8926565 most all the major organizations seeking reform in agriculture in the u s have signed on to the declaration the challenge remains to bring in more of the current mainstream
8926566 slow food nation is part of a mosaic that can help change food policy in the u s

8926598 the thing is i dont think this is a bad thing for us it is very fraught but i think that comes more from the radical social and cultural transitions taking place than from the wrongness or badness of it we all must learn to be more aware and sensitive to our shifting social selves
8926599 surprised that people can turn this womans death into comedy or rail on about how she happened to be a prostitute a disabled one at that and spend as much time talking about her record for non violent crimes and criminal lifestyle as they do oh about the fact that she was murdered
8926600 being hurtful and shameful in the name of trying to bully someone to see your point is doing nothing to further your cause it doesnt show your side which could be full of great points but it sure as hell makes you look like a jerk
8926601 figuring that out coming to terms with it when you add that to the societal programming we all go through that tells us our bodies are simultaneously shameful dirty and gross it can lead a budding feminist to feel covering up is the thing to do it also seems to lead other budding feminists to believe taking it off is the thing to do these reactions have long puzzled me not because they dont make sense but because i think theyre two sides of the same coin that coin being coming to full ownership of your body

8926632 the brightness and dry finish of the colors is a graphic arresting kind of combination
8926633 youre not aware if youre looking at a printed piece or a painting not really sure why or for whom the work was created
8926634 what inspires me is when i can take a confluence of separate themes and unify them as if they create one message
8926635 an uneasy pictorial absurdity is achieved these paintings pose questions not answers

8926726 first its been years since we played a stage small enough that we could actually see each other usually keith murray guitarist is just a vague figure bouncing around in the distance last night he was close enough to touch
8926727 i think most people left feeling that they had seen one of the greatest cover bands out there were definitely in the top five
8926728 well people have different ideas about what truly constitutes metal so maybe there was some confusion
8926729 metal isnt all i listen to of course but there was a period of time where it was
8926730 i guess it started in school i started listening to stuff with screaming in it and then i started exploring more metal myspace helped me a lot and friends will tell me about certain bands and some of the bands i like arent necessarily
8926731 i love the devil wears prada theyre more hardcore but theyre awesome
8926732 and job for a cowboy is another band i love
8926733 youve got vocals that i cant do the double bass drums the incredible guitar solos every part of the band does more difficult stuff than your average rock band does i listen to these bands and i wish i could do all of that but i cant
8926734 i was the little girl in the red dress and red lipstick and i totally didnt fit in but i had so much fun
8926735 it was awesome i lost my shoes i was going crazy it was awesome
8926736 i would love to secretly do some work on a metal bands album
8926737 i wish i could just secretly do vocals and nobody would know its me
8926738 one time they were actually listening to metal and i was like what are you guys doing listening to metal
8926739 they took a lot of their stage ideas from metal bands from like europe and they use a lot of pyro and stuff like that but they like metal they dont listen to death metal but theyre definitely not opposed to it which i think is really cool it shows that theyre not just some pop band
8926740 even more amped to be able to start playing shows and work on our new material
8926741 and i hate saying that but what i mean is like madonna she can be hanging out and laughing and then you put the camera on her and its like holy sh
8926742 it was the hardest video ive ever edited because every moment was great
8926743 every moment that she was on camera she was amazing shes got an incredible quality about her she
8926744 she came out in these high heel boots and i was going to say something to her about them
8926745 but on her own she was like id feel better in sneakers her instincts are great she has great charisma and personality
8926746 she started showing me all of her personal items from under her bed that her ex boyfriend gave her so she pulled out his dirty socks and a bunch of photographs
8926747 the necklace shes wearing in the video is the necklace he gave her
8926748 she was very down to earth and its kind of very popular for little girls in the entertainment industry to be kind of bratty
8926749 i couldnt believe how many people wanted to visit the video set and ive worked with people like mariah and madonna she was very gracious and shes very smart she really knows her stuff look whether she wins or not i think shell make a great transition from being a teen star shes very conscientious of her persona and of the crossover
8926750 you can tell by the lyrics that theyre very personal and thats how shell make that transition the stuff she talks about in the video is clever and emotional and fun at the same time you can be 18 and enjoy it too
8926751 we are looking into this and investigating how it could have happened
8926752 the equipment is so new and we have our official opening this weekend it is safe otherwise we could not let children use it and we have no intention of closing the area
8926753 we will contact the town council to find out exactly what happened
8926754 we will make no decision on whether to investigate until we have had that conversation and found out the circumstances
8926755 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called daddy yankee a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
8926756 like i said with me my whole philosophy on blacks and latinos is were all one were in the same ghettos same inner cities and were suffering from the same problems every problem the blacks have the latinos have theres two systems of health care the one for the rich thats really good then theres the one for the inner city where they leave ladies in the emergency room unattended for 24 hours until they drop dead people dont even check on her hours after shes dead this is normal stuff this is whats happening in the u s
8926757 why should my man daddy yankee be endorsing mccain this is the only urban guy in the universe to endorse john mccain you got people who look up to yankee young teenagers that look up to him and might make the wrong choice john mccain is the wrong thing to do i dont think the republicans care much about minorities i cant believe yankee went and endorsed this guy
8926758 daddy yankee endosa a mccain cacos ya saben por qui n no podr n ir a votar

8926768 us still working on revised draft and india still demanding
8926769 as aca had predicted but to the apparent surprise of the indian and us governments more than 20 states essentially said no thanks and proposed more than 50 amendments and modifications that would establish some basic but vitally important restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india
8926770 many of these amendments track with the restrictions and conditions established in 2006 us legislation regulating us nuclear trade with india which include the termination of nuclear trade if india resumes testing a ban on the transfer of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technology a requirement for permanent and unconditional facility specific safeguards and a review mechanism
8926771 it continues to be an extraordinarily complex problem we need to continue to press on it there are areas there are areas that we can do better there are areas that the pakistan military can do better we understand that its an area i think we can all improves on but it isnt it is not going to be something that gets solved overnight
8926772 there is a significant amount of political churn in pakistan that hes general kiyani very much aware of

8926774 i should say yes the postponement of champions trophy is a big blow for pakistan

8926781 this news is very disappointing particularly as plans have been put in place for a number of high profile members of the gaelic community in canada to visit this years royal national mod in falkirk
8926782 it is hoped alternative arrangements can be made without too much difficulty
8926783 my concerns are for the individual travellers and musicians who may well have relied on the low fares zoom offered and will find it very difficult to replace their ticket with a full commercial rate ticket with another airline particularly at such short notice with the mod just a few weeks away
8926784 i didnt like to ask the exact nature of what happened i just know it involved a digger

8926803 the general consensus amongst industry professionals is that a new generation of home consoles will arrive on the market in 2011 or 2012
8926804 is the fact that they dont have a significantly larger storage medium than the previous systems its a slightly bigger dvd disc if were filling up the disc right now where are we going its not like our games are going to get any smaller
8926805 in terms of specific things blu ray hasnt made much difference the original game fits on a 360 disk so it wasnt like we were in need of room
8926806 its not inconceivable that you might have a next gen xbox with a relatively simple cpu
8926807 just a couple of biggish out of order cores and then some larrabee like monster handling graphics physics ai and so on
8926808 as its philosophically similar to larrabee the problem is that the only workload on a console that is currently parallelised is graphics and thats the one thing the cell doesnt do real time physics and complex ai will become more important on consoles as will more programmable graphics ray tracing is one example so highly parallel and programmable larrabee or cell chips look like the way forward
8926809 pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 and will have to extend the consoles lifespan
8926810 were looking at the last generation of consoles theres not going to be an xbox 720 or a ps4 ill make that bet not going to happen
8926811 people ask me how many people i have working on the next generation on the one hand its everybody on the other its nobody people are continuously working on new technology
8926812 we want the police to send out the policemen who gave the orders and the police who hurt people
8926813 we ask them to come out by 7 00pm otherwise we will bring 100 000 protesters to surround the police headquarters
8926814 their results have definitely surprised us after the quadrangular series having lost to them in the third fourth play off and having won the pool matches against them
8926815 the team hasnt changed that much but they seem to have had a change in management and have had a good amount of match practice
8926816 the climate conditions and wickets are going to be very different its definitely going to be a challenge especially as england are in form but we are very optimistic and confident about our success
8926817 were not targeting any specific england players as a team they seem to have done very well recently
8926818 we will be looking to get out the top order early on and get the batters out who have been getting lots of runs recently and put some pressure on the other players
8926819 i am delighted that the donmars production of piaf is transferring to the west end we are enormously proud of it and particularly pleased that all the people who were unable to see it at the donmar will now have an opportunity to catch it in its limited run at the vaudeville theatre

8926823 we dont need 4 more years of the last 8 years
8926824 news has broken and we need a team on the ground to tell it
8926825 for the past 30 years researchers have been preserving therapeutic proteins by freeze drying them and coating them with a thin layer of various formulations of glass like sugars that act to stabilize their molecular structures this allows them to be safely stored for extended periods of time
8926826 pharmaceutical companies though they have general guidelines develop their formulations essentially by trial and error and have to wait up to two years to see if the glasses are suitable
8926827 instead of needing relaxation measurements that require using neutron scattering in a national facility with limited time availability we have developed a widely accessible solution in the form of readily available steady state fluorescence measurements
8926828 this will allow pharmaceutical companies to adopt the new metrology weve developed
8926829 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
8926830 it didnt cure the mouse but they were able to reduce their blood sugar levels to near normal
8926831 the presently accepted regenerative medicine idea is that you make a stem cell from a patient bring it back to the beginning as it were then you are left with the problem of how to instruct that cell to become a beta cell or a motor neuron
8926832 we asked the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning could you go from one cell type to another
8926833 i would say within five years we could be ready to start human trials
8926834 this adds to the large and growing list of studies helping to make embryonic stem cells irrelevant to medical progress
8926835 hes angry and ready for a fight he is innocent we will try this case it is nothing but a false accusation

8926839 for an employer to go ahead and take it upon themselves to report that is unusual
8926840 theres no obligation on my part to go call law enforcement
8926841 regardless of whether they were an illegal alien legal immigrant or an american citizen it still wouldnt have mattered they still would have been reported
8926842 when people are being prescreened before a decision to hire is being made then you could have exposure to discrimination charges
8926843 i think employers are beginning to feel the pinch and in many cases i think they are trying not only to be sort of extra cautious but to be pre emptive
8926844 whats troubling is that employers have taken it upon themselves the job of ascertaining whether a crime has been committed
8926845 im a struggling writer who loves to bang hot chicks and i still have feelings for my ex woe is me
8926846 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself

8926865 i have a question related to sql server consolidation you know that the physical memory on any machine is limited and sql server tends to consume all available memory lets say i am consolidation two sql servers the first one consumes 1gb of memory and the second one is consuming 1gb of memory i tempt to say that we need 2gb when consolidating but what if i have only 1 5gb available on the target server will the performance suffer if i consolidate two servers and make then only 1 5 gb available do you have any ideas on how to estimate memory requirements in this case the same applies to cpu and io as well

8926916 either risk management is not being done correctly or it is not contributing to the success of the project
8926917 if we have a situation where the majority of owners and contractors believe they are effectively managing project risk and yet only 34 of them complete more than 80 of their projects on time and in budget a fairly poor reflection we come back to the question of why is the project performance poor
8926918 individuals tend to be inherently optimistic and overconfident not giving enough weight to historical data and maintaining an optimistic outlook in spite of evidence also the strategic bias was to put forward a project in the best possible light in order to get project approval and so overstate benefits and underestimate the cost and time obstacles
8926919 project owners want their significant methods of controlling and passing the risk down to the contractor obviously the contractors are becoming less likely to accept this risk and the contractors in turn are going to pass it down to their suppliers and vendors but they are not going to take too much more of that so risk is going to ramp up to be a project owners risk
8926920 the big shift in the last couple of years has moved the balance of power to the contractor whereas many years ago the contractors were at the mercy of the owners the owners could dictate and quite often could squeeze them for price now because of the supply demand there is so much demand for contracting capability and capacity the contractors are able to push up the price and that is why the margins we are seeing with all the results of the companies are a lot better than we have seen in many many years and some of the risk is being transferred so some of the risk that the contractors used to take is being passed back to the owners

8926922 the u s economy expanded faster than previously estimated in the second quarter helped by a surge in exports that will probably wane as europe and japan head toward recessions
8926923 the expansion is likely to weaken in the second half as consumers burdened with falling home values and dwindling job prospects rein in spending separate figures today showed the number of americans collecting unemployment benefits reached a five year high last week
8926924 u s economic growth in the second quarter was much stronger than previously believed but it could represent the high water mark for the economy for at least the next year
8926925 weak banks exhausted consumers and cautious hiring are expected to drag down growth in coming quarters and with no end in sight for the drop in house prices economists are unable to see an end to the financial market stress that is holding back activity

8927037 a spike on top of a spike just as theres a sigh of relief about prices people are seeing them below that 3 50 a gallon then yeah it would be a worst case scenario to see a spike on top of a spike

8927198 if the gospel of jesus christ can be proclaimed as a theology of self esteem imagine the health this could generate in society
8927199 i dont think anything has been done in the name of christ that and under the banner of christianity that has proven more destructive to human personality and hence counterproductive to the evangelism enterprise than the often crude uncouth and unchristian strategy of attempting to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition

8927249 women commonly fake orgasm because they dont want to wound their partners egos
8927250 that said there are no pros to faking it if you fake it ultimately the only one getting faked out is you it really damages your sexual self worth eventually youll start to think that you cant have an orgasm and youll wind up feeling like somethings wrong with you the crux is its important for you as a woman to be able to exhibit a range of sexual responsiveness that doesnt reflect on your man its important for you to be true to yourself
8927251 in this day and age women need to be authentic with their sexuality
8927252 they need to be able to tell their partners im really exhausted i may not be able to come that will keep your orgasm or his inability to give you one from becoming a huge issue in a weird way that honesty will give you the freedom to have orgasms more often in the long run
8927253 it is absolutely okay if one of you gets off and the other doesnt as long as thats not happening all the time
8927254 so tell your guy im not in the mood but go ahead you never know his sexual appetite just might ignite your own and once the pressures off you might very well find that youre suddenly relaxed enough to come

8927317 the traditional relevance and contribution of ashgold football club will be protected we can state categorically that the club will not be relocated from its base in obuasi neither will its name be changed anglogold ashanti believes that ultimately the club should not be just an attachment of its mining operations but should be a professionally managed independent football club with a commitment to excellence
8927318 the new stanford findings further confirm the futility of embryonics in human therapy despite what proponents of human esc research have been promising that transplanted esc can mature into several different types of tissue those cells could not survive in the mouse suggesting the same would likely occur in a patient
8927319 i think theres some promise to human escs but you dont want to be foolish and say these cells are going to cure things in the next five years
8927320 the injection of escs into patients because they also have the potential to become cancerous
8927321 with over 100 diseases already being treated with repair stem cells by the worlds finest doctors the need for further esc research merely to add to 10 years of futility is called into question

8927333 orthopaedic intervention for stroke patients can help to maximize the chances that the affected arm for example may still be useful for activities of daily life
8927334 it is critical for the orthopaedic surgeon to become involved in the management of these patients immediately following the stroke to ensure the best possible outcome
8927335 during this time patients and families are primarily focused on the cognitive effects of the injury
8927336 but it is important to remember that there are numerous non surgical treatments that should be employed to maximize the functional use of the affected limb
8927337 it becomes crucial to consider surgery to reduce or eliminate painful muscle spasms and correct deformities the type of surgery performed depends on which areas are affected and whether or not the limb has been determined to be functional
8927338 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8927339 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8927340 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8927341 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8927342 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8927343 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8927344 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
8927345 further investigations are needed to sort out effects of radiation and confounders in existing and planned studies of radiation exposed cohorts and new laboratory studies are needed to explore biological mechanisms for low dose radiation related cardiovascular effects
8927346 the low dose radiation effects on cardiovascular disease risk are likely to remain challenging and controversial even more so than the linear no threshold arguments for cancer risk that are debated to this day but should not be dismissed
8927347 by adding pediatric heart transplantation to the full range of care we offer our youngest patients we better meet the significant health needs of our bronx community
8927348 the long standing impact of social economic and access to healthcare issues means children in the bronx suffer from a disproportionate number of congenital heart abnormalities and other serious conditions now they have access to the high quality care they need right in their own community
8927349 the new pediatric heart transplant program at cham and its acclaimed cardiology team are important milestones for both montefiore and einstein
8927350 dr daphne hsu and her team are outstanding clinical investigators and national leaders in the study and treatment of pediatric heart disease and transplantation their presence here is a tangible demonstration of our joint efforts to strengthen the links between einstein research and montefiore medicine
8927351 the pediatric heart transplant program and the addition of dr hsu and her team greatly enhance our capabilities for treating any heart abnormality in children
8927352 the childrens hospital at montefiore has become a hospital of choice for patients and families from around the world seeking excellence and innovation in specialty care building one of americas finest childrens hospitals in the bronx reinforces montefiores commitment to improving the health of its community by offering our patients access to the highest quality care and services available anywhere in the world

8927377 as they capture mosquitoes that have had a blood meal and thus more opportunity to become infected
8927378 each female mosquito has the potential to produce about 200 eggs and she can have as many as five cycles so when we capture a gravid mosquito that can remove as many as 500 females
8927379 sampling the species in urban environments has been a challenge until studies on its oviposition cues allowed the development of gravid female traps that collect mostly females that previously have blood fed and therefore had a chance to become infected
8927380 to not only us but third world countries where culex quinquefasciatus is a problem
8927381 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism
8927382 we found that some 25 percent of the genes in our model organism appear to be under clock control i wasnt suspecting anything remotely like that
8927383 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signaling processes
8927384 but perhaps the most important role weve seen so far is the clocks role in ribosome biogenesis
8927385 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signaling pathways
8927386 the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems
8927387 other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants but the evidence has been conflicting
8927388 this study is large enough and we were able to control for enough complicating factors that we feel confident there is a true difference these results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression
8927389 this is a major milestone for tomotherapy and in turn for cancer centers of all sizes

8927393 we found that if e2f3a is present the animals can develop normally through adulthood even when all the other genes are absent
8927394 if the e2f3a gene was doing something unique replacing it with one of the others should prevent development
8927395 we conclude from this that it is the genes location in the genome plus the timing and level of its activity that makes it so important during development

8927402 because of the large deformation signals from the dike intrusion we needed to do some detailed detective work to prove the existence of this slow earthquake
8927403 we used state of the art insar satellite data to constrain the dike source and that allowed us to demonstrate the existence of the slow earthquake motions recorded by the gps stations on kilaueas flank
8927404 a dike intrusion could be seen with the seismic monitoring network the tiltmeters and the gps network but these slow earthquakes can only be seen with the gps network
8927405 these slow earthquakes are an interesting phenomenon that has only been studied within the last decade and were still trying to figure out how they fall into the bigger picture of earthquakes says cecily wolfe also an associate professor in higp and another co author
8927406 theyre definitely a part of the earthquakes cycle and trying to understand how they relate to other earthquakes and how they may be generated and triggered will give us greater insights into how predicable earthquakes are
8927407 predicting how much damage will occur to oil platforms and rigs is a difficult task
8927408 these platforms and rigs may have sustained damage due to past storms and like anything else become more susceptible to threats of wind and storm surge
8927409 if one major deep water production platform is destroyed youre talking about a 1 billion or more loss
8927410 if its multiple rigs and platforms in a variety of water depths then were talking billions of dollars
8927411 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
8927412 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
8927413 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8927414 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8927415 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
8927416 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8927417 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8927418 the best way to limit the need for human rabies vaccine is simply to make sure pets are vaccinated we know that dogs and cats are not the most common animals found rabid in the united states but they are the animals most frequently involved in multiple human exposures
8927419 your local veterinarian plays a key role in controlling rabies
8927420 the objective of echocrt is to demonstrate that optimal medical therapy plus crt reduces all cause mortality or first hospitalization for worsening heart failure in the study population compared to optimal medical therapy alone
8927421 echocrt will provide valuable scientific evidence for this large group of heart failure patients who currently lack treatment options beyond pharmacological therapy
8927422 cardiac resynchronization is a proven life saving device based treatment for certain heart failure patients with ventricular dyssynchrony that is discoordinated pumping action of the heart
8927423 previous randomized controlled trials with crt have been limited to patients with a so called wide qrs an electrocardiogram ecg anomaly that shows longer than normal ventricular activity qrs width 120 130 ms who represent only 30 of all subjects with chronic heart failure echocrt is designed to demonstrate whether patients with ventricular dyssynchrony but narrow qrs or normal ventricular electrical activity on the ecg may derive the same life saving benefits from crt device therapy as other heart failure patients
8927424 the clinical community has long been intrigued as to whether narrow qrs heart failure patients with ventricular dyssynchrony would benefit from crt
8927425 the echocrt study has been designed under guidance from an executive steering committee of 11 internationally renowned academic specialists in electrophysiology heart failure and echocardiography who carefully considered earlier studies in developing the echocrt design biotronik is proud to support this trial which is part of our enduring commitment to landmark clinical research to provide physicians with scientifically sound evidence on which to base their clinical decisions biotronik is also committed to improving patient outcomes and to achieve this the company has significantly expanded its clinical trial program and has embarked on four large international landmark trials including echocrt
8927426 chronic heart failure is associated with a poor prognosis with considerably shortened survival and repeated hospitalizations the vast majority of patients with heart failure present with a narrow qrs and do not currently receive crt the echocrt trial will test the hypothesis whether crt improves outcomes in this large subset of heart failure patients

8927432 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to date that looked at using this inexpensive and commonly used treatment to reduce the occurrence of cerebral palsy after preterm birth
8927433 cerebral palsy cant always be prevented but the data from our study and its predecessors will help obstetricians make informed treatment decisions for the women under their care
8927434 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulfate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants

8927670 this is an extraordinary discovery that together with the small quantity of bones recovered in the dig strongly suggests we have located the grave of private fisher and we wait with some confidence for formal identification by australian and vietnamese forensic specialists

8927688 we killed ourselves with turnovers mental errors they took advantage of the mistakes we made

8927711 der markt der digitalen steckt hierzulande noch in den kinderschuhen ein partnerprogramm netzwerk wie digibux de nach dem amerikanischen vorbild clickbank com wird dazu beitragen eine transparente bersicht ber deutschsprachige info produkte zu bekommen
8927712 deshalb wollten wir von it leitern deren sichtweise erfahren um damit andere kollegen z b aus dem einkauf f r diese thema zu sensibilisieren
8927713 manager aus dem controlling und einkauf k nnen die mitarbeiter in der it noch mehr unterst tzen betriebswirtschaftlich im sinne des eigenen unternehmens zu handeln
8927714 die produktionen sind national regional und sogar lokal au erordentlich verschieden die vielfalt der themen denkweisen und macharten spiegelt aufschlussreich und spannend was in europa geschieht
8927715 von den m glichen gegnern ist das der beste also auch der schwierigste um gegen sevilla zu bestehen m ssen wir eine starke leistung zeigen
8927716 der erste gedanke war das 6 0 von posen gegen den grasshopper club wir werden sicher erkundungen einziehen wir haben mit jacek bak ja auch einen polen im kader das ist nicht unbedingt ein wunschgegner aber wir m ssen nehmen was kommt
8927717 wir nehmen es wie es kommt italien ist ein sch nes land viele machen dort urlaub wir fahren zum fu ballspielen hin wir m ssen eine besondere leistung bringen um in die gruppenphase einzuziehen
8927718 ein sehr ambitioniertes los unsere chance sehe ich bei 50 50 sicher haben wir den attraktivsten gegner aller deutschen vereine gezogen
8927719 das ist das wunschlos von unserem trainer lucien favre der auf keinen fall gegen seinen ex club fc z rich spielen wollte wir gehen in diese duelle mit der klaren zielsetzung dass wir die gruppenphase erreichen wollen
8927720 ich freue mich ber das los weil ich noch nie in irland gewesen bin wir m ssen aufpassen weil sie den tabellenzweiten aus schweden eliminiert haben
8927721 das ist kein gegner den man untersch tzen darf denn sie haben roter stern belgrad ausgeschaltet von daher kann man nicht sagen dass das ein kleiner gegner ist ich kann mich erinnern dass ajax amsterdam mal dort gespielt und sich sehr schwer getan hat
8927722 es war uns klar dass wir einen schweren gegner bekommen werden wir h tten lieber erst ein ausw rtsspiel gehabt vom namen her ist rapid bukarest verglichen mit anderen m glichen gegnern nicht so attraktiv aber das genau ist die gefahr
8927723 um mich ber den gegner zu informieren werde ich auf jeden fall mit lothar matth us sprechen hnlich wie zuletzt gegen gy r ist auch dieser kontrahent eine gro e unbekannte trotz allem kann unser ziel nur das erreichen der gruppenphase sein
8927724 wir gehen als favorit in die begegnung und wollen in die gruppenphase einziehen
8927725 unirea urziceni ist ein neuling im europ ischen wettbewerb und f hrt die rum nische liga nach f nf spieltagen an dennoch sind wir davon berzeugt dass wir uns durchsetzen und in die gruppenphase einziehen
8927726 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went
8927727 i think its pretty clear that its going to pass the senate
8927728 with no indication that anybody is opposed to it i assume it would pass with at least as overwhelming as the house bill
8927729 were optimistic this can be the vehicle that can move forward and restore the original intent of the ada
8927730 were definitely optimistic that the senate will recognize the importance of this and move forward
8927731 the senate bill builds upon the success of the house bill
8927732 however it seeks to broaden the definition of disability in a way that maximizes bipartisan consensus and minimizes unintended consequences
8927733 our bill leaves the adas familiar disability language intact a person with a disability is one who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the individual
8927734 it does not substitute the term materially restricts as in the house bill instead the bill takes several specific and general steps that individually and in combination direct courts to take a more generous meaning and application of the definition
8927735 the biggest difference between that bill and the house is the definition
8927736 both the senate and the house bills embody that common ground were comfortable with both of them
8927737 the real thing that needs to be celebrated here is the process
8927738 at the end of the day we support both bills
8927739 our goal has been to try to get this on the presidents desk this year

8927747 there comes a time in the life of every good looking millionaire actor when nine out of 10 of women will agree to have sex with them
8927748 at this point many of them find themselves trapped in the horrendous position of having a tremendous amount of sex
8927749 generally it is the young single actors who are able to cope with having sex 10 or 12 times a day without becoming clinically addicted
8927750 but there are still too many married middle aged actors whose wives have fantastic lawyers who suddenly become consumed by this crippling medical condition

8927818 i write tiny little items for the business desk every week and careers stories every month but this one was for the national desk and they sought me out it involves spying workplace issues discrimination and the fbi and more
8927819 well my resume says i was there from november 2003 through february 2005 though it seems much longer than that
8927820 i am glad every day not to work at the star
8927821 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
8927822 i should say yes the postponement of champions trophy is a big blow for pakistan
8927823 i really dont know why the south africa team refused to participate in the tournament in pakistan even after initially giving their nod it is also unfortunate that australia and england also raised security concern
8927824 the pcb is in shambles now they have no chairman no direction we are really struggling to recover
8927825 he is only 23 year old now he has committed a mistake but i would like to give him another chance
8927826 once i recommended his name as pakistan captain to the pcb but he has not delivered malik should believe on himself and lead from the front
8927827 we lack quality coaches in india perhaps they are the best available but they should be sent abroad to familiarise themselves with the latest coaching methods
8927828 what bindra said about lack of coaches in our country is fully correct the fact is that we do not have competent coaches the foreigners are far superior our coaches are just good enough for the beginners
8927829 i support abhinavs comments he is pretty much correct in what he says the biggest problem here is that for events like olympics or world championships you cannot really train under the coaches you have around here
8927830 i cannot blame the present day coaches for the kind of money that we pay no indian could consider coaching as an option on the other hand we are ready to pay rs 30 000 for a days training to a foreign coach
8927831 we think that having foreign coaches are sure shot ways to success but we are not ready to develop our own coaches
8927832 like bindra said we should plan for 2016 olympics the immediate goal should be to get our own coaches equipped enough so that they can groom our shooters during competitions
8927833 our own shooters could be made coaches but none would opt for the job if he is paid just rs 15 000 or 20 000 a month
8927834 we badly need to have qualified ceos to administer the sport and be accountable
8927835 he made a good point when he sought appointment of ceos to bring in accountability which will enhance performance
8927836 ceos is a performance based job that is what is in vogue internationally you have to ensure results and accountability if you are looking at transformation from three to 10 or 20 medals by 2016
8927837 a political will is needed to further strengthen the police force including giving them more legal powers and resources i requested the prime minister to immediately pass gujarats law against organised crime which has been passed twice by the assembly and has been lying with the centre for the past four years
8927838 it is important to understand that this law exists in maharashtra and if a bomb blast takes place they can use it but if it happens in gujarat just 50 km away i dont have the law
8927839 i want to tell those politicians who have their minds filled with vote bank politics that there were terrorist activities even when pota was in force and that despite having section 302 of ipc which gives death penalty for murder murders do take place does this mean we remove this clause
8927840 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8927841 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8927842 this transaction is consistent with iamgolds strategy of rationalizing our structure and significantly reducing cash costs at all of our operations
8927843 we continue to demonstrate our focus on operational efficiencies and costs at our operations with the long term objective of reducing our cash costs below the industry average
8927844 our generators kick on and we didnt miss a call
8927845 the emergency generator kick on as it always does within eight to ten seconds
8927846 we didnt experience any delays there was no period of time without electricity
8927847 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined

8927862 the large and growing unmet need for pediatric hiv aids services demonstrates that failure of our pmtct programs to avert parent to child transmission of hiv
8927863 if we prevent hiv infection in children then we do not need to take care of them when they are infected
8927864 cultural beliefs social stigma ignorance and economic status influenced the mothers attitudes and preference for the different feeding alternatives
8927865 deny their spouses the opportunity to participate in the program
8927866 we have a moral obligation to ensure that our children and grandchildren are born and remain free from hiv aids
8927867 investigators have assumed that asthma is not a complication of pediatric hiv infection
8927868 it was not until the era of haart which restored the t cell levels that an increased incidence of asthma was noted
8927869 to understand why marginalized populations are at higher risk of infection you have to recognize that these groups often do not have equal access to housing education health care clean drinking water or nutrition
8927870 marginalized groups also face discrimination and have less control of funding streams for health and social welfare purposes
8927871 enjoy rights and a quality of life much higher than do people in other nations
8927872 legal system acknowledges constitutional and civil rights but not human rights
8927873 void when it comes to advocating for the right to quality health care for everyone
8927874 without equal access to quality health care the epidemic will only continue to increase in much of the world
8927875 some societies are busy playing the blame game to avoid taking on their fair share of the systematic responsibility for infections the medical community aids service organizations and human service agencies around the world are in the trenches trying to save lives
8927876 we will never have enough resources to defeat this epidemic if we dont have the support of our communities
8927877 indian people are dying across this country from inadequate health care
8927878 it seems as though they believe a certain number of native american people are expendable

8927962 they were still doing business yesterday morning clearly knowing that this was going to happen the problem is that our money has gone into their account and we have to go through the process of trying to retrieve it
8927963 you can print out your e ticket youve got your receipt etc but unfortunately there was nobody available to speak to us from zoom
8927964 we tried for over two hours last night with the bank trying to discuss ways to stop the money going into their account but unfortunately theres nothing that they can do
8927965 we looked at various other airlines and the cost as you know has increased greatly it was just one of these super deals but you know it was just one of those things if its too good to be true then it isnt
8927966 we dont normally go with low cost airlines thats a fact but the direct flight from glasgow was the pinnacle of the selling feature
8927967 unfortunately i think id rather go with a company thats been around for a long long time and there is some assurance to passengers in this event that you would get compensation at this moment were not clear if we will be entitled to our money back as a result of the insolvency
8927968 basically they just kept people waiting and kept coming back and telling us well give you more information no final answers nothing at all until 6 oclock when basically they told us youre out of luck
8927969 were trying to find tickets at the moment but theyre all about 1 500 really really expensive
8927970 at the moment it looks like im going to be about 2 000 more in debt theres no other way i can pay for it it was all budgeted out but now its going to be very expensive its going to come out of our school accounts for food our living because as students we dont have that money available
8927971 i would love to just jump on a plane i was just talking to a lady who just threw her visa down and said get me home but we cant do that we dont have that luxury
8927972 we flew in from portugal where we live booked into the holiday inn saw a tv reporter and asked her what all the excitement was only to be told zoom went bust at 7 oclock
8927973 weve looked at alternate flights getting from glasgow to london was the problem and unless were prepared to pay about 3 000 each each way so youre talking 12 000 there was no way we could do it
8927974 so weve called it quits now were going back to portugal
8927975 i feel heartily sorry for all the passengers obviously but i also feel sorry for the boyle brothers who founded the airline they must be in a terrible state
8927976 theyve got all these people and theres little they can do as i can gather they were trying to get a rescue package until the last minute which probably accounts for why nobody knew anything

8928090 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8928091 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8928092 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
8928093 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8928094 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11

8928114 ive got a nine piece band including a horn section and violinist with me and were all enjoying it so much
8928115 the problem has been what to include as there is so much material to go at stardom road is basically full of fans favourites with the odd unusual selection thrown in
8928116 i think that at first dave ball his partner in soft cell and i came to resent tainted love as we felt we had more to offer
8928117 it was just such a big hit here and in america but i think that every artist who has a successful record goes through a period of hating it as you go on you can apreciate how it opened so many doors and now i really enjoy performing it
8928118 with soft cell i was very much at the front of everything and the pressure on you is considerable
8928119 now im really enjoying myself doing all the old songs with a new group of musicians and getting a new angle on them some of the songs are a very different version from the original but i think weve retained the essence of the song
8928120 i think fans appreciate that i have always been true to myself i have a distinctive voice which i appreciate people may love or hate but i think fans trust me and my taste in music and they are prepared to go with things that they might not otherwise have heard
8928121 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story

8928125 the export to india between january and june 2008 has jumped to usd 4 125 04 and import from india has increased to usd 2 47 450 in the first six months of 2008
8928126 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
8928127 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
8928128 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8928129 this election has never been about me its about you
8928130 its a moment in our history that well never forget
8928131 most times people are offering thousands of dollars to get out of politicians speeches
8928132 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
8928133 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
8928134 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
8928135 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
8928136 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
8928137 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
8928138 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8928139 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
8928140 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
8928141 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
8928142 only a small percentage of americans are truly prepared to face a disaster
8928143 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
8928144 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
8928145 candidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8928146 there are not many papers that go right to the core of some of the assumptions of democratic theory the way this one does
8928147 c andidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8928148 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
8928149 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8928150 the way to influence behavior like that is to first raise peoples level of consciousness
8928151 we know were not perfect but were always striving to do the best for the environment
8928152 there is currently no company policy about opening or closing doors but we acknowledge the need to minimize energy use and are investigating different strategies such as using air fans which would prevent the cold air from leaving the building even with the door open
8928153 i would say something about it we are the customers and so i think they would value hearing from us
8928154 i would probably go in and say were all trying to conserve energy pasadena is a very green city so it would be best if you didnt pour your air conditioning into the outside world and i might say that im not inclined to shop in a place that hasnt caught on to the green spirit of pasadena
8928155 there are the hard core more conservative ones who will vote for him but hold their nose
8928156 a body immersed in a liquid is buoyed upward by a force equal to the weight of the water it displaces
8928157 it was definitely the longest speech ive seen him do and he did pull on a lot of heart strings
8928158 i would have liked to seen it more fact based but hes definitely leadership material
8928159 im a bit of an environmentalist so i really enjoy his movies and lectures he is a tad full of himself though
8928160 i really enjoyed governor schweitzer of montanas speech because he seems very down to earth
8928161 i really enjoyed hillarys speech as well talking about how her campaign and baracks campaign are about helping others it was really classy
8928162 he got over his personal conflicts with obama and stepped up and did what was right for the party and the country in typical bill clinton fashion
8928163 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
8928164 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
8928165 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
8928166 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
8928167 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8928168 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
8928169 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
8928170 im leaning obama but im still mad its a childish mad but there it is
8928171 i wasnt going to let my disappointment stand in the way of being at what is an historic event
8928172 this election is actually not close at all among younger voters
8928173 we came late so we wouldnt have a line and we havent had a line yet
8928174 weve been a band for 10 years and this is probably the coolest thing weve ever done
8928175 if god doesnt live in colorado at least thats where he spends most of his time
8928176 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8928177 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8928178 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8928179 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope
8928180 i went on a trip to europe with my father and mother
8928181 and everywhere we went we were met by vast crowds of people hundreds of thousands of people who came out into the street because they wanted to be near to an american politician and it wasnt because his brother had been martyred three years before
8928182 our nation was the most loved nation on the face of the earth because we were regarded as an exemplary nation
8928183 it took 230 years of discipline restraint and visionary leadership by republican and democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of love and adoration for the united states for the past seven years through monumental arrogance and incompetence we have drained those reservoirs dry anyone who thinks its good for our country when hezbollah is more popular in the middle east than the us has their head in an oil well
8928184 his life has been the 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8928185 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8928186 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8928187 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8928188 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8928189 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
8928190 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
8928191 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
8928192 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8928193 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
8928194 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
8928195 full of meaning and full of opportunity and if you as i believe and i know a lot of you do we did not lose the last election nor did al gore lose his last election we won it
8928196 ill screw around on my sick wife and make her lie in front of the cameras about it
8928197 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8928198 barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbit ran for president and he lost for this next election thats one arizona political tradition id like to see continue
8928199 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8928200 i will always call him governor bush because thats the last political office he was legitimately elected to
8928201 and it is now under investion they were fixed computors
8928202 there are too many republican robber barons in this nation and they exist and survive vy the use of the worst deceptive practices and tactics paying out to those whod sell their souls to put their republican puppet in the white house to enrich themselves and destroy america and its middle class and its working population these robber barons need to be crushed to a pulp to save america and its leadership in the world
8928203 fewer believe that those provided the margin of victory or that kerry was robbed of victory the way democrats think gore was robbed
8928204 it seemed to me that the clintons did what they needed to do
8928205 but it does also seem like the last two days were more about them than him
8928206 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8928207 they were able to make obama more acceptable and to restore some measure of party unity but they never defined john mccain in terms that will help them in the fall
8928208 i think mccain was able to thanks to the clintons successfully not be the pinata this week
8928209 sen mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear well not this year not this time
8928210 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8928211 i woke up in the morning and said was that a dream
8928212 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
8928213 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
8928214 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
8928215 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
8928216 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
8928217 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
8928218 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
8928219 coaching hei t dir die leiter raufhelfen pers nlich sozial methodisch und fachlich
8928220 this country needs someone with his intelligence honesty and values
8928221 i feel strongly that this country needs to change direction
8928222 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8928223 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8928224 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8928225 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
8928226 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8928227 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8928228 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8928229 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8928230 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
8928231 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8928232 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8928233 think of it this way the people having the most kids today are uneducated and poor so within a few years we will have a pretty dumb country
8928234 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8928235 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8928236 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8928237 i wish i had know this before we had three
8928238 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8928239 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8928240 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8928241 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8928242 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8928243 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8928244 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8928245 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8928246 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8928247 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8928248 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8928249 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8928250 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8928251 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8928252 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8928253 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
8928254 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8928255 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8928256 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
8928257 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8928258 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8928259 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
8928260 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8928261 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8928262 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8928263 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8928264 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8928265 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8928266 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8928267 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8928268 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8928269 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8928270 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8928271 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8928272 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8928273 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8928274 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
8928275 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8928276 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8928277 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
8928278 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
8928279 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8928280 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8928281 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8928282 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
8928283 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8928284 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8928285 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8928286 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
8928287 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8928288 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8928289 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8928290 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8928291 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8928292 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8928293 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
8928294 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
8928295 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
8928296 john mccain will pay hundreds of dollars for his own shoes but were the ones who have to pay for his flip flops
8928297 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8928298 and democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8928299 what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8928300 the idea that were responsible for ourselves but we also rise and fall as a nation
8928301 ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8928302 he took the last 8 years of the bush administration and said enough
8928303 i thought it was riveting i thought it was stunning he really did a fine job
8928304 he did everything he was supposed to do it was really inspiring

8928315 no no jimmy stewart for governor ronald reagan for best friend
8928316 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8928317 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8928318 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8928319 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8928320 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8928321 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace who yearn for a better future
8928322 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to walk into the future
8928323 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8928324 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8928325 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8928326 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8928327 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8928328 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8928329 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8928330 the number of problems both at home and abroad are more significant and i think the desire for a change new leadership and a new vision is needed now more than ever
8928331 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
8928332 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
8928333 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
8928334 the next six months are going to tell the story
8928335 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8928336 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8928337 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8928338 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8928339 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8928340 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8928341 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8928342 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8928343 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8928344 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8928345 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8928346 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8928347 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8928348 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8928349 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8928350 if our actions are determined by prior events then do we have a choice about anything or any responsibility for what we do
8928351 you your joys and your sorrows your memories and your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons
8928352 although we appear to have free will in fact our choices have already been predetermined for us and we cannot change that
8928353 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8928354 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8928355 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8928356 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8928357 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8928358 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8928359 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8928360 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8928361 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8928362 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8928363 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8928364 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8928365 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8928366 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8928367 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8928368 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8928369 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8928370 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8928371 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8928372 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing

8928379 viele unternehmen dieser region sind derzeit ausgesprochen niedrig bewertet und bieten zudem ein vergleichsweise hohes wachstum dividendenrenditen von acht bis zehn prozent pro jahr und hohe nettofinanzverm gen sind keine seltenheit
8928380 die staaten in der asiatisch pazifischen region befinden sich in einer g nstigeren situation
8928381 das geringe haushaltsdefizit vieler asiatischer l nder erlaubt es ihnen im falle eines geringeren wirtschaftswachstums fiskalpolitisch einzugreifen

8928385 he is not a perfect candidate but once again proved that he can in the face of daunting expectations deliver a simply breathtaking speech at an absolutely pivotal moment masterful performance to match a brilliantly written speech conversational at times lofty at others and studiously serious throughout in an apparent attempt to demonstrate that he possesses the demeanor of a plausible president superhumanly poised he exhibited no jitters never rushed and married his own cadence to the rhythms of the audiences reaction hitting bush and mccain like a pro he damned with faint praise mocked with humor and emphasized issues on which the republicans are vulnerable in the process obama appeared to achieve every goal the pundits and political backseat drivers had set out for him in advance he showed his heart emphasized the economy and most of all looked like a president worlds better than the revelatory 2004 convention speech that set him on the course to the nomination
8928386 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past for part of what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose and thats what we have to restore we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in a hospital and to live lives free of discrimination you know passions may fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers but this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8928387 the real problem lies in the assumption still widespread on both the left and the right that obama is a doctrinaire liberal whose positions can be deduced simply by asking what the left thinks
8928388 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8928389 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8928390 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8928391 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8928392 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8928393 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8928394 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8928395 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8928396 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8928397 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8928398 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8928399 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8928400 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8928401 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8928402 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8928403 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8928404 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8928405 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8928406 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8928407 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8928408 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8928409 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8928410 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8928411 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8928412 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
8928413 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
8928414 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
8928415 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8928416 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8928417 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8928418 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8928419 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8928420 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8928421 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8928422 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8928423 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8928424 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8928425 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8928426 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8928427 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8928428 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color

8928438 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
8928439 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
8928440 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8928441 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8928442 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

8928471 if you win most of your getaway day games youll be in the hunt
8928472 it was something i emphasized to the team during spring training
8928473 winning on the last day sometimes prevents sweeps sometimes puts you in a sweep position but most of the time it determines whether you win or lose a series because most series are three games
8928474 its the toughest game to play especially the last game of a trip
8928475 guys think about going home after being on the road a long time 10 days this time i guess what you have to do is pretend youre not going home or not going to the next city
8928476 i reminded some of the guys today that even though it was getaway day they needed to bear down
8928477 if you win the majority of your getaway days i guarantee you youd be in the hunt
8928478 aaron threw a great game other than three solo home runs
8928479 we have to show more offense than that quintero hits his second home run both against us
8928480 were getting good pitching now and we just have to figure out a way to get some more base hits they had 17 hits in three games in houston
8928481 we have to remain alert on the bases and alert period
8928482 we have to increase intensity and increase alertness we told them before the game this guy quintero likes to throw over our coaches try to prepare em as best as possible
8928483 you have to always know where the ball is this is part of the learning process we must continue to teach some of these things you figure the guys know already especially if youve already warned them
8928484 it is so basic and so fundamental keep your head up and be alert at all times
8928485 i was lazy and lackadaisical i just didnt anticipate a throw the way the game turned out one run defeat made it a big big play

8928488 i dont know about robinho because it is not my job to enter into talks about players i said something to peter a month ago and they tried to bring robinho here but my job is on the pitch
8928489 if they can bring him here it will be down to board meetings and i have to think about tottenham not about whether players have come or have not come
8928490 i dont know anything because i have not spoken to peter for the last two days
8928491 he is a very good player but it is not only me that wants him all the coaches in the world do too
8928492 but at the moment what is happening on the pitch is the only important thing for me for my players to play well against tottenham is what matters
8928493 we have made stephane understand that he will be staying at rennes and he understood it

8928500 but i am confident he will play an important part in the season but at the moment he is away he is a top class player
8928501 they were countrymen and alcoholics who loved football in a way that has gone out of fashion certainly at the higher level of the game they thought it fun they knew how to lose and by favourable comparison with many of their current counterparts were no fools early in bobby robsons period as manager the supporters were restless the cobbold response was typical robson was given a 10 year contract which enabled him to build the team that eventually brought the uefa cup to suffolk
8928502 i like it anywhere as long as it is out there in the dirt
8928503 i was checking out the speed of the last pitch it said 94 but it appeared to me like it was 104
8928504 the game kind of sped up on me and thats the challenge of being up here
8928505 i have to slow it down once you learn how to do that youll have your feet on the ground and be rolling
8928506 i tend to put a lot of pressure on myself
8928507 im appreciative for the shot at this and i have to take it just like any other baseball game
8928508 just a day off to let edwin get together his thoughts
8928509 i dont go into games thinking about my record against them
8928510 i just try to remember what i did to them in games past and how i got different guys out i try to stick with a game plan and execute it until they adjust and then i try to do something else

8928512 we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
8928513 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
8928514 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past for part of what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose and thats what we have to restore
8928515 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8928516 demand for tio2 remains strong higher raw material energy and transportation costs continue to impact our manufacturing expenditures
8928517 energy efficiency and productivity initiatives have offset some of this impact but this price increase is necessary for continued investment in global fulfillment quality offerings and value to customers

8928527 zidane un grande campione in francia un idolo per tutti ha giocato anche in italia come far io in un grande campionato
8928528 youtube forse ha esagerato un po perch ha fatto vedere solo le cose pi belle sono venuto per lavorare in una grande squadra con dei grandi giocatori e spero di poter vincere qualcosa per arrivare anche in nazionale
8928529 ci sono tutte le qualit per arrivare fino in fondo tutte le squadre di champions sono forti ci arriveremo solo con molto lavoro e applicazione sarebbe bello giocarla a roma
8928530 ci sono delle cose che non si spiegano nel calcio io ho fatto la scelta di giocare nel monaco magari non aver giocato in squadre pi importanti mi ha penalizzato continuo per la mia strada lavorando duro spero di arrivare presto al top
8928531 si vero ho avuto problemi di pubalgia mi sono fatto operare a giugno ho superato il problema ho gi giocato e mi sono sempre allenato con il monaco e un problema che ho superato

8928539 spero di segnare tanto in campionato non solo nei derby mi piacerebbe emulare un campione come marco delvecchio che ha giocato tanti anni in questo club
8928540 an incomplete story referencing apple was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27pm new york time today 27 august the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8928541 the budget deficit is hovering between 3 to 4 billion dollars the public debt at about 45 billion dollars with a 2009 forecast of 49 billion that is approximately twice our gdp gross domestic product making it the highest debt to gdp rate in the world
8928542 although 2006 started off as a promising year with 5 percent to 6 percent real gdp growth it ended with a 3 percent contraction due to the july war with israel
8928543 together the years 2005 2006 and 2007 show lower combined gdp figures than 2004 levels lebanon has been faced with three years of lost opportunities especially in light of the unprecedented riches and excess liquidity in the gulf which lebanon could have certainly tapped into
8928544 the government is forecasting a 5 percent gdp growth although in my opinion only half can be realistically expected
8928545 the doha accords however turned things around and positively enhanced lebanons economy with the restoration of political institutions and the ensuing cabinet formation which resulted in an upgrade by standard and poors and capital intelligence credit rating agencies
8928546 the return to normalcy is by itself an important factor that bodes well for improving confidence levels and reviving investment projects
8928547 privatising these industries would generate as much as 10 billion dollars in revenues for the government and bring down debt levels from 45 billion dollars to 35 billion
8928548 although no serious studies on corruption have been conducted international figures estimate it contributes to about 30 percent of government expenditure
8928549 at 6 2 percent for the first six months of the year inflation is expected to reach as much as 12 percent by the year end
8928550 and of course ensuring security and stability ultimately affects the economic environment
8928551 putting in place a new electoral law will definitely improve the economic environment and bolster investments in the long term by hopefully ensuring four years of stability

8928589 clip o the day the most talented man in showbiz
8928590 they were still doing business yesterday morning clearly knowing that this was going to happen the problem is that our money has gone into their account and we have to go through the process of trying to retrieve it
8928591 you can print out your e ticket youve got your receipt etc but unfortunately there was nobody available to speak to us from zoom
8928592 we tried for over two hours last night with the bank trying to discuss ways to stop the money going into their account but unfortunately theres nothing that they can do
8928593 we looked at various other airlines and the cost as you know has increased greatly it was just one of these super deals but you know it was just one of those things if its too good to be true then it isnt
8928594 we dont normally go with low cost airlines thats a fact but the direct flight from glasgow was the pinnacle of the selling feature
8928595 unfortunately i think id rather go with a company thats been around for a long long time and there is some assurance to passengers in this event that you would get compensation at this moment were not clear if we will be entitled to our money back as a result of the insolvency
8928596 basically they just kept people waiting and kept coming back and telling us well give you more information no final answers nothing at all until 6 oclock when basically they told us youre out of luck
8928597 were trying to find tickets at the moment but theyre all about 1 500 really really expensive
8928598 at the moment it looks like im going to be about 2 000 more in debt theres no other way i can pay for it it was all budgeted out but now its going to be very expensive its going to come out of our school accounts for food our living because as students we dont have that money available
8928599 i would love to just jump on a plane i was just talking to a lady who just threw her visa down and said get me home but we cant do that we dont have that luxury
8928600 we flew in from portugal where we live booked into the holiday inn saw a tv reporter and asked her what all the excitement was only to be told zoom went bust at 7 oclock
8928601 weve looked at alternate flights getting from glasgow to london was the problem and unless were prepared to pay about 3 000 each each way so youre talking 12 000 there was no way we could do it
8928602 so weve called it quits now were going back to portugal
8928603 i feel heartily sorry for all the passengers obviously but i also feel sorry for the boyle brothers who founded the airline they must be in a terrible state
8928604 theyve got all these people and theres little they can do as i can gather they were trying to get a rescue package until the last minute which probably accounts for why nobody knew anything
8928605 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno

8928623 the first thing our government did after independence in 1966 was to introduce free schooling anyone who gets straight as at a level can go to university anywhere in the world and have the government pay for everything
8928624 so everyones educated employment rates are high and in general that means very little poverty and very low crime what crime does exist is often committed by other islanders coming here under the new policy in the caribbean that lets anyone move anywhere as in the eu

8928651 their verdict means that you in a calm and calculated manner poured petrol over her and then deliberately set fire to her intending that she should be caused really serious injury
8928652 this was an unbelievably vicious and cruel thing to have done to another human being no matter what the motivation
8928653 sadly she could not have been more wrong because on the 23 july you made a shocking and chilling decision that would have catastrophic effects and would ruin her life forever
8928654 during the course of the day you contacted her and told her that when you got home you were going to light her up
8928655 when you got home having obviously given the matter very serious thought you set about carrying out your act of revenge
8928656 i cant sleep at night i have flashbacks of gary standing there doing absolutely nothing to help me there are days where i feel so low i want to end my own life

8928670 ling could tame this monster but perhaps 85 000 mind numbed rubes at the oddly phallic would suffice
8928671 we are certainly getting used to the demands of the national division after a baptism of fire in our first game against birmingham we were like rabbits in headlights for the first 15 to 20 minutes but in the end we did well to keep the scoreline down to 1 0
8928672 that game was a wake up call in terms of the standard of the national division and the pace that games are played at so it was pleasing when we went to watford that we gave a good account of ourselves and i felt we deserved a draw rather than a 3 2 defeat
8928673 against doncaster on tuesday night we changed out tactics and ended up losing 4 1 but we matched them in the first half and a couple of silly mistakes cost us
8928674 theres a belief through the whole squad that we are getting better and that the results will come hopefully starting on sunday against a team who like ourselves havent had the best of starts in terms of results
8928675 a lot more youngsters seem to be playing our centre of excellence is thriving and female football fans have come out of the woodwork we get bigger crowds now including a lot of youngsters from junior clubs who come along to support us

8928701 how can you come up with an inference of fraud without looking at the source documents
8928702 whatever we have is also valid because we obtained it from the eck
8928703 i suggest you looked at that final form and you didnt look at whether it was a correct representation of the 16a forms
8928704 there has been a lot of debate on fraud and this prompted our mission maybe we are differing on concepts it is difficult to apportion blame
8928705 how was there fraud where who did what i want you tell us where that fraud was committed
8928706 you say fraud rigging and everybody follows you and treats that as the truth

8928731 gathering and colluding to commit a crime against national security
8928732 we are forced to hold our meetings trainings and seminars in our homes but the security forces have worked hard to prevent us from even holding meetings in our own homes meetings have been broken up and members have been arrested nearly 50 were arrested and charged with vague security charges such as endangering national security or spreading of propaganda against the state
8928733 as south korea has evolved into a progressive democracy however the agencys vicious methods and anticommunist agenda have increasingly become an outdated national embarrassment now the reform minded administration of south korean president roh moo hyun has set about rehabilitating the agency or as some believe castrating it
8928734 we seem to have forgotten that north korea is communist and is still eager to reunify the two koreas under communism
8928735 those who struggle against unjust government forces to defend ones ideology and conscience despite refusing to accept liberal democracy can be seen as in association with the democratization movement
8928736 choi and park were north korean spies in the 1950s and sohn was a pro north guerrilla
8928737 during the conversion procedures their basic human rights were violated since the illegalness of the converting system and the law abiding oath was revealed while they were struggling to follow procedures it can be seen as a contributing to democracy
8928738 the conversion system itself was basically illegal and the freedom in ideology and conscience that is stated on the constitution is an internal freedom that cannot be forced
8928739 because they denied our countrys constitutional order and threatened our national security we cannot recognize them as pro democracy fighters even if they insisted on the abolition of antidemocratic laws while in prison
8928740 basic problems running counter to democracy and the mprovement of inter korean relations
8928741 the law has been so widely applied that its subjects not only include novels and movies but also citizens jokes during a drinking party
8928742 it served not as a law but as a chief tool to instill into citizens consciousness that thoughts that deviate from government prescribed political thinking should be punished
8928743 the purpose of this law is to restrict anti state activities which endanger national security so that the nations security and the life and liberty of the citizens can be secured
8928744 the south korean government has never said whether they have received my help or not
8928745 my reputation will be restored only if they say they received my assistance there was no comment from the rok government though the media continued to paint him as a native son and hero 25b
8928746 kim yangil the korean american who had arranged jung jaemung contact went to seoul on november 28 a high ranking ansp agent in tokyo accompanied him on a first class seat he was met by four top ansp brass at the airport and receive a vip treatment
8928747 frustrated in its attempts to obtain information on north korea including access to defectors from the souths national intelligence service
8928748 defectors have had to keep a low profile in south korea partly due to the protectiveness of south korean officials concerned with offending the north and giving ammunition to us hawks
8928749 10 000 spies but later dropped that to those he knew
8928750 after participating in u s senate hearings last year the relationship between lee and the south korean authorities grew strained since this is a complicated issue between south korea and the united states lee could not say what his reasons were exactly
8928751 its true that lee was critical of the south korean government but i dont know how he was able to enter the united states with a proper entry visa

8928802 inmates can marry noninmates there is no requirements based on gender as long as theyre outside the prison walls
8928803 but were not changing our inmate to inmate policy safety and security those are the top priorities right now
8928804 one of our main safety concerns are if prisoners found out how much money or assets another prisoner may have if they are a powerful inmate they may force the other inmate to marry them and lay claim to their property
8928805 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina

8928808 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8928809 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8928810 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8928828 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8928829 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8928830 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8928831 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
8928832 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
8928833 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8928834 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8928835 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8928836 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8928837 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8928838 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8928839 m s que una carta pastoral es un libro con toda la fundamentaci n de datos y lo importante es que es la intervenci n de una figura de iglesia con preocupaci n por la tica
8928840 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8928841 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8928842 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8928843 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8928844 p rez yoma rechaz duramente el ultim tum de agricultores de la araucan a
8928845 agricultores de temuco dieron 10 d as a p rez yoma para visitar la zona
8928846 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
8928847 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
8928848 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
8928849 todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso

8928851 se alaba que las c rceles concesionadas visit santiago 1 y rancagua est n en la primera l nea de lo que l ha visto en el continente no solamente en sudam rica
8928852 no hay en ning n caso en chile pr ctica de torturas ni en ning n caso permisividad o complacencia o hacer la vista a un lado en caso de malos tratos si es necesario son investigados y sancionados si corresponde
8928853 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8928854 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8928855 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8928856 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
8928857 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
8928858 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8928859 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8928860 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8928861 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8928862 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8928863 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
8928864 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8928865 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
8928866 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
8928867 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
8928868 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8928869 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8928870 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8928871 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8928872 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8928873 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8928874 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8928875 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8928876 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8928877 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8928878 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8928879 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8928880 chile consagra formalmente una nueva mirada sobre la discapacidad que deber a contribuir a poner al d a nuestra legislaci n y nuestras pol ticas p blicas
8928881 bachelet promulga convenci n internacional sobre derechos de los discapacitados
8928882 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8928883 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8928884 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
8928885 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
8928886 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
8928887 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8928888 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8928889 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8928890 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8928891 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8928892 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n
8928893 todos los convenios de la oit sin excepci n no admiten ninguna reserva o declaraci n interpretativa
8928894 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8928895 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8928896 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8928897 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8928898 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8928899 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8928900 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8928901 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8928902 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8928903 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8928904 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8928905 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8928906 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8928914 seeing obamas speech tonight i was reminded that a national leader can have the ability to inspire people to motivate them to do their best
8928915 i think that it was a wise choice for obama to talk about policy rather than just the soaring rhetoric of the past it went over well among christian county democrats
8928916 obama did a lot to emphasize humility which was incredibly smart
8928917 this election has never been about me its about you
8928918 i am surprised that barrack praised his grandparents who knew what hard work was but did not push that theme rather it was everything for everyone except the fat cats

8928964 ist ihnen bekannt wieviele sich personen jeweils in diesen lagern befinden
8928965 wir haben informationen und es wird weiter untersucht ob es sich bei diesen gruppen um dieselben handelt die in der zone aktiv waren m glicherweise ist es eine gr ssere gruppe die sich aufteilt und die aktionen einzeln ausf hrt der gegner liefert beste informationen
8928966 wie ich gesehen habe ist anzunehmen dass sie eine ihrem usus entsprechende planung verfolgen die wir als guerillagl ck bezeichnen k nnten
8928967 ich weiss nicht ob sie gegenw rtig solcher art sind aber unser land muss in dieser hinsicht reifen und erfahrungen des auslands einbeziehen das ist eine realit t mit der sich konfrontiert werden muss

8928972 oh yeah wise guy what about new years day you dont have to do a damned thing on new years day
8928973 the big launch is set for the end of september and there will be 30 stores in total although many are open already each store specialises in video games but they also feature blu ray music mp3 players and other electronics
8928974 in the few weeks our store has been open ive never seen anything like it one of the areas blockbuster is keen to push is our trade in offer and it is with this that we can be more competitive with the specialists supermarkets and indies the response from customers has been fantastic
8928975 dan and i have worked together for over 12 years and with an outstanding team of leaders we have built gamestop into one of the fastest growing and most successful specialty retailers worldwide
8928976 dans move into the ceo role will assure the continuity of performance that has been a gamestop hallmark his leadership drive and insight into the videogame business and its huge upside potential make him the obvious choice as ceo
8928977 these moves are a natural evolution of our growth and potential and i am excited about this opportunity
8928978 our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these employees during this very difficult time we hope yours and the community follow as well
8928979 this is a very sad day for the institute site family
8928980 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8928981 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8928982 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8928983 im confident that with an obama presidency we will have comprehensive immigration reform in the first term but its not going to be easy
8928984 an important part of the answer is not to have so many people who do not have legal status
8928985 whole detention system that is wrong and causing lots of suffering
8928986 although desirable i think it would be difficult to include fixing the detention and immigration judicial system in comprehensive immigration reform because it really wasnt a critical part of what came about last time
8928987 it doesnt mean that it shouldnt get done im just not sure if thats the best vehicle for it if the goal is to include these issues in comprehensive immigration reform then we have lots of work to do to make them front and center in this debate
8928988 we knew the senate bill was deeply flawed but we believed the legalization component for the 12 million immigrants was decent and the family reunification provisions could be fixed before the final passage
8928989 the new york times calls it a strategic misery we call it non violent cleansing
8928990 everything with our current immigration enforcement is a failure starting with ice
8928991 at 46 after working for the department of commerce and at the office of independent counsel under kenneth starr the government asked her to do this job we need to have qualified individuals to handle immigration issues
8928992 what kind of system is this when we want a sailor who served for our country to just remain in iraq because he has a conditional immigration status and is facing a 3 or 10 year ban
8928993 detainees have been denied proper healthcare and we declined due process
8928994 republicans always say that we have good laws with bad people violating these good laws and because the government cannot deport millions of people what they do is to make peoples lives miserable so they will leave on their own
8928995 the new york times calls it a strategic misery we call it non violent cleansing this is what they republicans do to try to take control of the system
8928996 its the defining issue this is the reason that senator john mccain had to change his position on comprehensive immigration reform to get the people around him and put him as the partys candidate
8928997 believe me anyone would want to take the airplane to come to this country rather than crossing the river
8928998 im confident that during the first term of barack obama we will have comprehensive immigration reform
8928999 what we need to do is to make it public
8929000 immigration reform is the only way to end the violence at the border it will solve crimes relating to human smuggling
8929001 prince william has been the catalyst for the expansion of the 287 g program across the u s
8929002 there were just a handful doing it before us the pioneering jurisdictions prince william principally among them have been the impetus for this proliferation
8929003 it coincides with the concerted effort by a well coordinated group of like minded people to put pressure on authorities to get involved in immigration enforcement
8929004 if you are an illegal immigrant you should be anxious and concerned about driving
8929005 to the extent that we have caused anxiety among the illegal community i think thats a good thing because we dont want them here in the first place
8929006 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
8929007 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
8929008 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
8929009 minority students in public schools already face barriers to success
8929010 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
8929011 he took me into the office and gave me three licks he made me hold onto the wall and he paddled me it hurt for about two hours it felt like fire under my butt
8929012 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
8929013 what made me so angry hes three years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school i was so worried that this was going to constantly be with him equating going to school with being paddled
8929014 i went into the principals office he gave me a chair and said hold onto the chair the paddle had holes in it then he just did three swats i was hit on my buttocks there were holes in the paddle to make it go faster it hurt very much there were definitely red marks and then swelling almost welt like markings it didnt last for more than a couple days it left me feeling very humiliated i think there were several levels of emotion physical pain mental humiliation and being a female at that age it was like there was this older man hitting me on the butt thats weird even at that age i knew it was inappropriate
8929015 ive heard this said at my school and at other schools this child should get less whips itll leave marks students that are dark skinned it takes more to let their skin be bruised even with all black students there is an imbalance darker skinned students get worse punishment
8929016 i see corporal punishment as a form of slavery beating on the slaves was how the headman got them to do something were focused so much on making kids do what we want think about the mental capacity that this kind of treatment leaves our children with we are telling them we dont respect them they leave that principals office and they think they dont consider me a human being that young person loses self respect

8929021 will probably have to increase its offer to the iam given whats at stake for boeing
8929022 boeing is in a position where it can increase its labor cost base revenue remains strong with large backorders
8929023 those facts plus the fact that boeing can not afford any more delays in the 787 program means the iam has the upper hand in these contract negotiations im sure the machinists dont want a strike either so my call would be for boeing to up its pay raise offer to 6 5 and 5 for a 16 pay increase

8929098 its no secret that democrats have been low on brains for a long time now
8929099 as our convention so sadly illustrates from our presumptive candidate not knowing whether he was in st louis or kansas city to his mental defective veep referring to him as barack america to our tribute to ted kennedy opening and closing with scenes of open water dear god in heaven we just arent that bright

8929109 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8929110 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8929111 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8929112 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8929113 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8929114 we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8929115 in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan i see my grandfather who signed up after pearl harbour marched in pattons army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill
8929116 in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift i think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships

8929205 the events described by the victim leave little doubt that the accused was in possession of his faculties sufficiently to understand right from wrong and to appreciate the consequences of his actions
8929206 there is every reason to believe that the accused was intoxicated on the night in question however the events described by the victim compel me to the conclusion that the accused intended to end her life
8929207 he said im here to rape you and im here to kill you
8929208 were travelling from edinburgh to ottawa via new york it was around 1 000 for the flights plus we had to pay for a night in a hotel we tried to get a flight until 11pm last night then realised wed have to come back this morning it has not been very well handled

8929210 we appreciate that airlines go bust but what i object to is that the authorities at the airport made no attempt to communicate with passengers baa would have known about this in good time and they didnt let us know
8929211 with a slight fear of being tackled by police i hopped on the highest counter i could see and shouted out the news

8929222 this news is very disappointing particularly as plans have been put in place for a number of high profile members of the gaelic community in canada to visit this years royal national mod in falkirk
8929223 it is hoped alternative arrangements can be made without too much difficulty

8929442 zu hause ist ried sehr stark sie haben eine gute mannschaft und mit lexa einen topspieler geholt
8929443 wir m ssen uns zuerst gut erholen und dann gut vorbereiten denn der sv mattersburg ist eine k rperbetont spielende mannschaft
8929444 aber man kann nie prognostizieren wie ein spiel l uft man muss sich stets alles von neuem erarbeiten l sst man locker bekommt man die rechnung pr sentiert
8929445 aber es k nnte auch die selbe elf wie gegen die georgier beginnen
8929446 wir d rfen nicht auf andere sondern m ssen auf uns schauen und uns von den mattersburgern absetzen

8929457 its a long term positive financial impact for our department
8929458 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
8929459 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world set free because neosignal means no more compromise nobody to answer to a product a brand which is theirs from start to finish autonomy time to push boundaries
8929460 funked out rolling badness from phace this track is gonna be in my box for a long while to come its the perfect combination of a deep nasty dancefloor killer timeless
8929461 in his debut release for neosignal phace delivers another top of the range 12
8929462 probably my favourite track by phace evar a very untypical phace track one might say cause its so riff driven and progresses in a more subtle and dosed way than most genre counterparts it does things ive never heard a phace tune do before and yet still its undeniably phace but the most important reason why its such a standout tune is because its got so much heart so much more than most current techy d amp b its like hearing music youve been wanting to hear for a long time leaving you wondering why arent there more tracks like this and the answer is simple because magic like this doesnt happen often
8929463 neosignals first release brings the long awaited cold champagne rollers dont come much slicker than this phace bring the phunk with style once again killer every time and sick to mix massive support from the lifted camp
8929464 cold champagne brings back the phace funk from yesteryears a resurrected cut from their earlier days gets a face lift and delivers a tight blend of old phace with the new deep driving and introspective a must for any djs box whos willing to dig deeper
8929465 this is phace doing what they do best stomping driving twisting turning appealing to that part of your brain that only phace seem to know how to get to serious for me the best part about this tune is the fantastic switch from the brilliantly unusual levitating pad solo into a relentless persuasive groove that manages to breathe as much as it kicks and so the bar is set higher once again
8929466 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world
8929467 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me
8929468 as i have said all camp i like the way our defense runs to the ball and that continued today

8929470 decir que hab a un golpe o intento de golpe es de una irresponsabilidad incre ble por parte del gobierno no es s lo mentira es tambi n irresponsable que hayan usado ese argumento porque vos sos el gobierno no pod s decir cualquier cosa
8929471 cobos lo que hizo me pareci fuerte e importante y me pareci un gesto de independencia con huevos porque el tipo es el vicepresidente no era cualquiera que estaba diciendo cualquier cosa ahora lo veo desconcertado porque el problema es despu s de hacer eso qu ten a que hacer si irse o quedarse porque quedarse congelado como est es un error si l quiere hacer pol tica pero ya sabemos ning n pol tico se va de donde est es como una definici n esencial de los pol ticos todos se agarran del sill n pero pedirle a cobos que se vaya es raro pero est s o no est s
8929472 no s si cobos puede ser un l der de la oposici n hace falta un l der de la oposici n si yo fuera pol tico tratar a de serlo no est mal que cobos tratara de serlo
8929473 yo no vote a macri para mucha gente signific una especie de decepci n se esperaba que tuviera mucha personalidad a la hora de gobernar y que no fuera tan condescendiente es un tipo que eligi aliarse de alguna manera con el gobierno no criticar casi nada cada tanto sale y dice alguna cosa pero se manej con muy bajo perfil es cierto que es dif cil estar en capital ten s a los otros en frente pero macri tendr a que haber tenido m s empuje que el que tuvo
8929474 por otro lado neutraliz a gabriela michetti que como pol tica tiene un futuro incre ble pero al estar macri con bajo perfil tampoco puede salir a hablar
8929475 en el caso de elisa carri lo digo con cari o est loca pero eso no es malo es bueno es bueno para argentina que exista lilita es buena una voz de conciencia cr tica yo preferir a que primero en lugar de querer ser presidente sea intendente o gobernadora porque me parece que le falta gesti n ejecutiva en el an lisis macro de cuando ella dice que hay un r gimen que se est cayendo yo coincido con eso hay un r gimen bipartidista hist rico radicalismo peronismo que est en crisis pero hay que ver c mo son los tiempos de eso puede tardar un a o o diez
8929476 es mentira que la deuda de aerol neas son 900 millones es mucho m s mucho m s aerol neas ya es argentina no hace falta nacionalizarla porque el estado ya tiene una parte y con la plata que puso ya en los ltimos 40 d as ya tiene una parte superior a la de marsans o sea que para equiparar su parte marsans tendr a que poner dos mil millones y es un delirio toda esta discusi n es una locura y lo m s loco de esto es que los tipos que est n nacionalizando aerol neas son los que la hicieron pelota

8929481 at the end of the day republicans were somewhat of a bit relieved because 85 of the week was focused on the clintons and thats never a bad thing it was mostly focused on a family feud and the democratic party we sort of feel like we dodged a bullet on that one

8929484 if you are asking if i had an orgasm yes it was a job sir
8929485 i didnt have pleasure doing this i was paid to do it
8929486 after i used it for three days all of my acne dried up and went away many people believe in it
8929487 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
8929488 after that my friends who work at garment factories in phnom penh advised me to apply the lubricant from number one plus condoms on my face every night
8929489 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8929490 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8929491 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8929492 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8929493 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8929494 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8929495 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8929496 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8929497 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
8929498 if something like this had happened to microsoft the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple
8929499 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8929500 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture
8929501 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8929502 venice 2008 is one of the clearest illustrations to date of the identity crisis the traditional all inclusive film festival is facing it has been clear for some time that the age of the auteur is over these days even dedicated high frequency viewers generally choose films by buzz rather than director
8929503 cinema is almost no longer cinema the type of classic contemporary cinema such as venice seemed designed to support has finally run out of steam the idea of a modern cinema that lasts 50 years is a contradiction in terms
8929504 we go look for the vitality of cinema wherever it is hidden be it in popular works or in auteur cinema it makes no difference to us
8929505 what you manage to accomplish at cannes and to a lesser extent at venice is a great junket but in venice the hotels are obscenely expensive and not very good it costs a fortune to rent interview space and the service is appalling then youve got the cost of the boats because all of the really big stars want to stay at the cipriani

8929512 recreational activities play a massive part in the life of the national park they make a huge contribution to the local economy and provide opportunities for people to enjoy a healthier lifestyle and visit the national park
8929513 but at the same time some activities can be noisy or cause damage to the landscape large numbers of visitors can also create congestion pollution and problems with parking
8929514 this will be one of the biggest surveys carried out in the peak district to find out what people are doing with their time when they come here to help us plan how to improve opportunities for all
8929515 it only takes a few minutes to fill in the questionnaire so we hope as many people as possible will take the opportunity to give us the information we need to plan services better with our partners
8929516 through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well

8929520 the kinds of conditions that he has promised labor he would try to negotiate are really non starters
8929521 in michigan you can find almost as many free traders as you can chicken hawks there are not many
8929522 a washington where decades of trade deals like nafta and china have been signed with plenty of protections for corporations and their profits but none for our environment or our workers whove seen factories shut their doors and millions of jobs disappear
8929523 the candidates obama and clinton willingness to pander on free trade and their partys growing willingness to accept the labor movements defeatist anti trade positions
8929524 the obama campaign has virtually issued an ultimatum to mexico and canada to renegotiate nafta on american terms or else it has done this presumably to pander to much needed union votes
8929525 t rade is good for the economy providing cheap imports and raising living standards
8929526 there are no serious economists or experts who believe that low wages in mexico or china or india are the fundamental reason that american factories close
8929527 u s companies pour into mexico drawn primarily by one factor low wages
8929528 the u s public is nearly unanimous in its support of requiring that both labor 93 and environmental standards 91 be included in trade agreements
8929529 john mccain is bullish on free trade the country isnt
8929530 the bangkok post has compared the democrats unfavorably with john mccain and his vision of an east asia bound together and to the united states by expanding trade ties
8929531 i am also closely aligned with president clinton president clinton is the one who signed the free trade agreement with north america
8929532 a majority of americans do not believe progressives or democrats stand for anything
8929533 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon
8929534 im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different
8929535 one of the things we do when we give out the samples is we tell people about how we get the different varieties of honey and its also just very difficult to describe the flavour of something like honey the best way is to let people taste it for themselves
8929536 our main goal here is to minimize any risk of illness we do realize that there have been a number of different outbreaks associated with this form of setting
8929537 he said we werent allowed to serve food so we decided to describe our honey as an antibacterial mouthwash he didnt seem too amused
8929538 i suspect as you consolidate outpatient services as you consolidate community based services as you consolidate addiction services then the need for admissions to hospitals gets reduced
8929539 what if that dumb bitch never got in the middle of it
8929540 vikings coach brad childress likened his dealings with culpepper to his dealings with terrell owens and said he never had a conversation with daunte that didnt involve his contract and getting more money instead of football and the team

8929548 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8929549 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
8929550 but a wins a win we would have liked to do a lot of things better defensively than we did we are in no way satisfied we have to do a lot of things better
8929551 i was trying to make a play for the team but unfortunately it didnt work out that way
8929552 it didnt happen i have to learn from this and try to make better decisions
8929553 it feels like i didnt play football in two years
8929554 it feels good to be out there i picked up where i left off now just keep it going
8929555 it will be a hard game to watch on film because of all the mistakes well learn from this
8929556 hes up in it and hes running it doesnt take him a long time to get to full speed he has those instincts you come out of the crib with ive seen him in two games and hes been darn good

8929558 diese art des sozialen wohnungsbaus galt seit den achtziger jahren als auslaufmodell

8929560 man hat viel geld ausgegeben um die sozialwohnungen abzusperren und sie sp ter abzurei en dabei h tte man die sch den mit vergleichbar berschaubaren mitteln beheben k nnen
8929561 were not going to even pretend like were bothered this has to go up
8929562 we want this issue settled and we are confident we are going to be successful
8929563 we dont want to take a chance that a case gets thrown out on a technicality we know that when we bring them down here to the hospital the evidence is going to be drawn and theres not going to be a question
8929564 the benefit is to keep people off the streets that are drinking you know and thats the benefit

8929571 russells been a huge supporter of merlin he immediately saw its potential and proved invaluable in early discussions about how to shape the series for saturday night

8929586 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
8929587 sen mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game

8929591 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have

8929611 the encode function performs a one way encoding operation that you cannot reverse it is useful for storing scrambled copies of passwords in a database it is impossible to determine the original password by examining the database however a procedure can prompt a user for a password encode it and compare the result with the stored encoded password to determine if the user supplied the correct password

8929613 i dont know about robinho because it is not my job to enter into talks about players i said something to peter a month ago and they tried to bring robinho here but my job is on the pitch

8929615 i dont know anything because i have not spoken to peter for the last two days
8929616 he is a very good player but it is not only me that wants him all the coaches in the world do too

8929628 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went
8929629 lucasarts dropped the star wars the force unleashed demo onto the xbox 360 and playstation 3 and after force pushing stormtroopers and blowing up tie fighters weve come to the conclusion that darth vader is the greatest boss ever seriously what other employer sends his protege on a mission where the only goal is to kill jedi scum and anyone that stands in his way its a sweet gig and we liked the demo so much that we played through it several times too bad its so short
8929630 in the end the demo left me with feelings of hope and dread ive been waiting a long time for this game to hit shelves and i expected it to be the greatest of all star wars games the hope comes from the fact that the demo leads me to believe this will be one of the top five games of 2008 and perhaps the best star wars game weve seen in a while the dread comes from the fact that i have a few negative opinions popping up when i was expecting this to be the game of all games from the beginning i guess well have to wait until next month to find out but im still excited about the potential
8929631 im usually hesitant about lucasarts who are known for their corner cutting and backtracking on promises usually resulting in less than average gaming experiences however theyve spared no expense when it comes to star wars the force unleashed this game is fun as hell in just my brief experience playing star wars the force unleashed i had an absolute blast being the best sith apprentice i could be

8929641 was to be an expression of gratitude for the beauty of the lake and a reenactment of the celebration of the seneca indians of early days
8929642 lit festival fires on bare hill and around the lake to give thanks for being saved from the great snake and for good hunting and fishing
8929643 up until 1880 a few senecas had still gone to bare hill where they burned sacred tobacco on a rock
8929644 to ascend the hills and to light thanksgiving fires into which they cast incense as they voiced their gratitude into the ascending smoke
8929645 lighted a great fire as if signaling from a mountain top
8929646 it was the ceremony of gratitude for the blessings of a glorious land of happiness
8929647 i put up a flare to remember that there is more to the lakes than the lakes
