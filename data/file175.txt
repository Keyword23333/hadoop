1750000 when you go to most chain restaurants ordering off the kids menu is a nightmare
1750001 right now kids meals are almost all unhealthy meals when they should be almost all healthy meals
1750002 at the very least restaurants should list calories on the menu so that parents can navigate through this minefield of calories and fat to find the healthy options
1750003 there have been a lot of changes to our restaurant menus especially childrens meals more and more options are available restaurants are offering low fat milk yogurt apples and vegetables as part of the childrens menu they are helping parents help their children make wise choices when they dine out
1750004 kids meals can be outrageously high in calories fat and sodium but its possible to go into just about any restaurant and cobble together a healthy meal for a child if the childrens menu doesnt look healthy you have to look elsewhere
1750005 eating out is no longer a special occasion its a lifestyle now so we have to be more selective about what we eat
1750006 this is a wakeup call that parents need to take advantage of restaurants healthier options especially if kids are going to be eating out three or more times a week
1750007 most kids dont clean their plates so they are probably not eating all these calories

1750040 we live in a big box big chain century but i think the youthful urban elites of the twenty first century are looking in some sense for the things jane jacobs valued whether they have heard of her or not they are drawn to the
1750041 instead of creating a new way of thinking our government used 9 11 as an excuse for another rampage of empire
1750042 our military has been used not for moral purposes but to expand economic political and military power
1750043 the vikings are going to be tough i think theyve got the elements you need to win all the question mark is with their quarterback and if
1750044 i think defensively theyre going to be better and if theyre in a game where they can just continue to run the ball and create those turnovers theyre going to be tough to beat
1750045 when you play them and you look at last years tape we say we cant let peterson dominate the game and just win the game by himself if they beat us with the throwing game then so be it but were going to make sure that he doesnt have that big game
1750046 theyre going to be pretty formidable its always fun coming back up here i havent actually played up here in minneapolis since 2001 so im looking forward to it
1750047 we missed wide receiver marvin harrison for a big part of the season
1750048 dwight freeney our pro bowl defensive end for about half the year we had other guys that were really kind of nicked up defensive back bob sanders missed some games theyve all had surgery in the offseason i think theyre going to be ready to go when we open up the regular season this year and if they are i think well be a pretty formidable team
1750049 it took my arm about id say upwards around a year and a half to get the strength fully back
1750050 i mean liriano looks like hes throwing the ball great down there now but its surgery anytime you go in there and intrude on your arm its a question mark on when youre going to be able to bounce back i probably tried to rush it back a little earlier than i should have
1750051 they usually say to rest at least three months before you even touch a ball and i was trying to get my arm ready to throw a baseball in a game in three months so probably for me it was just a little too early to start everything
1750052 but i think hes coming out of the woods it looks like from the numbers that hes putting up down there it looks like hes on the tail end of it
1750053 its baseball sometimes you do it sometimes you hit sometimes not
1750054 i know im working this is the second half of the season i feel very good and its a difficult game but you come back tomorrow and play the game again i come here early 1 30 1 40 and i work every day with hitting coach joe vavra in the cage
1750055 we talk to the guys that they cant worry about what is going on offensively all you can take care of is yourself
1750056 he has done a good job at that he has given us a chance every time out to win a game he has so much confidence going right now he keeps throwing the ball well
1750057 hes doing good i mean hes valuable because he can play everywhere
1750058 hes a great defensive player and he can get some hits and roll the balls up the middle hes a spark plug he comes to play every day and when hes healthy hes a good player
1750059 oh yeah and id match nickys glove with anybody i mean range everything hes all over the field and casilla has done a hell of a job over there but nicky youll match him anywhere defensively in the infield
1750060 hes just shortened his swing up and hes got his hands in a better position than he had them last year
1750061 hes able to get down on the ball a little bit better and stay and cover the ball
1750062 lirianos done what he needed to do to get back up here
1750063 hes our future hes our present and our future we needed to get him in the rotation and it was time to do that were going to see what this young man has if he comes back like were hoping he is and the way hes been throwing he can be a huge boost its like getting a big trade right here
1750064 i never say rebuilding because youre in the major leagues you rebuild in the minor leagues
1750065 but i knew we were going to have to do a lot of teaching of young players and hopefully we could get better as we went along you know what thats what weve done
1750066 theyve all come in here with open minds and theyve all gotten after the game thats all we try to do around here get after the game we try to teach and we try to play
1750067 theyre getting after it and theyre playing and they have no fear
1750068 thats all we care about around here no fear go out and play the game
1750069 hes been the hottest hitter in the minor leagues for us hes hitting 300 against lefties
1750070 we needed some help against some lefties here monroe struggled against lefties and we need some help against lefties and this young man has been swinging
1750071 it seems like any time we need a big hit and somebody to drive in some runs hes stepping up and clearing bases for us its awesome when you see that but we all expect that everyday
1750072 the main issue right now is with the ncaa clearinghouse and my sat scores they canceled my last scores
1750073 we should be much better i think last year we went through a growth period trying to figure out what we had here we had a bunch of new players but as much as that i think randy foye being hurt for the first half of the season really put us back i think after randy came back we were 17 21 or something like that coming down the stretch for a lot of these guys familiarity is going to make us much much better
1750074 i think fans are supporting us right now theyre showing that they want to see this new team this young team
1750075 ive seen him play a couple times and ive seen his recruiting process
1750076 you guys got a great player there a big guy that can really run the floor and can really score in transition so the gophers should be excited about that one i had a brother that played at northern state in aberdeen s d ryan miller who was a really good basketball player

1750090 this is the theatre that the company of players that shakespeare was part of first performed in and when he started writing the company would have performed his plays

1750141 was mir auff llt ist dass die schiedsrichter recht kleinlich pfeifen bei situationen die zwar hart aussehen wo aber nichts passiert pfeifen sie einfach ab
1750142 in england ist es so attraktiv f r die fans weil viel mehr in den strafr umen passiert die deutschen schiris sind da bervorsichtig wir spieler sind doch aber daf r da die leute zu unterhalten
1750143 solche vorw rfe kennen wir doch seit jahren und au erdem wie will jens lehmann das berhaupt beurteilen er war doch die letzten jahre gar nicht in deutschland
1750144 je mehr ich an das endspiel denke desto w tender werde ich das mindeste was man sagen kann ist der schiedsrichter war parteiisch
1750145 wann hat man als sportler schon einmal die gelegenheit an olympischen spielen teilzunehmen eine verletzung kommt einem nie gelegen aber dass ich gerade jetzt ausfalle ist schon extrem rgerlich
1750146 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama barack obama or john mccain
1750147 zogby had obama ahead by 10 nationally last month that has dwindled to nothing the suffolk university poll here of massachusetts voters also shows a narrowing obama lead
1750148 oh sorry we just filled our quota on that zipcode

1750150 with election day still three months away 48 percent said theyre hearing too much about the democratic candidate according to a poll released wednesday by the nonpartisan pew research center just 26 percent said the same about his republican rival john mccain at the same time nearly four in 10 said theyve been hearing too little about mccain about four times the number who said so about obama
1750151 generally accurate snapshots of how the population of interest would answer the same questions at that point
1750152 i think theres something to be said for just being able to come to work and focus on your job
1750153 tarvaris is our guy hes worked extremely hard and hes earned the respect of everybody here i think everybody has seen the work hes put in and how excited and how motivated he is and determined to succeed so hes our guy and as players we dont get caught up in all those hypotheticals
1750154 its a process it takes time and hes certainly comfortable
1750155 hes cool calm collected hes got the talent i think its just going to take time football is a team game its not just on one guys shoulders and were not asking him to go out there and win the game by himself he has to do his job just like the other 10 guys on the field have to do their jobs thats how youre successful its a team thing and success and failure as a team are part of it too
1750156 were only four days in right now but i certainly like this team
1750157 i hate to use the word potential but i like the way the team is built kind of from the inside out starting with the offensive and defensive lines and working out there a lot of things need to happen between now and september 8 when we open up the season but we certainly have the talent we just need to work hard and just keep putting this thing together
1750158 ive seen him make a couple nice plays already i certainly saw him make a bunch of nice plays for chicago over the years and thats certainly something that we need
1750159 teams are going to try to take away our running game and try to stack the line of scrimmage against us kind of what happened to us at the end of last year
1750160 i think that if you look at all the good offenses or at least all the good ones that ive been on over the years you have to be balanced you cant just be able to run the ball you cant just be able to throw the ball you have to be balanced and being balanced gives you a lot of options when youre looking at how to attack the defense
1750161 you never know everyone is one play away from this thing being over forever with an injury so you dont i certainly dont take it for granted anymore when i went through my stuff a couple years back but i feel great
1750162 i might have to study a little bit more right now but i think im caught up
1750163 but thats not to say that i dont think those are important but im not just a football player im a father im a husband and we had our fourth child this offseason so things were busy at home and thats where i needed to be
1750164 hes been with the rockets over the last nine years and was on the bench with rudy tomjanovich when rudy was their head coach there
1750165 these last couple of years before the draft we did combine workouts with houston to look at players he can really get on the floor and teach and thats going to be important for us
1750166 everyone is talking about how theyve got to make a move theyre going to make a move but were sitting here 1 1 2 games out in the al central right now with the guys weve got so no one sees the flip side when you make a move somebody is going to not be able to play
1750167 guys have really come up here and stepped up and done an outstanding job well see how second baseman alexi casilla is doing after not being able to get out there today but guys are playing the game right now so were happy with what we got and well see what they decide upstairs
1750168 youre bringing a guy like cuddyer back whos an impact player and obviously is a middle of the order guy and the defense he plays if he can come back and get healthy thats going to be a big lift for us
1750169 this club is way better than last year we were at home when we got to the playoffs so for us to have a chance right now and be coming into august here pretty soon and be a half a game out and everyone realizes were playing against some good teams and holding our own im talking about how good chicago is playing and rightfully so they put a spanking on us when we were in their park but were trying to return the favor and do that again while were here
1750170 the guy thats really having a good camp is defensive end otis grigsby the guy that we picked up from carolinas practice squad last year
1750171 he shows up every day and makes a couple plays he just needs to keep it steady he came in the first game he got here last year and had a sack if i singled out anybody id probably mention him
1750172 cant ever have enough defensive linemen those guys are at a premium so its good to see them raise up hes a million mile an hour guy
1750173 it will be a big improvement for our concerts and the timberwolves
1750174 the current situation in south ossetia is uneasy and it needs measures to lower the confrontations

1750181 it answers the profound aspirations of our two peoples it is indispensable to the construction of a fairer more sure and more harmonious world order
1750182 it is stabilised but not at all under control we dont think it will be extinguished until tomorrow

1750208 hes going to try to make it through the season he just had some problems with it with an infection so we decided to take it out before it did become problematic
1750209 but he should be ready to go probably midway through training camp and i dont think well miss a beat really we havent planned on bringing any other quarterbacks in at this point
1750210 when you have good starting pitching you are going to be in a lot of games
1750211 every year you hope your minor league system is going to contribute to the big league team
1750212 we are proud of our minor league system we are proud of our scouting we are optimistic we think this club is going to continue to play at this level
1750213 i kept telling him its not the money president wefald im not looking to leave but he kept upping the offers
1750214 i think thats part of the change in philosophy and were working very hard to get at least one bcs conference team on our schedule every year
1750215 that will mean we have to play a game at home and we have to play a game on the road we are enhancing our schedule and i think gophers fans will be appreciative we have syracuse on the road next year cal berkeley here and then after that i think its washington state for a couple of years colorado for a couple of years oregon state for a couple of years were even looking into trying to play texas and maybe ill go back at notre dame
1750216 irmen is a little bit beyond the summer development camp because hes 24 years old
1750217 but hes working out every day downstairs hes in tip top shape hes just recently married so hes very very happy in his life right now and i think hell be ready to give it a good shot to make our club in september his strength is why i call him the pit bull hes on the puck he can floor check hes smart hes tenacious hes aggressive hes got good enough hands to go right to the net with the puck he can do a lot of things for your hockey club
1750218 im just having fun and trying to win games and thats it i just try not to think about whats going on and just take it one at bat at a time and try and do something every day to help us win thats it keep it simple
1750219 well sometimes youve got to get lucky and turn on a few and then the key for me is using the whole field
1750220 if theyre throwing it away just keep hitting it to left if they start coming in turn on it and make it tough on where theyre going to pitch you
1750221 it was a little different this year going in a little more relaxed and just have fun with it
1750222 i didnt want to use that as an excuse its just one of those things and hopefully the swing can keep feeling good
1750223 hitting fourth the past couple of years and fifth before that and being in that spot the more i get up there the more comfortable i feel
1750224 you try to do less when youre younger you start trying to do more and put pressure on yourself to come through in those situations now you just relax and have confidence in the guy behind you if they dont give you anything to hit take the walk and make it easy on yourself dont try and do too much you learn as you get older that simpler is sometimes better and you just have to find that
1750225 its something that every kid playing peewee football in eden prairie like i did dreams about someday playing for the vikings so its great to be out here and be part of the team
1750226 thats certainly a career path to envy and hopefully i get a chance to have that same kind of success here i think this is a great team and a great organization hopefully i can grow and become a better player here
1750227 the evolution from the college game to the pro game of being aware of whats going on around you ratchets up even again
1750228 its a huge jump from high school to college and again from college to the pros of having to know whats going on on the entire field and not just the 5 yards around you thats definitely taking a little bit of getting used to
1750229 i knew that i probably wasnt going to get drafted but that i would have a shot as a priority free agent
1750230 so i wasnt disappointed i just wanted to get everything figured out about where i was going to be afterwards and im glad it ended up being here
1750231 i start with quarterback tarvaris jackson who has one year as a starter underneath his belt
1750232 so he understands that hes progressed in the offseason then guys like running back adrian peterson even though he had a very good rookie year he knows the drill now he knows what the grind of an nfl season is all about your offensive line plays together another year then youve added some different pieces so i just think the experience factor will be elevated
1750233 thats what training camp is going to be all about
1750234 we had limited time with those guys on the field with the otas organized team activities watching those guys play together and know each others strengths and weaknesses
1750235 well you know until you put those pads on we have a sense about them athletically well really be interested to see how they play behind their pads i think some of those guys have shown up and theres always surprises that happen
1750236 if some of those guys can surface because those are really high impact positions
1750237 youd like to have somebody surface in the offensive line that maybe you werent otherwise counting on
1750238 they showed pretty good aptitude in the springtime and theyve got a chance to be multiple position guys so once again you want to see those offensive lineman when they put their pads on and see what were really talking about
1750239 then back behind those guys i like the things that rookie center john sullivan has done from notre dame here youve got over at the left tackle were still another year for chase johnson our tackle from wyoming hes a big kid whos another year in the system marcus johnson at the right tackle hes done some decent things
1750240 i think theyre an excellent run blocking front and i think well be that much better blocking the pass this year it also is important for wide receivers and helping the quarterback get the ball out of his hands
1750241 it was real tough not just minnesota but indiana as well
1750242 it was a real tough decision to make but with minnesota a little more having my brother there
1750243 he has made great progress down in rochester and we are excited about the progress
1750244 we think he is about ready to pitch up here if we were worried about service time we would have never brought him up in april
1750245 its an agent trying to do his job liriano is doing fine and he will be a big contributor to this club in the future
1750246 his last four starts have been outstanding the first 10 or 11 starts he got a little better each time
1750247 then he had two not as good the last four he has been outstanding exactly what we hoped he would do hes starting to dominate triple a
1750248 i dont think he is as good right now as he was beforehand he is doing well in triple a we wont know until we get him back up here
1750249 i hope our starters here keep throwing those quality starts and we keep winning games our only goal here is to keep winning games
1750250 they are just asking questions the union is just doing their preliminary investigation
1750251 we are very confident in the end that they will find everything is fine and well move on
1750252 its come up before but not very often most of the time the agents let the clubs run the clubs
1750253 well move on its not a big deal im really confident we have done everything right im excited liriano is making such good progress
1750254 his best role is as a starter that doesnt mean he could not pitch in the bullpen but we think his best role is as a starter so far the starters are doing their job and the bullpen has done a very good job for us as well
1750255 i really dont have a timetable whether it might be next week it might be next month or it might be opening day
1750256 i think hes going to be up and have a chance to contribute to this club and hopefully help get us into the playoffs
1750257 the no 1 objective in this whole thing is to get him healthy for the rest of his career and not take any shortcuts to give him any short term gain we are looking for the long term career well bring him back one more time and hell have a great career for the twins
1750258 it was a cool moment i will never forget it
1750259 i wasnt really nervous at all actually the first inning is just usually the warm up pitch and then im fine but after that first inning especially it felt just like another game
1750260 i know some family came out and they were kind of on their own so minnesota was well represented for sure
1750261 thats the thing that is the most frustrating there is no timetable and nobody knows how long its going to take to heal it kind of ached for two weeks and then i took a swing against milwaukee that sent it over the edge the only thing that is keeping me sane is that we are winning
1750262 he has not done any throwing yet so we are looking forward to getting him down there
1750263 i dont know that there is any timetable on him coming back we are planning on opening day of next year anything before that would be a bonus
1750264 we are seeing signs of progress from our efforts to improve the customer experience rebuild the sprint brand and increase our profitability
1750265 hes been caught lying about his affair with rielle and their love child for many months and now the proof against him is piling up
1750266 wir gehen davon aus dass es sp testens nach den nachvermittlungen bis ende des jahres keine ausbildungsl cke mehr geben wird
1750267 we just want to celebrate hillarys accomplishments and what shes done for the country as a whole and women in particular
1750268 indeed when i come to the children of israel and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what shall i say to them
1750269 thus you shall say to the children of israel i am has sent me to you
1750270 it looks as though the jury did not fully buy the defence argument that mr hamdan was just a driver a low level employee who had no idea what was going on
1750271 on the other hand they did not fully buy the prosecutions argument that he was a central figure in the al qaeda mechanism
1750272 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict
1750273 it doesnt make sense to use this deeply flawed system
1750274 the appropriate avenue would be to use the federal court system for certain detainees and use a court martial for other detainees depending on what category the detainee falls in
1750275 consumers who are still travelling are clearly hunting for bargains and the bargain hunting is best accomplished on the internet
1750276 there is also a combination of market share gain economy of scale in that were an online operator and our costs increase at a far slower rate than turnover and our effective customer service and marketing
1750277 nevertheless we expect profit growth for 2008 09 to exceed 12 per cent
1750278 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
1750279 i think its pretty embarrassing that he would attend an event that promotes the very things that he criticizes
1750280 he should not have showed up for the endorsement of the who document
1750281 safe injecting sites are not a new intervention but simply a repackaging of existing who recommended interventions such as needle exchanges etc
1750282 they enable known who recommended harm reduction interventions to be delivered and used in a safe environment with the aim of reaching the most marginalized and vulnerable of injecting drug users
1750283 i know women who live in the downtown eastside and who are alive now because of insite
1750284 financially its more cost effective to provide prevention than treatment afterwards
1750285 as acacias licensing success grows more companies are selecting us as their partner for the licensing of their patented technologies
1750286 acacia is rapidly becoming the leader in technology licensing and we continue to grow our base of future revenues by adding new patent portfolios
1750287 full fair and open trials were not possible under the current system
1750288 a small number of people can cause a great deal of damage
1750289 immense bureaucracy whose aim is not to engage foreigners but to build a reassuring but fictitious image for domestic consumption of global admiration for their country
1750290 our party is demanding an influence on eu matters we should tell the eu and the court that we and only we control matters of immigration in denmark
1750291 attempt to try as it were id say to defuse the whole situation
1750292 ultimately habbush could not offer proof that weapons that didnt exist didnt exist
1750293 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1750294 it would be too much for my pride for them to go ahead of us
1750295 we are excited to announce this new relationship with beck aluminum
1750296 our new strategic licensing agreement will allow us to significantly increase the adoption of this outstanding alloy by increasing the availability to aluminum die casters
1750297 beck is iso certified and has support resources serving an extensive customer base
1750298 unique qualities allow beck to offer customers a product that will provide them with rugged durability and more process flexibility
1750299 were pleased that were already producing over 100 000 pounds of k alloy per month at our smelter in lebanon pa
1750300 we have already had inquiries for new programs and applications that will each require several million pounds of k alloy per year
1750301 modified viral particles with immunogenic properties and reduced lipid content
1750302 in a recent july 25 2008 issue of science anthony fauci m d ph d director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases together with leading researchers in the field of hiv prevention and research called for an overhaul in the search for an hiv vaccine recent high profile failures of vaccine trials have forced researchers to conclude that the design of a vaccine that blocks hiv infection will require enormous leaps beyond present day knowledge the validation by the uspto of the novelty of lipid sciences viral delipidation as a technique for vaccine development not only represents a new direction in hiv vaccine research but also adds important assets to lipid sciences broad base of intellectual property these patents together with the very positive results of lipid sciences pre clinical studies in siv infected non human primates should provide a compelling opportunity and rationale for lipid sciences to pursue financing to move this important program forward
1750303 the second hypothesis would be to benefit from the passage of a tropical storm to hook onto a nely wind enabling them to pick their way along downwind in some rather brisk conditions in order for this scenario to come off this storm would have to come from the philippines and work its way up towards taiwan
1750304 dejar fluir las cosas solas o participar y conseguir lo que quiero
1750305 the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc
1750306 the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
1750307 we played against him growing up i never pitched against him as far as i remember coming up
1750308 i knew who he was and never got the chance to pitch against those guys
1750309 i finally met him in 2001 and stayed in touch through the offseason and that and playing with one of his good buddies tony leseman in college kind of kept me in touch with him so its fun to talk about that sometimes we reminisce a little bit ive known him for going on seven eight years now
1750310 to have that is pretty special and theres not a whole lot of guys from minnesota in the big leagues
1750311 so to have two or even three with park center alum pat neshek on the same team is pretty neat
1750312 i guess i didnt really think about that when we were playing together and playing against each other but thats how it was going to work
1750313 i dont think i caught him i played first base and dhed a little in that all star series
1750314 it is pretty neat ever since he got here you know we are the same age and played against each other growing up and roommates in the high school game it is pretty neat
1750315 he got drafted high and i knew he was a good pitcher growing up he was one of the best around and he has turned into a good major league pitcher and hopefully he can get better
1750316 he was great the whole staff was great to hold these guys to zero runs and four all stars to start off their lineup is a great feat
1750317 i watched garnett for 10 or 11 years in minnesota this is going to be a great opportunity to learn from one of the best
1750318 while there is no overall financing mechanism in place this effort will potentially save costs of a final facility by doing the work now
1750319 we are still anticipating opening the reconstructed facility in 2012
1750320 the objective of the action by the msfc is to provide as much information as possible for policy makers the overall objective is to keep the vikings in minnesota not only through the current contract of 2011 but for the next 30 years
1750321 one we appreciate the sports commission looking at every option
1750322 we need to provide the best information to the policy makers and the public to determine the best course for a solution for the stadium issue
1750323 number two this proposal is thoughtful and impressive and reconstruction of the metrodome from what we saw today thats a viable option thats what ellerbe beckett showed
1750324 what they showed is a viable option in terms of the design and the construction where we have questions is on the cost both on the construction cost as well as the ability to generate revenue from a reconstructed metrodome so we need further study on that but the design is a viable option but we need to take a closer look at the cost
1750325 the penn relays is the oldest and largest track and field competition in the united states hosted annually since 1895 by the university of pennsylvania at franklin field in philadelphia pennsylvania it regularly attracts more than 15 000 participants from high schools colleges and track clubs throughout north america and abroad notably jamaica competing in more than 300 events over five days historically the event has been credited with popularizing the running of relay races it is held during the last full week of april attendance typically tops 100 000 over the final three days
1750326 its now clear that in fact he has a very strong defence to this extradition
1750327 he should now be released pending the completion of the extradition proceedings
1750328 the vancouver olympic organizing committee vanoc revealed it will not hold an international torch relay out of protest concerns
1750329 this is a silly policy thats being announced its inflexible it wont provide the funds that we need to equip our troops and provide them with the wherewithal to carry on and protect canada
1750330 we can do the math and weve done the math on our end and it doesnt work out
1750331 were going to see aircraft grounded were going to see ships that cant sail and were going to see no increase in the size of our armed forces
1750332 liberal colin kenny said canada currently spends about 18 billion per year but that number should be 35 billion
1750333 the population of somalia is facing serious food shortages and the world food program has indicated that current food stocks in somalia will be depleted by mid august
1750334 it has also been stated that if these supplies are not renewed somalia would suffer a severe famine
1750335 this re assignment will not put them at any more risk than they would have been in under their original assignment having said that pirates by their very nature are very unpredictable
1750336 i had a discussion with the secretary general of nato jaap de hoop scheffer about the potential for canada to participate suffice as to say we are part of a relatively small number of countries capable of providing this type of escort and the decision was taken then to participate
1750337 the fact somalia is struggling through civil war and never really regenerated out of the 90s means it doesnt have a navy it doesnt have a seaborne police force of any consequence that it can use to stop this piracy
1750338 in a place like somalia where food is so scarce food becomes a source of power he who maintains power over the food supply maintains power period
1750339 for the third olympics in a row ill be watching the ceremony whitfield said last week
1750340 weve organized at the bike shop to order some chinese food and watch the opening ceremonies
1750341 every games there are teams and athletes who decide not to walk for many reasons that we respect she said following wednesdays flag raising at the athletes village
1750342 its a long day its tiring its going to be hot and humid of course were here to perform thats our main goal to make sure athletes compete
1750343 you cant expect people to go for a two hour walk and stand up for hours after that the day before or even three days before their competition said van koeverden
1750344 these athletes are competing all the time not just every four years and its a really big stretch on their routines to do something like that
1750345 for people that have races the next day its a no brainer said canadian rower kyle hamilton whose mens eight will race in the heats on sunday
1750346 there is no way we want to do that the buzz we want to create is on the podium whatever it takes to do that we want to do i dont begrudge anyone who decides not to go to the opening ceremony its way close and way to late its not worth it for us
1750347 i love opening ceremonies so i would go now if i was competing the next day i would do the march in but maybe not stay for the whole thing its a hard decision i think for some people its not good for them for me i love it
1750348 we knew it a long time ago so we could sort of deal with it then we get to go to the closing ceremonies instead
1750349 we are quite optimistic about the weather on that day we have help from god zhang heping director of the organizing committees opening and closing ceremonies department said during a news conference wednesday
1750350 the athletes village in beijing is nice but its like living in a shopping mall there are thousands of people there he said
1750351 here in singapore we have exclusive rights to the track were in a very nice hotel its a nice clean environment
1750352 yes if its someones first olympics and they want to march in the opening ceremonies i feel bad for them he said
1750353 but all our athletes know theyre here to compete and compete well the opening ceremonies have no significance in an athletes life except a personal one
1750354 either non existent or burdensome while showing positive depictions of extra marital or adulterous sexual relationships with alarming frequency
1750355 these study results suggest that many in hollywood are actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently showing it in a negative manner
1750356 throughout much of the history of broadcast television the networks adhered to a voluntary code of conduct which stipulated that respect should be maintained for the sanctity of marriage and the value of the home our report finds that not only are the boundaries no longer respected they have been obliterated
1750357 theres the expectation that television is some reflection of reality reality television isnt even a reflection of reality
1750358 have these people been living in a cave i mean pre marital sex extra martial sex its not like this is new to television its been around for a while
1750359 the thing i find encouraging is a lot of these shows are going beyond that and reinforcing non traditional families with single parents or same sex parents
1750360 broadcasters knowing televisions ability to influence behavior must exercise greater responsibility when handling sexual situations during primetime hours opting for less graphic visual content and favoring storylines that dont celebrate promiscuity glamorize criminality or denigrate monogamy
1750361 orders and money to mullah rahmatullah a taliban militant in the region
1750362 guerrilla attacks and some other terror activities the statement said
1750363 after the arrest mullah rahmatullah confessed to his crimes and said he received orders and money for all terror activities and for the kidnappings from one of the members of pakistans consulate in kandahar the statement said
1750364 several militants and detained two others while searching the compound of a militant commander in the northern kapisa province on tuesday
1750365 several armed militants engaged the force who responded with small arms fire killing the militants another coalition statement said
1750366 barricade type prepared fighting positions inside the compound it said
1750367 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1750368 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1750369 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1750370 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1750371 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1750372 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow
1750373 we can only hope that the u s president elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority
1750374 its got a massive energy efficiency and renewable program and that much of the low carbon technology of the 21st century is being researched built and rolled out in china
1750375 if chinas citizens emitted as much co2 as americas chinas total emissions would be roughly equivalent to those of the entire planet today
1750376 at the g8 if the facts had been in front of the leaders prime minister harper would not have been able to make the statements that he made
1750377 when china sees a genuine commitment from the developed world to reduce developed world emissions and some sort of preparedness to help in technology transfer for the developing world then they will go further
1750378 but the starting point in the west shouldnt be that chinas doing nothing because its spectacularly inaccurate
1750379 this is the danger of these private arrangements if its on consent theres very little investigation
1750380 probably the worst thing ive seen in 20 years of policing the worst
1750381 there are obviously very strict standards to become a foster parent
1750382 ig was going off and the montreal people were pumped up
1750383 it had the different characters that are on the olympic website
1750384 it had every sporting event possible every time a timetable a map everything it looked totally legitimate
1750385 our suppliers have not been able to honour their commitments to us in supplying tickets for the summer olympics despite having received written assurances from these suppliers we are given to understand that they have placed themselves in to bankruptcy despite having been paid in full by our company
1750386 my initial reaction was fear anger i said lots of very ugly words
1750387 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1750388 the cirque is not sold and i am still the captain of the boat
1750389 i dont know why youre thinking im selling cirque du soleil to the world im not selling cirque du soleil im giving up 20 per cent of the company
1750390 cirque du soleil represents the ideal platform for istithmar world to fuse its strong investment network into a highly focused and dynamic institution with tremendous scope for growth across markets
1750391 i would not do a transaction like that if i did not believe it will have a beneficial result for the community that i have been living in
1750392 it was a time of awareness and women fighting for specific causes that meant a lot to us
1750393 as far as my part i wrote a lot of songs
1750394 i was there to learn about the rights of women and the rights of men and what we should do together to better the world
1750395 i dont know how else to take it all i can do is laugh
1750396 i was surprised to see rita macneils name mainly because i didnt know that she had been involved in feminist groups in the early 80s
1750397 they were being spied on because at the time they were perceived to be very radical
1750398 when you look at canadian society the way it has changed over the last 40 years it has changed dramatically especially when it comes to gender relations and these womens groups are largely responsible for that
1750399 the police didnt perceive that this change was coming about because they werent looking in that direction basically

1750408 lennesimo sostegno ai costruttori nostrani che per effetto della crisi vedono crollate le compravendite
1750409 si tolgono 550 milioni di euro destinati nel 2007 allemergenza abitativa ed in particolare alle famiglie disagiate sottoposte a sfratto per destinarli ad un fondo nazionale che dovr finanziare un piano casa tutto da definire entro sei mesi che dovr successivamente essere attuato dalle regioni e dai comuni

1750411 o il ministro nella fretta non si accorto che nel testo scomparsa la parola locazione da quello che dovr essere il futuro piano casa continua paollotta oppure non conosce le esperienze europee di social housing che sono in larghissima parte per laffitto e non per la propriet nella realt dei fatti e non delle dichiarazioni conclude il sunia vengono tolti i fondi da quella che invece era una prima concreta risposta allemergenza abitativa fatta non solo di soldi ripartiti fra le regioni
1750412 its like going shopping with a friend versus going alone
1750413 you get to bounce ideas off of each other and get new ideas its the kind of discovery that comes from shopping in a group that makes the site work

1750437 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1750438 thats a debate im happy to have because senator mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists and its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists

1750446 youre always going to be worried that in that first meeting theyre going to be like ok its kate hudson and matthew mcconaughey on a desert island hunting for pirate treasure but its not going to go that way
1750447 my expectation at this time from everything that ive heard is that it will very much honour the dramatic and thematic elements of the game they certainly understand the material and are able to provide a stamp of their own
1750448 its hard just in the fact its a movie you have to walk that line between the fact that its a property you love and honouring that property and realising its a game weve sat down a couple of times and had conversations and weve talked with john whos working on stuff
1750449 there was a lot of interest early on and at some points it became so intense that i thought it may at least get optioned
1750450 the movie industrys strange a lot of things get optioned in the movie industry you can option very cheaply and so it really came down to what take two did strauss
1750451 they did a really good deal not in terms of the financials but in terms of the people he chose to work with and how its going to impact on the franchise there are a lot of smart people involved
1750452 as long as we recognize the power within us we will continue to have choices and we will continue to lead

1750456 if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one

1750465 ralston i guess what the american people want to know though senator is what is the real difference between you and john mccain you are running this ad tying him to the industry saying that he has taken all of these contributions but as you well know there is a story out today about how you supported the dick cheney bill and he opposed it that bill gave subsidies to the oil and gas companies john mccain opposed the bill saying those are tax breaks for those companies barack obama favored it

1750472 can retailers have a happy christmas during the credit crunch
1750473 high street retailers overtook their online only counterparts for the first time during december 2006 but quickly fell behind again for most of 2007
1750474 however when the high street overtook again last christmas the gap was even greater than before and during 2008 the online only retailers only managed to edge ahead during february given the 2 6 year on year decline in actual physical visits to retailers reported by experian footfall for july it looks like high street retailers will be more reliant than ever on their online operations this christmas
1750475 can retailers have a happy christmas during the credit crunch
1750476 the growth of the online fashion industry has been one of the main contributors to the increasing market share of high street retailers online
1750477 however there are exceptions to the rule asos was the second most visited website in our shopping and classifieds apparel and accessories category in july 2008 uk internet traffic to online only fashion retailers has more than doubled over the last 12 months
1750478 can retailers have a happy christmas during the credit crunch
1750479 this is precisely the solution that marketers have needed all along they now have complete online insight into customer interactions everything from a mouse move to an incomplete form rather than just page hit levels of information with an extremely simple deployment process
1750480 by instrumenting the site at the network level using standard network products to insert the dynamic collection code into each page speed trap can now gather absolutely every interaction between the user and the site or application in order to create a detailed customer focused session based record that is ideal for real time crm personalisation customer experience and business process monitoring applications in short we deliver the ultimate view of everything they did everything they saw and everything that happened to each user of the site or application
1750481 tagging in any form is vastly inferior to style of session based tracking it is not only a time consuming process but it is also impossible to say for certain which parts of the site are the best to tag subsequent changes are often difficult to make and the process is so long that its easy to slip into a situation where you have to maintain a legacy system packet sniffingis equally inefficient it provides an incomplete picture with data that is very hard to analyse with no visibility of most of the interaction using packet sniffer applications to do more than basic error detection of customer insight is only a few steps removed from trawling through server logs session based tracking really is the only reliable way to understand your customer
1750482 tagging falls down mainly from a logistical point of view it simply takes too long and costs too much to do even if the time issue can be ameliorated through tag automation you still only recover basic page level data so there is still the massive unspoken problem of how does a marketer know what additional data he wants to tag for
1750483 deciding what elements of the site are to be tagged is not so much a science as a stab in the dark and no tagging solution combats this fault if the wrong objects forms or clicks are monitored huge underlying site problems remain undetected and when bad things happen the users have to go back and tag some more to try to get the data they need in reality this means spending more time and money with the it department and then waiting for the tags to be deployed and the data to arrive with speed trap all that data is already available for instant analysis

1750496 i think that thats the truest and best way to describe it especially since it happened very late in my life i feel like i have a pretty reasonable perspective on it with the internet with the press its all like some big bathroom wall anyones free to write anything they want about you and you have to be comfortable with that

1750499 but my research shows that there is a deterrent effect
1750500 the evidence on whether it has a significant deterrent effect seems sufficiently plausible that the moral issue becomes a difficult one
1750501 i did shift from being against the death penalty to thinking that if it has a significant deterrent effect its probably justified
1750502 the recent evidence of a deterrent effect from capital punishment seems impressive especially in light of its apparent power and unanimity
1750503 those who object to capital punishment and who do so in the name of protecting life must come to terms with the possibility that the failure to inflict capital punishment will fail to protect life
1750504 so heinous so beyond the pale that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment
1750505 one other memory i hold dear is running high up in boulder colorado with yuko arimori the japanese silver medalist in the marathon at the barcelona olympics this was just some light jogging but still coming from japan and running all of a sudden at a height of ten thousand feet was very tough my lungs screamed and i felt dizzy and terribly thirsty miss arimori gave me a cool look and just said is something the matter mr murakami i learned how rigorous the world of professional runners is though i should add that shes a very kind person by the third day though my body had gotten used to the thin atmosphere and i could enjoy the crisp air of the rockies

1750512 according to carmack the royalty fees to include a third disc in the xbox 360 version would be so high that it simply isnt a feasible solution with the programmer hoping for microsoft to make a concession he stressed that the issue is merely a storage problem and has nothing to do with the power of the xbox 360 hardware while adding that the playstation 3s blu ray format is sonys one leg up on the competition

1750548 its one thing for house speaker nancy pelosi to not allow a vote on more energy production its another to not even allow people to speak about it you can turn off the lights but you cannot silence the will of the american people
1750549 i really believe that the reason why the democratic leadership has not brought the american energy act or a compromise bill like that to the floor is because it would pass
1750550 what exactly has the democrat controlled house done for us lately well it authorized the fda to regulate tobacco it apologized for slavery and jim crow laws and lets not forget the house transportation committee moved to ban in flight cell phone use

1750572 he made a very brave stand a resolute stand in which he decided that he wasnt going to blab everything to the press
1750573 and in the meantime while he kept it quiet he was buying time from the terrorists to get all that stuff out of the country so thats what was done he just very quietly kept his mouth shut

1750598 its a long day its tiring its going to be hot and humid of course were here to perform thats our main goal to make sure athletes compete
1750599 you cant expect people to go for a two hour walk and stand up for hours after that the day before or even three days before their competition said van koeverden
1750600 these athletes are competing all the time not just every four years and its a really big stretch on their routines to do something like that
1750601 for people that have races the next day its a no brainer said canadian rower kyle hamilton whose mens eight will race in the heats on sunday
1750602 there is no way we want to do that the buzz we want to create is on the podium whatever it takes to do that we want to do i dont begrudge anyone who decides not to go to the opening ceremony its way close and way to late its not worth it for us
1750603 i love opening ceremonies so i would go now if i was competing the next day i would do the march in but maybe not stay for the whole thing its a hard decision i think for some people its not good for them for me i love it
1750604 we knew it a long time ago so we could sort of deal with it then we get to go to the closing ceremonies instead
1750605 we are quite optimistic about the weather on that day we have help from god zhang heping director of the organizing committees opening and closing ceremonies department said during a news conference wednesday
1750606 the athletes village in beijing is nice but its like living in a shopping mall there are thousands of people there he said
1750607 here in singapore we have exclusive rights to the track were in a very nice hotel its a nice clean environment
1750608 yes if its someones first olympics and they want to march in the opening ceremonies i feel bad for them he said
1750609 but all our athletes know theyre here to compete and compete well the opening ceremonies have no significance in an athletes life except a personal one
1750610 la parte israel liberar a presos palestinos hacia finales de agosto como gesto de buena voluntad
1750611 siempre hay que sonre r y poner buena cara aunque no te apetezca
1750612 lo ocurrido en la c rcel de palma es abominable y me siento responsable
1750613 algunos pol ticos creen que atacando a mi familia obtendr n beneficios
1750614 this is a silly policy thats being announced its inflexible it wont provide the funds that we need to equip our troops and provide them with the wherewithal to carry on and protect canada
1750615 we can do the math and weve done the math on our end and it doesnt work out
1750616 were going to see aircraft grounded were going to see ships that cant sail and were going to see no increase in the size of our armed forces
1750617 liberal colin kenny said canada currently spends about 18 billion per year but that number should be 35 billion
1750618 continued pressure on the media businesses as well as the recent sale of assets and outsourcing of operations
1750619 traditional media are facing a secular shift as a result of changes in consumer behavior and the migration of advertisers to new platforms
1750620 this has created a challenging environment for our print and tv businesses which has been compounded by the current macro economic climate
1750621 our goal is to use our digital platforms to drive traffic and as part of this effort we will be launching a redesigned in late 2008 the new site will strengthen ties with our print and television content assets as well as enhance the advertising environment
1750622 new technology to streamline the process and ultimately cut costs
1750623 online and e media only web site enhancements e newsletter software upgrades etc
1750624 post mortem examinations have been conducted which have confirmed that ben and catherine mullany died as a result of gunshot injuries to the head
1750625 any evidence or relevant information obtained in the uk will be passed through to the investigation team in antigua
1750626 we dont think she has a bearing on our investigation so we are not concentrating on that at the moment we have more important leads to focus on
1750627 we think this bridge is so important to the city and the sooner its put back into service the better it will be
1750628 obviously i would like to be looking at the ryder cup it would be nice for visitors to come to the city centre and look at the transporter bridge but i honestly cant say
1750629 i will be seeking the assurance of the engineers before i make any recommendation that it will give us another 20 years before anything needs to be done again
1750630 were going to need the help of everybody were going to be relying on a lot of grant contributions
1750631 we will be applying to every possible source we can
1750632 they dont seem to realise the importance of our bridge its one of eight remaining in the world
1750633 we still get visitors from all over the world and weve got 550 members from all over the world who just love our bridge and are asking when its going to be open again
1750634 weve had to cancel visits because if people cant ride on the gondola which carries cars and pedestrians across the river theyre not interested in coming
1750635 were losing visitors and its just not good enough really
1750636 this is a hamlet of quicksilver intelligence mimetic vigour and wild humour one of the funniest ive ever seen
1750637 i have seen bolder hamlets but few who kept me so riveted
1750638 for all the stage door excitement and box office success this is not the greatest dane
1750639 some parts of the role particularly the manlier more noble elements are underplayed mr tennant is also upstaged by a deliciously subtle turn from patrick stewart as the wicked but practical king claudius
1750640 heres the other one in science fiction when we cant express ourselves if were angry or were upset or emotional we hug and kiss a character or we shoot them or blast them in musical theatre we start singing songs
1750641 in series one we were like a young kid learning how to walk in series two we are up and running we know exactly where we are we know what were about
1750642 i am part of that crazy fan base when i was a child i watched dr who i hid behind the sofa like everybody else
1750643 i knew when i got involved what the history was when captain jack was created it was a great opportunity a great role when they told me i was getting torchwood and they were making me my own show theres the responsibility of the many many years of dr who culture that you kind of have to respect and honour
1750644 before they really got to know me a lot of people in britain thought i was canadian i only speak with a scottish accent when i am with my immediate family or when im up in glasgow
1750645 i am my product in my business i love what i do i enjoy what i do and i see my business being the different aspects of the entertainment industry
1750646 im telling you its true because a british newspaper did try to make out that i was telling a lie i am telling the story as i know it when i contacted my agent and asked them to find out why i wasnt cast my agent came back and told me i was not gay enough i was too straight
1750647 when the newspaper came out with that i had to defend myself i was a little bit angry because i wouldnt lie about something like that its just totally hysterical that a gay man was not gay enough to play the part of a gay character
1750648 wed look far more favorably at an urgent care clinic that was accredited than one that wasnt
1750649 it means an organization is taking a hard look at a variety of safety issues that should be involved in caring for someone who is acutely ill
1750650 if it is a good high quality urgent care center that can keep someone out of the emergency department who doesnt need to be there that is a good thing
1750651 one of our concerns that people cant recognize when they have an emergency or dont
1750652 a patient who says they are having indigestion and goes to an urgent care clinic may really be having a heart attack
1750653 we dont encourage patients with chest pain to go to urgent care centers but the reality is that we need to be prepared for anything that walks through our doors
1750654 research a facility first to be sure they are going to be seen by a physician and that the facility will be able to provide all of the necessary services that might be required
1750655 the jet lag is really quite appalling when you come on such a short trip
1750656 moffat the shows incoming head writer and an executive producer fell asleep at dinner twice
1750657 i had teas with nbc entertainment co chairman ben silverman a month after that
1750658 were all still friends just slagging each other off its just television
1750659 it created a tremendous buzz when it was shown in britain
1750660 saying what would happen if i press every button at once
1750661 i think creatively what russells achieved across those three shows is a coherence actually
1750662 its not something were going to start doing every week
1750663 the first reaction i think was that its a sign of failure from 13 episodes to five that doesnt have to be the case torchwood did brilliant business in the uk
1750664 no use pretending its not art house its not even authored in a way its a big massive brand a bbc brand the most important show everyones hard on everyone and im part of that process too we dont all wear slippers and velvet jackets and have chats over sherry
1750665 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
1750666 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for its a family title its an interesting intellectual puzzle about how best to place it
1750667 when the next season is available sure well be interested definitely interested
1750668 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
1750669 there was a lot of crying on the production i have to say

1750690 obviously everybody wants to have credible competent witnesses particularly when theyre expert witnesses
1750691 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
1750692 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
1750693 they shouldnt be here in the run up to the vote and afterward i dont need them
1750694 i gave my all at west ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us
1750695 now i will take my time to consider my football future
1750696 we respect freddie ljungbergs position and are pleased we could reach agreement and wish him all the best in the future
1750697 if we have everybody on board and nobody injured then ok but maybe we could do to take one more experienced player
1750698 id still like to strengthen and im confident well bring in at least two possibly three more faces
1750699 and if those players are of the quality of the likes of jonas gutierrez and danny guthrie then well take our chances
1750700 add to that all the players weve got to come back then weve got a strong quality squad with competition for places
1750701 we are monitoring things and are looking to improve all areas despite the good youngsters we have we are looking at home and abroad to see if we can find players even better than those we have here
1750702 but any players we sign must come here to play good football and not for an easy ride we want players with the right mentality as well as the necessary ability

1750708 this proposal demands an outcry not just from montanans but from people across the country

1750776 we did nothing wrong in the design of the barack obama button that mistakenly featured a photo of larry craig when our designer sat down to make this button he positioned his mouse pointer over a photo of larry larocco this particular designer uses a fairly wide pointer arrow which may have been in contact with a photo of larry craig a visual aid has been attached to illustrate our assertion that we are not at fault
1750777 let us be clear we do not stand behind larry craig we never have stood behind larry craig

1750994 its a kids dream to get to draw on the wall
1750995 if i could think of anything it would be to let the room come about organically some of the best things in maxs room or our house in general have come from a thought out of nowhere or by complete accident find something that inspires you whether its your child or a piece of art or a color scheme and run with it and never settle for full price if you have the time to hunt in store or online it is well worth it especially when it ends up covered in toddler teeth marks and crayon

1751004 but when we went live it was a different story

1751006 were proud of both companies shared goal of providing a superior mobile service in australia experts from both companies are working in partnership to resolve any remaining network issues as is always the case when any outage occurs
1751007 we have told nokia to fly out some engineers because we certainly wont be flying them here
1751008 we do have some service level guarantees with them and we will clearly be looking at whether in fact the software they have given us is up to scratch

1751060 most children who die in this country still die in pain
1751061 while adults at the end of life expect state of the art pain and symptom management thats not yet the case in pediatrics children metabolize drugs differently than adults and most children dont have access to specialists trained to provide the appropriate care
1751062 if i ever finish medical training i told myself i want to find a better way
1751063 i thought minnea what it took me five minutes to find it on the map
1751064 too many of the families who come to us have heard im so sorry but theres nothing more we can do for the pain

1751070 at yet another volatile meeting of the pcrc longtime activist spike moss shot up out of his chair and faced off with another veteran community leader ron edwards
1751071 the group was debating whether edwards and american indian activist clyde bellecourt should be ousted as co chairs
1751072 with his voice rising moss accused edwards of withholding information and not supporting the groups platform
1751073 finally he screamed youre not going to stab us in the back and be a chair
1751074 when i first saw the proposal in the potential settlement of the black officers suit i thought here we go again with another police community relations type thing
1751075 the pcrc seems to many to have become a distraction it has set up a parallel structure that interferes with the ability of the mayor and police to do their job i dont hear anyone arguing that its been a success in reducing crime
1751076 people are starting to question whether there is a civil rights solution to every issue the cure to many problems in the african american community does not just lie in more affirmative action or quotas in hiring more black police officers or teachers or in diversity training for white people african american leaders should challenge the community to take full advantage of the opportunities that do exist and should also be willing to challenge it when its members engage in inappropriate destructive behavior
1751077 enough the phony leaders dead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black america and what we can do about it
1751078 complying with a demand to pay whatever it takes to sign pedro alvarez would impair the clubs ability to execute that plan

1751117 im really looking forward to going to the glen for my first nationwide race there as its a track i have always enjoyed
1751118 the no 40 fastenal dodge has been quick all year and as a team were really looking forward to continued success throughout the rest of the season i have confidence in crew chief brad parrott and the boys that we can get it done at watkins glen particularly after a very productive and enjoyable test at road atlanta last week
1751119 were really excited to have partnered with jobtarget they will be able to give our clients the most effective job searching and targeted recruiting capabilities there is to offer
1751120 we realize how difficult it is to find quality employees as well as job opportunities in the internet marketing world these days and the new career center will help address that problem
1751121 one of the distinguishing features of our site from the general big boards is that employers can access our resume bank and browse resumes without paying a fee
1751122 six years ago we formed the outlines of the dlfa as we under took a military review of the lay of the land as it stood in both professional and collegiate football
1751123 the kentucky due diligence is ongoing right now and its not complete
1751124 i cant answer definitively whether or not we will go forward with the transaction
1751125 the market is fantastic for sports when you talk about sports fans that area is in a fever over sports the ohio valley and that area if we were able to get a cup date at that facility and to acquire it at a good price would give us a very strong facility and a great anchor in what is really more of a midwest area where we dont currently have a race and a unique area of the country for nascar that really hasnt been served
1751126 our hope is to realign a date to that facility if we were to close on that transaction and well be able to have a board discussion on that soon
1751127 isc has become the ugliest acronym on the colorado sports scene
1751128 isc should build this track with private money or release the restrictions at ppir and let us enjoy what we had
1751129 right now next year looks a lot like it did this year where we have sporadic events
1751130 so there is opportunity obviously sponsors and everybody wants to be involved with a team that can win races i look at this weekend as an opportunity of putting our team in victory lane theres only been three teams this year that have been in victory lane so if we could pull it off that would be big
1751131 i think scott riggs is a very good race car driver
1751132 am i committed to running a second car you know wed love to run a second car i think our team and our facility and our systems and procedures and policies all that stuff is in place now to run a second car
1751133 you know we still havent won with one car but this weekends race hasnt happened yet either its important to make one car run good first and weve been able to stay inside of the top 35 but you know at the same time wed like to position ourselves to win races
1751134 a second cars going to help in that because youre going to find solutions for our problems faster
1751135 i think scotts a good race car driver so thats obviously something that i would look at obviously the thing out there is whos going to pay for it how are you going to do it and what sponsors are going to be involved in it
1751136 robby gordon motorsports would love to add riggs to team in 09
1751137 we didnt do ourselves any favors at pocono especially considering the fact that we saw that race as a big opportunity
1751138 but even though we dropped some spots we were by no means safe or comfortable heading to pocono so our focus doesnt change we need to go out get good results and try to lock up a place in the chase
1751139 we still have some good tracks left for us leading into the chase so were certainly not overconfident but like the way the schedule looks given our past performances of course pocono proved that anything can happen
1751140 its something different than what we are used to and it tests the drivers and teams in some different ways
1751141 just like well go test and prepare for going to a road course i know the guys on the over the wall team have been practicing pitting the car from the right side which is something unique to the glen so a lot goes into it
1751142 its definitely a place i feel like weve got the potential to win even before we make a single lap
1751143 when a j foyt was the first to win four indy 500s that was huge to imagine all the different types of racing thats been at watkins glen and know that weve got a shot to do something that hasnt been done before is definitely a cool opportunity
1751144 driving cars with suspension and definitely driving cars that you had to shift thats something that came relatively easy to me and still comes easy to me as far as knowing how to synchronize the gears without having to use the help of the clutch
1751145 theres just something about the shifting side of it thats been really natural to me and its fun i like having a different discipline to race on i like having the opportunity to do something twice a year that we dont get a shot at doing very often i take the same amount of pride that someone like ron fellows or scott pruett does when they come into a road course race i take that same pride in running well that they do in these cars i dont look at it from the standpoint that its a negative weekend i look at it as a positive that its something we enjoy and i feel like that gives us a leg up on most of the guys we race with at these tracks
1751146 you know that when you outrun jeff that you did an excellent job
1751147 youre not going to back into a win with jeff out there add comment
1751148 why you can walk down the sidewalk of an american city carrying a concealed weapon without a license is wacky

1751177 i dont want to give it to my grandchildren to pay
1751178 i saw her on the grammy awards where she did that rehab song and i thought she was fantastic
1751179 looking at her picture shes the cutest little thing youve ever seen to be so out of control like that you know she wants to be so tough i was laughing the whole time i did the song and all the while i was praying for her
1751180 i was able to handle miss beehive because it was a reflection back on the time when i was there
1751181 i was determined to do that song even though its a novelty song i had these songs sent to me by jon for two years had em laying around i thought if i could put my vocal on it and handle these songs we could come out with something i was right
1751182 i think hes been cautious and deliberative on development issues which i admire
1751183 am i happy the money is going to charters no not at all but sometimes if youre going to help your kids you have to make a compromise here and there
1751184 its a good example of how we can do the right things for kids if we all work together
1751185 enhancing the ability of charter schools to secure adequate facilities will assist them in serving their unmet demand and at the same time will also help address the overcrowding problem this bill attempts to address
1751186 this would greatly increase the amount of funding for charter school facilities
1751187 with the state facing massive structural debt this would make it worse
1751188 id be willing to take a look at it again
1751189 when we first started we were really adamant that we wanted to work on tape and use certain gear
1751190 we were stuck in a studio in wales and the tape machine broke so we finished on pro tools and before that when we were demoing wed use whatever format we could to get things down so i think we just realized that its more about the expression youre laying down rather than the format i could see the beauty in that but if you focus too much on the tools then theres something sort of soulless in that as well
1751191 is that we hope to be a stylish band and not a fashionable band theres quite a fine line but i think people get our thing wrong weve been turned on to so many things by other bands and from reading interviews with other musicians weve been fans of talking about how they discovered the 13th floor elevators or minnie riperton or whoever it might be so ive got no problem with telling people who are into our band about the stuff that got us to where we are
1751192 i find it kind of weird when bands are blatant rip offs and act like what they do is completely original
1751193 i cant really get my head around how that works or why they would want to be like that we just played a festival in los angeles and gang of four and jesus and mary chain were playing both bands were so influential they both came up with such a distinct sound of their own if youre going to get inspired by this great thing why not take it further
1751194 without joy joy joy and the rain i could feel forever the same
1751195 but hopefully we dont have that sort of po faced attitude
1751196 i went to the movie by myself to relax for a couple of hours and just kept feeling like the phone was vibrating whats up with that
1751197 weve done surveys that show that 67 4 percent of people who carry a phone in their pocket report feeling vibrations that arent there our minds can misinterpret what we hear or sense we can make a ringing phone out of background noise or we can feel vibration of sound waves at a movie and think its a cell phone
1751198 i was twitching around like a carp in the bottom of a boat
1751199 i was grabbing my pocket every five minutes or so through the whole movie i couldnt even enjoy the show
1751200 leave the sex toy turned on so it vibrates all the time and you quickly get so you dont notice it and you can watch a movie or do anything else you want to do in peace you just have to remember not to pull it out and try to answer it
1751201 how perfect expected and fortuitous not to mention profitable that tijuana bible evolved as the go to moniker for pornographic mod texts
1751202 not that you need catchy names to move porn but anything sexual with the name tijuana attached to it assured that the consumer would be confronted with some beastly swarthy over the top sexual witnessing that would leave them ready to empty their gonadic profits onto sheets tissues sheep or worse
1751203 i mean theres always the fad and theres always the cool thing to do right now i feel like i just have to do what comes out if its not cool then im just going to have wait for a couple years i cant change it i mean i hope its cool i feel like as long as youre being honest and that theres some kind of a truth in the songs that people are going to connect to it and enjoy listening to it
1751204 i love playing acoustic but as far as options for tv placements options for actually making money on the music because i mean thats the end goal i thought i needed to put my best songs forward and i felt like these were my best songs at the time that we went into the studio
1751205 i wanted to have the band being able to put strings on i could get used to this was something i didnt want to pass up
1751206 i guess its because we all studied music so we dont come by it in the same way as garage bands
1751207 it was really a metaphor for me that those songs were leaving
1751208 every one of those songs were all written the same way about the same things like i was wrapped up in my influences rather than approach it myself with any sort of honesty or validation
1751209 i had all these things on my mind that had been unexpressed like unextracted
1751210 it was very freeing i found all this shit all this grudge and meaning in what i was singing so i was able to do all that completely unhinged
1751211 the new songs all came from different places over the last year so theyre very scattered
1751212 its gotten into a much healthier place not as healthy as it could have been but its a better its a better its a better place
1751213 it was too hard to turn around the titanic so they just threw everybody overboard without life jackets
1751214 plying my trade with a will joy in my heart my voice soaring on whiskey wings and all these good things happening around me and then a fight breaks out
1751215 like flies in a bug zapper thoughts darted all over blue genes mind and disintegrated before landing on any conclusions
1751216 this should not have been in the glare of press discussions in august 2008
1751217 as we have all known that this could be a problem ever since beijing were elected and we should have taken whatever steps necessary
1751218 numbers are a major factor in being marginalized or being recognized by decision makers in public policy

1751223 whatever i can just play really defensive and hopefully keep the melee away from me for a decent time

1751256 we want people to make sure they pay attention to what lanes they need to go into and that if they are an ez pass customer and in an express lane to make sure the pass is mounted because theyre not going to know where the read zone is

1751259 i think im going to wait until they say so and then make that decision on that day
1751260 destinations for which we advise you to reconsider your need to travel
1751261 we continue to receive a stream of credible reports indicating terrorists are in the advanced stages of planning attacks these attacks could target western or australian interests and individuals and places frequented by foreigners and could occur at any time attacks may be launched anywhere in pakistan including major cities
1751262 we want to go over and play in safety we want to make sure that were safe when were playing in any country so its not just pakistan its any country
1751263 as long as were safe and weve been guaranteed that all the security measures are right and so and so then theres no reason why we cant go
1751264 das ist nicht grau das ist silber ist grad der letzte schrei bei den gorillas ist der silberr cken auch der chef
1751265 i believe that either today or tomorrow i am not privy to his schedule sen obama will be landing in iraq with some other senators there will be a congressional delegation and i am sure that sen obama is going to arrive in baghdad in a much much safer and secure environment than the one that he would have encountered before we started the surge
1751266 well im looking forward to seeing what the situation on the ground is
1751267 i want to obviously talk to the commanders and get a sense both in afghanistan and in baghdad of you know what the most their biggest concerns are and i want to thank our troops for the heroic work that theyve been doing
1751268 im more interested in listening than doing a lot of talking and i think it is very important to recognize that im going over there as a u s senator we have one president at a time so its the presidents job to deliver those messages
1751269 as soon as possible as far as we are concerned
1751270 u s presidential candidate barack obama is right when he talks about 16 months
1751271 so far the americans have had trouble agreeing to a concrete timetable for withdrawal because they feel it would appear tantamount to an admission of defeat but that isnt the case at all if we come to an agreement it is not evidence of a defeat but of a victory of a severe blow we have inflicted on al qaida and the militias
1751272 it is certainly our intention that we reduce our troops but i am not going to set out an artificial timetable

1751274 i love obama he is the best and most intelligent future president we had in long long time
1751275 obama would not be able to go over their if it were not for the surge working
1751276 who does not know who were fighting or where were fighting responsible for the safety of billions of people
1751277 by the way how many americans were killed by guns today in america blame the violence on a democrat
1751278 as soon as possible as far as we are concerned
1751279 u s presidential candidate barack obama is right when he talks about 16 months
1751280 well im looking forward to seeing what the situation on the ground is

1751293 if you look at quite a few other clubs theyve not been able to bring in as many players as we have at this point
1751294 at this time of year everyone has expectations and people will look at the situation and make their own minds up
1751295 our job is to try and fulfil all the promise weve got in the squad because with everyone fit weve got a strong group of players
1751296 theres still some work to do but im really looking forward to the start of the season we might not do as well as we think we can but thats the fascination of a season
1751297 its a very tough league but were optimistic and at this stage the fans should be as well theres no reason why we cant have our dreams
1751298 youd have to say its harder to win when hes in the field than when hes not in the field but i dont see this as any greater opportunity than last years pga
1751299 if the pins are on top of all these hills it could be borderline impossible to shoot anywhere near par but if you have pins down the bottom of the slopes and the tees up it will be a bit more playable
1751300 this is an interesting course to attack because the birdie holes change each day based on the pin placements
1751301 you have to be patient in majors and im definitely more patient
1751302 im just accepting what happens its frustrating when you hit bad shots or miss putts but it lasts with me for 25 seconds and its done
1751303 by time i get to the next shot its no longer with me and i think thats why ive played better this year
1751304 sometimes you can want something too much and put a lot of pressure on yourself and thats what ive done in the past
1751305 a small number of early production dsm 750 wireless n hd media center extenders have an issue with a corrupted security certificate which results in the communication error messages described in this post when trying to affiliate the dsm 750 with a pc running windows media center

1751307 liquid pools of money from which any one of the core ministries can draw
1751308 ive been lucky over my career with my recuperative powers but it was one thing we wanted to make sure with the knee that it was more about longevity than anything
1751309 we didnt want to put any extra strain or pressure on it
1751310 for me it was making sure my leg was right you dont want to be going out with that hanging over your head that your bodys not right
1751311 in 2006 it wasnt much fun spending a week in hospital with golden staph
1751312 there has always been the concern about the knee but ive been able to manage it really well through the footy club the doctors physios and fitness staff so ive been lucky
1751313 at some points it causes you a fair bit of grief but youre able to push through
1751314 there was a part there where i struggled a fair bit and you go through periods where you wonder whether or not its worth putting your body through that much pain but at the end of the day weve been able to manage it well
1751315 we are delighted to have both alan and mark on board with ireland
1751316 both of them are extremely strong technical coaches in their areas and i think they will bring a further positive mix to the coaching team and squad
1751317 alan brings with him experience of both international and most importantly irish rugby
1751318 mark is recognised as one of the top kicking coaches in the world and his experience of working with the squad in the past will help with the transition over the next number of weeks
1751319 im very happy and honoured to have stretched my career out for as long as i did
1751320 its the right time for the club its the right time for myself ive had a great run
1751321 when you look at the best and fairests the brownlows its self evident how good he is
1751322 he stands equal with the greatest midfielders in the game
1751323 i think maybe sonny might not have that long in the game with the injuries he had maybe he thinks he does not have much longer in the game and needs to get out of it what he can
1751324 its getting to the point where its getting quite embarrassing
1751325 we need to show plenty of heart this week and get some pride back in the jersey because at the moment were just embarrassing ourselves and the club
1751326 you can come up with thousands of excuses about why were going bad but at the end of the day theres not one player thats going to stop us from getting 40 points put past us
1751327 once we get behind on the scoreboard the heads are just going down at the moment and the excuses come out so weve just spoken about getting rid of that and turning things around
1751328 weve been saying that every week but weve got to do it now
1751329 the support we received and the money we raised on the night was sensational
1751330 to make such significant inroads into our debt in one night has provided a fantastic start to our debt demolition campaign
1751331 on field the years been pretty ordinary and we had a few things go wrong off field as well
1751332 i think it gave us a real boost last night and the players that were there were a little bit gobsmacked i suppose at the generosity of the supporters and the passion that theyre showing
1751333 i had a really tough session on monday and got through it really well and have pulled up fine today so i think thats a good sign and the physio and the doctor are happy so ill take the field
1751334 the tigers have already said how desperate they are so i think its going to have a feel of semi final football out there
1751335 its enormous and its happening to a lot of clubs
1751336 the fact we had a fairly old list it was always going to happen at some stage its probably happened a bit earlier than we expected
1751337 its unusual but the groups got to pull together and cover those particular retirements in the short term
1751338 it affects the younger players because theyve got to fill the void in the short term
1751339 i think about a month ago i had probably come to the realisation i could no longer do this
1751340 injuries are a part of the game and theyre the things we have to overcome but at my age i wasnt prepared to overcome the hurdle again
1751341 he had that fierce desire that you look for in a player and always wanted to win
1751342 sometimes heath got overzealous with that but theyre the sort of characteristics you look for in a player
1751343 the selections on the night gave us the right options to be able to attack the new zealanders where we wanted to
1751344 unfortunately we werent accurate in the lineout play and that compromised us
1751345 its one of those things you can pick a taller lineout but irrespective of who you pick you have to be accurate in your skill
1751346 i thought the first two matches we met those physical challenges last week against new zealand we probably didnt
1751347 theres no denying it was a performance that wasnt good but i think the signs generally have been there
1751348 theres a lot of excitement about whats happening at the moment and they will be busting to get back into it to put that performance behind them
1751349 it was a little out of character and we will be doing our best to rectify that
1751350 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1751351 i just laughed i said seriously you are joking and then he has a go at anthony youre kidding yourself if you take advice off him
1751352 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1751353 who does he think he is does he think he is god is he god or something
1751354 obviously to do something like that leave i wasnt happy
1751355 i havent been happy at the bulldogs for a while
1751356 he will do anything now to try and justify this decision regardless
1751357 i was in the room last year when he agreed shook hands and signed a deal to stay with us for five years
1751358 i thought yesterday was the worst that ive seen him he looked a little bit down
1751359 he went through a big change this year mini hes got into a lot of reading about mental attitude and positive thinking and it was working
1751360 there wouldnt be many more blokes with more confidence so hopefully he can get his head back in the books and get back on track
1751361 the whole club is confident that hell play some more footy this year
1751362 i think thats the best way to approach it thats the way i felt as a player i was never that comfortable about being rested and having players rested so i think the best way is to be aggressive and give everyone a shot
1751363 he will probably play the week after so it gives him one or two games at williamstown and then maybe one or two in the seniors before the finals
1751364 under an arthroscope the bone is still a bit soft but he cant do any more damage to it so hes just got to get through that pain barrier and we know hes a very tough individual
1751365 its just a matter of getting some games into him and having that match conditioning
1751366 higgins as a younger player hes needing longer than a scott west would
1751367 you feel for him because his injuries have been anything but minor hes more than frustrated and he was very upset on the weekend but the scan and prognosis is a lot better than we thought it would be so that should give him some hope
1751368 were not resting anyone i used the wrong word i suppose a better way of putting it is we have a no risk policy
1751369 anyone we think might be at risk on the weekend wont play but we wont be resting any player just for rests sake
1751370 you dont want to lose the last four games and then all of sudden you come into finals without any form behind you
1751371 it was a tough one but we did the job
1751372 right from the kick off they pressured us and made sure we couldnt get our passing game going
1751373 when your goalkeeper is one of your best players and your other two are probably defenders michael thwaite and roddy vargas you know that you havent played your best football
1751374 but sometimes you play a game like that when youre not at your best and you come away with a win and you think not a bad team to get that sort of result with not the best performance
1751375 it has been the perfect preparation for the a league season and to get to the final which the boys set themselves the challenge of winning it sets us up really well for the a league season
1751376 i believe his best option right now is a 1aa school

1751418 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1751419 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1751420 the leadership in beijing will almost certainly find his comments irritating or objectionable
1751421 but they will clearly understand that the united states will not impose any real consequences if they do not make progress on human rights

1751432 i had a discussion with the secretary general of nato jaap de hoop scheffer about the potential for canada to participate suffice as to say we are part of a relatively small number of countries capable of providing this type of escort and the decision was taken then to participate
1751433 the fact somalia is struggling through civil war and never really regenerated out of the 90s means it doesnt have a navy it doesnt have a seaborne police force of any consequence that it can use to stop this piracy
1751434 in a place like somalia where food is so scarce food becomes a source of power he who maintains power over the food supply maintains power period

1751789 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip

1751876 y eso puede significar dado el precio fijado por el banco central europeo en sus transacciones que alcance hasta un 13 por ciento m s
1751877 pues el presupuesto de la generalitat es una cantidad cerrada y estos pagos son una obligaci n que en caso de no atenderla se ve incrementada por los procedimientos judiciales que las empresas inicien
1751878 las dificultades por las que atraviesa la generalitat son de tal magnitud que los retrasos en los pagos se van acumulando y se sabe que estos retrasos en pagar a proveedores y contratistas se est n produciendo en todas las consellerias sin excepci n

1751924 so thats why i say steve has a legit chance because he is now kicking the ball in a style and a form that can make it in this league
1751925 hes done a good job adjusting to it and his times are really good now
1751926 hes been tweaking a few things on his field goals but his kickoffs have been incredible
1751927 thats something that could definitely get a guy in the league and keep him there for a long time a guy like him could come in and really do some damage because he can hang it up there for a long time
1751928 he also went from the rigorous course work of neuroscience at a demanding academic school to enrolling in park recreation and tourism at nc state
1751929 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1751930 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1751931 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1751932 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part
1751933 i keep saying im not sure if this is true or not true im making the team and now im the first guy coming to the stadium and the whole world will be watching me carry the flag there are no words to describe it
1751934 in america everyone has a chance to do all these things
1751935 you follow the rules people will choose and if im blessed to get that opportunity ill get it
1751936 all of those were sent six years ago and unr police chief adam garcia made it clear that was unacceptable behavior and we have seen no mass e mails since
1751937 however recently one or more officers self reported that they had forwarded one or two such e mails not to the whole force but to another individual on the force
1751938 from my perspective we are not planning to do more
1751939 chief garcia has reinforced his position several times about the inappropriateness of such e mails
1751940 is comfortable the university has done what it needs to do with the scope of the issue
1751941 i realized the battle was already lost that we were deluding ourselves if we felt we could force this kid to do anything in school it was only a question of whether we were going to lose him as well
1751942 he wasnt like some belligerent sullen kid he was a great sunny guy who happened to hate high school he was ill served by going to school he likes to talk and he likes to watch movies so i thought lets give the guy something to do that gives him pleasure and see where he goes
1751943 i worried i was making use of him as an example of my own hipness
1751944 there was something that flattered my vanity about this decision to let him drop out of school and watch movies
1751945 if he hadnt done something like that he wouldnt have been my dad i think that three years we spent together formed me as a person
1751946 i dont think you necessarily learn life lessons from films i think the only life lessons you learn are from knocking yourself around and actually living but wed have conversations that sprang out of these films i did learn from that things guys need to talk about heartbreak and drugs and all that it happened to be movies but it could have been something else my dad and i did i think it was more about us spending time together

1751949 a desire to look at and learn about the stars
1751950 wonderment desire to learn more about what theyre looking at an interest to find out whats all out there instead of just white twinkly things
1751951 theyve got to ask themselves questions why are some stars brighter why are some stars different colors why do stars die out why are they born
1751952 the best way to do that is to find polaris the north star
1751953 the sky is broken up into degrees so if you want to measure how many degrees something is from the horizon you can either use a fancy instrument or you can use your fists
1751954 there are a bunch of different tools you can use your hand spread at arms length covers an angular size of about 20 degrees your fist is about 10 degrees your thumbnail is about two degrees and your pinky fingernail is about one degree
1751955 if you want to know your latitude go outside find the north star and find a way to measure how far the north star is away from the horizon thats your latitude just start stacking fists
1751956 when you look straight at something youre using the color sensitive parts of your eye
1751957 at night you start to lose the ability to see colors at night everything looks gray so we sort of switch to using the light sensitive parts of our eyes your peripheral vision is most sensitive to light and dark

1751967 los problemas relacionados con la plantilla de m dicos de urgencias del cl nico como en otros centros de nuestra comunitat valenciana no son nuevos y han sido denunciados repetidamente
1751968 incluso duplicarla con el fin de ofrecer una atenci n de calidad
1751969 mediante los incentivos que sean necesarios dada la escasez de m dicos que desean trabajar en las condiciones actuales
1751970 ni forman parte de la plantilla estructural ni su funci n es otra que la de formarse en una especialidad determinada

1752000 ya ha sido reconocido por el propio vicepresidente econ mico del gobierno central
1752001 no habr ning n problema para que incluso con esos incrementos de los tipos de inter s la administraci n de la generalitat valenciana pueda seguir manteniendo por un lado pol ticas de inversi n acudir al endeudamiento cuando sea necesario y garantizar que ese endeudamiento no sea una carga inasumible para las generaciones futuras de valencianos
1752002 salvaguardando ese equilibrio entre la carga que generaciones futuras tienen que atender y las necesidades para poder seguir manteniendo tasas de crecimiento econ mico y generaci n de empleo en el momento actual
1752003 evidentemente la generalitat valenciana como cualquier otro agente con independencia de que este sea p blico o privado
1752004 aumentan sus gastos de financiaci n porque est n aumentando tambi n los precios de esa financiaci n en el mercado y que son aplicables
1752005 principalmente motivado por ese mill n m s de valencianos que somos en la comunitat valenciana y que no tiene en cuenta nuestro modelo de financiaci n actual
1752006 todos los ejercicios supone que existen ciertas tensiones presupuestarias en cuanto a aumento del gasto corriente ligado principalmente a sanidad y educaci n
1752007 si esto no es suficiente no queda otra posibilidad que limitar algo la inversi n prevista para poder atender el aumento de las necesidades del gasto corriente principalmente en educaci n o en sanidad
1752008 es si no tienes nuevos ingresos el tener que limitar la inversi n que es justamente lo que aparece en ese informe y lo que viene sucediendo normalmente en los ltimos ejercicios por esas necesidades mayores de gasto
1752009 las condiciones meteorol gicas para navegar han sido fant sticas ha sido muy satisfactorio y una vez m s hemos aprendido muchas cosas
1752010 fue muy productiva pero estos dos ltimos d as han sido totalmente diferentes a la copa del rey unos cambios de ritmo que siempre se agradecen
1752011 est haciendo lo contrario de lo que deber a hacer en estos momentos

1752017 no ha licitado casi ninguna de las autov as comprometidas en el pie o en el protocolo de carreteras
1752018 de las 12 autov as y v as de gran capacidad prometidas todas ellas de responsabilidad del consell casi ninguna est terminada es m s la mayor a de ellas no est n ni siquiera iniciadas
1752019 ya es hora de que licite las cinco carreteras pendientes en el rea metropolitana de castell n

1752022 ha reducido un 20 8 por ciento los presupuestos de infraestructuras del transporte y un 49 18 por ciento 77 millones de euros las inversiones de ferrocarrils de la generalitat valenciana fgv

1752026 este es un acto valiente mediante el que los socialistas demostramos la responsabilidad que tienen que es controlar que las decisiones que el equipo de gobierno toma en este ayuntamiento no vayan en detrimento y prejuicio de los ciudadanos de alicante
1752027 utilizan el poder pol tico y administrativo para obtener resultados mediante un comportamiento orientado a la consecuci n fraudulenta de objetivos prohibidos y da inos para el inter s p blico y el patrimonio p blico
1752028 todo la documentaci n aportada con el objeto de que el fiscal tuviera una primera impresi n un conocimiento exacto de la denuncia presentado
1752029 injustas ya que se asume en ellas el pago del 50 por ciento de los costes lo que supone un detrimento de las arcas municipales y por tanto del inter s p blico y colectivo a favor del urbanizador
1752030 desde el primer momento fue a favor y en defensa de los intereses del urbanizador a n por encima de los informes de los diferentes t cnicos pertenecientes a varios servicios
1752031 se lleg a despedir a un t cnico y trasladar a otro a un puesto sin contenido como recompensa por realizar informes en contra de asumir costes que no corresponden y defender los intereses de los ciudadanos
1752032 es necesaria una pol tica de inmigraci n seria responsable y sostenible este es el pacto de estado por la inmigraci n que debe trabajar el ministro corbacho y as se lo exijo al gobierno central que es el que tiene las competencias para controlar los flujos migratorios que precisamente se asientan en las comunidades aut nomas las cuales deben tener voz en ese gran acuerdo estatal
1752033 el gobierno valenciano est arruinado y con ello arrastra a toda la comunitat debido a su pol tica de endeudamiento incesante a trav s de grandes eventos y gastos desproporcionados de dinero p blico
1752034 carecer de proyectos s lidos para superar una situaci n econ micamente complicada
1752035 no haber sido capaz de administrar correctamente los a os de bonanza econ mica y dejar pasar grandes ayudas europeas
1752036 no tiene ning n modelo de financiaci n p blica viable y s lo conoce el modelo del derroche
1752037 arroja unos datos tan negativos que hacen temblar una vez m s la estabilidad de la televisi n p blica de todos los valencianos
1752038 contin a sin elaborar un plan de viabilidad como el que s que hizo el psoe en tve
1752039 sigue endeud ndonos m s y m s ampliando pr stamos que hipotecan nuestro futuro y que son exclusivamente para pagar gasto corriente e intereses
1752040 evidencia que el pp no tiene ni idea de gestionar una televisi n p blica viable y sostenible
1752041 s lo saben hacer una televisi n manipulada y arruinada
1752042 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1752043 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1752044 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1752045 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1752046 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1752047 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1752048 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1752049 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1752050 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1752051 ha sido incapaz de cumplir los plazos y las conversiones previstas en el protocolo que firm el ministerio con la generalitat en abril de 2005
1752052 inspire future design directions for firefox the mozilla project and the web as a whole
1752053 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1752054 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1752055 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1752056 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand
1752057 the minute we got it i thought 1808 to 2008 thats 200 years
1752058 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
1752059 richard never used an alarm clock he was comprehensively alarmed
1752060 look that there is orion thats his belt and his sword hes holding a shield in his right hand and a raised club in his left see and that red star at his shoulder is called betelgeuse
1752061 theyre hit and miss stargazers new to meteor showers can be let down because they expect to see something amazing but then only see two or three meteors
1752062 sometimes ill see five in one night in a dark sky just while im walking around
1752063 its not a matter of which combination it should be in orions hands
1752064 it wasnt this one represents this its just a story folklore i mean hercules is sprawled out up there and hes not holding anything
1752065 the king of the island chios had a lovely daughter merope his island was filled with savage beasts and to rid his kingdom of these dangerous animals the king called on orion to kill the beasts and make his kingdom safe when the task was done orion met merope and made unwelcome advances in punishment he was blinded by the king but after doing penance he had his sight restored after reaching an old age however orion one day stepped on a scorpion which stung and killed him on his death the gods placed him in the sky with his faithful dogs pleiades a cluster of stars in the constellation taurus run from the hunter who pursues them each night across the sky the scorpion scorpius was also placed in the sky but on the other side of the heavens so that orion would never again be threatened by it
1752066 stars twinkle because we are looking at them through a thick constantly moving layer of air earths atmosphere
1752067 imagine you are out in the desert on a hot day looking down a straight road
1752068 as you look down the road the line on the road seems to shift around and the air looks like its shimmering and moving this is because the air next to the road is very hot and its rising as hot air does this means that the air is changing density and moving along your line of sight and this causes things you see through that air to appear to move and shimmer
1752069 this is the same effect we see as we look at stars or the distant lights of a city
1752070 all of the air between you and a star or the light is moving around different parts of the air have different temperatures and different densities so it bends the light around making it look like its twinkling
1752071 the stars no longer twinkle and we can take much clearer pictures
1752072 interestingly planets do not appear to twinkle the way stars do because they have an actual finite size because they are so much closer to us than the stars
1752073 if you look at a planet through binoculars you will see that it has a disk whereas stars still just look like points this makes it so that the light from a planet gets kind of averaged out so that we dont see it twinkle
1752074 if i had to make a list of all the things stargazers should see the milky way tops the list
1752075 the milky way is a of so many stars shining at us that we cant distinguish any of the stars
1752076 its combined light from all of the stars of the milky way that we cant see individually we are orbiting perpendicular to the galaxy so thats why we kind of see it overhead and you cant tell but the center of our galaxy is in the constellation sagittarius when youre looking at the constellation sagittarius youre looking at the direction of the center of our galaxy
1752077 its a cluster of young bright stars born at the same time in the same location
1752078 because sirius is so bright the light sensitivity of your eye will actually try to determine the color of the star
1752079 its one of the few that really looks like what its supposed to represent
1752080 even if youre in a bright city its actually one of the easiest constellations to point out because its one of the largest
1752081 not as big as orion but its pretty large and theres not many bright stars around it so it really sticks out at night around midnight
1752082 its one of the brightest things in the constellation so it wont be hard to miss
1752083 it has a sort of yellowish glow its right in the middle right in the belly of leo
1752084 hercules first labor was to kill the nemean lion a fierce beast who descended to earth from the moon in the form of a meteor and ravaged the countryside of corinth the lion had hide so tough that neither spear nor arrow nor any other weapon could pierce it so well known was the beast that hercules had no trouble finding its lair a cave with two entrances as hercules approached the lion showed itself and hercules sped an arrow toward its heart the arrow merely bounced off and fell to the ground hercules now knew that arrows or spears were useless against the beast he then sealed of one of the entrances to the cave and pursued the lion inside through the other entrance so great was his strength that hercules seized the lion and strangled it to death by ramming his fist down its throat he then flung it over his shoulder and returned to show king eurystheus that he had fulfilled his first labor the cowardly king was terrified at the sight of the beast and fled hercules then used the beasts own claws to skin the lion and used its pelt as a cloak of invulnerable armor and donned the lions head as a helmet so angry was hera at hercules success that she raised the soul of the lion high into the sky
1752085 il processo attuativo delle misure di riorganizzazione e razionalizzazione delle spese di personale
1752086 respetuoso en las formas y moderno en las propuestas prudente con madurez que sepa tender puentes constructivos en el partido pero tambi n en la sociedad valenciana
1752087 ha hablado en demasiadas ocasiones en clave org nica de partido a falta de un proyecto viable y visible para la sociedad valenciana alej ndose poco a poco del valencianismo sociol gico
1752088 ha perdido independencia pol tica debido a la orfandad de liderazgo
1752089 aglutine la axiolog a que se espera de un partido democr tico es decir la honestidad pol tica entendida como la actitud de no inflar artificialmente las expectativas de los ciudadanos la transparencia a trav s de la articulaci n de una verdadera democracia interna y la cohesi n social o capacidad para saber interpretar las necesidades y los anhelos actuales de la sociedad valenciana
1752090 se d un paso adelante en la concepci n del valencianismo pol tico reforzando los valores identitarios actuales y el mayor grado de autogobierno sin complejo alguno y en el marco de una espa a plural
1752091 la secretar a de estado de turismo convoc una l nea de ayuda p blica para impulsar los procesos de planificaci n estrat gica gesti n y promoci n de destinos tur sticos para entidades locales cuyo objetivo era que las administraciones p blicas implicasen al sector empresarial para la constituci n o potenciaci n de organismos mixtos que lideren las estrategias tur sticas locales y dijo
1752092 resulta curioso que todo un presidente de la diputaci n como carlos fabra se dedique a atacar las pol ticas tur sticas del gobierno cuando el ayuntamiento de la capital es incapaz de desarrollar una estrategia de turismo de calidad sostenible y rentable
1752093 s lo aporte 6 euros al patronato municipal de turismo la misma cantidad que la agencia valenciana de turismo castell n cultural la c mara de comercio y las empresas privadas seg n refleja el informe econ mico financiero del presupuesto del patronato municipal
1752094 carlos fabra que es concejal de castell n aunque se ausente en los plenos deber a hacer un poco de autocr tica y pensar si con esta aportaci n econ mica se pueden desarrollar proyectos para mejorar la calidad del turismo castellonense
1752095 conseguir que el sistema tur stico provincial sea m s competitivo y sostenible no se consigue con demagogia barata sino con inversi n econ mica y con participaci n social
1752096 es justamente por la ejecuci n de la infraestructura si el coste de la ejecuci n de la infraestructura hubiera sido menor evidentemente el beneficio hubiera sido tambi n menor
1752097 siempre habr aportaciones p blicas porque es una televisi n p blica al igual que sucede prosigui con todas las televisiones p blicas que se financian de aportaciones p blicas aparte de los ingresos que pueda tener ligados a su propia actividad principalmente los que vienen de la publicidad
1752098 va a reconocer esta doble v a de financiaci n junto con las medidas que sean necesarias
1752099 de televisi n espa ola tve o el de otras televisiones auton micas
1752100 se va a financiar como el resto de televisiones p blicas y adem s lo va a hacer en la forma y manera que ya est pr cticamente establecido en todas aquellas que se financiaban recurriendo al endeudamiento como lo hace canal 9 o como lo hac an tve o algunas otras televisiones no va a variar mucho
1752101 habr que ampliar la l nea de financiaci n principalmente porque ya no va a poder financiarse recurriendo al endeudamiento
1752102 las que tienen que ir ligadas a la parte de ingresos y aportaciones
1752103 los contratos programas que ya tienen otras televisiones p blicas
1752104 with each of the 350 people connected to the club keen supporters of the sky blues to work so closely together will prove to be very beneficial to both clubs
1752105 we get comments from many people saying that if home games didnt clash they would love to support both teams so this will allow them to watch non league football as well as supporting city at the ricoh arena
1752106 it also gives our junior players the chance to watch our own first team play without missing the sky blues in action as many them are season ticket holders at the ricoh arena
1752107 we would encourage our fans to support local football bringing the links between championship and grassroots football closer together
1752108 it is in everybodys interests to work together and with a friendly fixture arranged to mark our new link up with sphinx it would be nice to think that plenty of our fans will get behind them whenever possible this season
1752109 est potenciando las tecnolog as de la informaci n y la comunicaci n ante la buena acogida que tiene tanto por los docentes como y sobre todo por parte del alumnado
1752110 de ah que se est trabajando en la extensi n del uso de las pizarras digitales con una inversi n que supera los casi cuatro millones de euros
1752111 el conjunto de los recursos tecnol gicos ha alcanzado tal volumen que para gestionarlos del modo m s eficiente posible se ha creado el puesto de coordinador en tecnolog as de la informaci n y comunicaci n en todos los centros docentes p blicos dependientes de la generalitat
1752112 no es real ya que en valencia es mucho menor el peso de los agrarios por cuenta propia que en el resto de comunidades aut nomas espa olas es decir mientras que por ejemplo en andaluc a el 1 de enero pasaron a cotizar 33 904 agrarios por cuenta propia en la comunitat tan s lo lo hicieron 12 764
1752113 es bueno que asistamos en una situaci n como la actual de crisis econ mica a un crecimiento del n mero de emprendimientos en nuestra comunidad pero hay que estar alerta de las bajas o decrecimientos concentradas en las zonas costeras municipios donde el peso de la construcci n es mayor

1752117 we found very promptly that after drinking green tea there was a protective effect on the endothelium

1752135 there are a lot of folks a lot of brothers walking around and they look like men they might even have sired a child but its not clear to me that theyre full grown men
1752136 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession to the extent that were getting that thats just great
1752137 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1752138 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1752139 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1752140 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1752141 the united states was spying on china from beyond chinas borders the united states will continue to spy on china because chinas government is a potential threat to the people of the united states

1752151 never really cared what americans or the french thought of him and his ideas he wasnt speaking to them
1752152 after they cuffed me they rolled me down to the ground
1752153 i couldnt break my fall and slammed my head into the concrete that knocked me out the whole time i was unconscious they had me in the choke hold when i came to i didnt know what was going on and they were still choking me i started screaming when i screamed they started kneeing me in the head and neck
1752154 he suffered head trauma and had marks on his neck
1752155 you can see how striking the difference is compared to the rest of the city
1752156 you could go out and look around and not see folks you were used to seeing
1752157 along with the vacant homes it was an indicator that families have moved on
1752158 i think that that was a marker for how devastated the communities could be
1752159 and crime has gone down 62 percent in that area
1752160 i wouldnt attribute all the reduction in murder rates and crime to the fact there are fewer people
1752161 its too convenient to decide that because we have vacant and boarded up homes we have fewer criminals not every home that is now vacant was full of criminals carrying guns families lived in those homes
1752162 approval from the european commission for the merger is another important step toward completing our pro competitive merger with northwest

1752164 i didnt want to ruin how someone might interpret the song by explaining my own personal reason for writing it
1752165 the production quality of danger mouse just compels me to be very introspective
1752166 im not sure why it does that to me but it does and it happens in a very genuine honest way and i think it resonates to people
1752167 sure its moody and melancholy and all those things but there is a silver lining to it
1752168 out of 10 things he played me im sure seven of them went onto what is now known as st elsewhere
1752169 i describe our relationship as him being a picket fence around my garden of wildflowers
1752170 well let a few people hear it and see what they think
1752171 it may cause quite a frenzy but its all informal and idealistic at this point
1752172 i am more about coexisting i believe theres a time and a place for all things music doesnt necessarily have to convey a message it can just be to entertain you
1752173 such is american business i guess where the desire for obscene profit mutes any discussion of conscience
1752174 we will continue to do the best job we can but we may not be able to have as many officers in the stations
1752175 unfortunately theres a lot of resentment of heather for who she is without regard for what shes accomplished shell be fine
1752176 shes a very good person she means well and she works her ass off but its not working and i dont think many people would argue otherwise
1752177 its like watching your pitcher serve up one home run ball after another and not seeing the manager come out of the dugout
1752178 its not about the terrorists its about us its about what kind of country we are
1752179 is to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad
1752180 the signing statement is saying i will only comply with this law when i want to and if something arises in the war on terrorism where i think its important to torture or engage in cruel inhuman and degrading conduct i have the authority to do so and nothing in this law is going to stop me
1752181 the cia should have the ability to use additional techniques
1752182 the practice of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries of detaining thousands without charge or trial of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law
1752183 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
1752184 prosecution of any officials if it were to occur would probably not occur during obamas first term
1752185 instead we may well see a congressionally empowered commission that would seek testimony from witnesses in search of the truth about what occurred though some witnesses might be offered immunity in exchange for testimony the question of whether anybody would be prosecuted would be deferred to a later date meaning obamas second term if such is forthcoming
1752186 the commission would focus strictly on detention torture and extraordinary rendition or the practice of spiriting detainees to a third country for abusive interrogations the panel would focus strictly on these abuses leaving out any other allegedly illegal activities during the bush administration such as domestic spying
1752187 silk road to ruin is central asia the new middle east
1752188 over the past few years ive had an uncomfortable sense that someone or something has been tinkering with my brain remapping the neural circuitry reprogramming the memory
1752189 immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy my mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument and id spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose thats rarely the case anymore now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages i get fidgety lose the thread begin looking for something else to do i feel as if im always dragging my wayward brain back to the text the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle
1752190 when we read online we tend to become mere decoders of information our ability to interpret text to make the rich mental connections that form when we read deeply and without distraction remains largely disengaged
1752191 this is a lot of work and a lot of responsibility since the aircraft flies a lot i can fix anything on this aircraft besides the armament
1752192 i load the hellfire missiles rockets and the 30 mm cannon
1752193 we maintain all the armament communication and avionics this is a complicated aircraft and it always keeps me busy doing this job is very fast paced because we are constantly loading and downloading ammunition
1752194 my job is to refuel the apache aircrafts on the flight line
1752195 ive had as many as twelve aircraft at once needing to be refueled during my tours here in iraq each one requires about 350 gallons and they cant fly without fuel flying is how they pilots support the ground troops keeping them in the air is how we support the mission
1752196 overall the camaraderie with my peers is what i enjoy most about this job since ive been with this unit
1752197 it is difficult with just having a baby but you just keep trying to do your best

1752204 hip hop is synonymous with fights and shootings to authority figures
1752205 the police are very hesitant about any club that plays hip hop that was one of the first things that came up are you playing hip hop
1752206 but i dont want pressure from the city or sfpd
1752207 if the police feel your venue is creating a nuisance they show up every night check your permits walking into your venue upsetting your customers
1752208 they do frequent inspections with the fire department and the building department and get you for every little violation short of suspending permits and filing lawsuits theres lots of ways city bureaucracy can make it difficult to do business
1752209 occasionally some shows have problems the police have to deal with almost without exception that label gets thrown at hip hop when most events including hip hop are very cool
1752210 instead of addressing that the city wants to blame entertainment and specifically hip hop but violence is rare inside the venue itself
1752211 not in the clubs but a block away that may have possibly involved people who were at the club frequently police will blame the club for incidents in the neighborhood
1752212 angel cruz deserves a lot of credit that club six is open four nights a week has enabled other bars and restaurants to open around it that area has been somewhat revitalized
1752213 its older demographically wealthier more harried and professional aside from hip hop and violence people are less tolerant about noise young people create
1752214 neighbors sometimes freak out when a club is bringing large groups of minorities into the neighborhood
1752215 for a city that prides itself on being progressive when it comes to nightlife it has the most reactionary policies that seem based around race using words like urban as cover
1752216 this is an enforcement strategy around clubs that field operations have already launched
1752217 the story i want to tell here is about a young man and what could have been a family
1752218 ive always believed that cars are the root of all evil
1752219 thinking about offshore drilling because we need to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and use our domestic something so wrong with that
1752220 we need to lessen our dependence on oil in general
1752221 the most rewarding experience of the week has been the commute and bus time as quality time with the girls
1752222 the conversations have been rambling meaningful silly and wonderful we all come home in a much better mood and because i have been forced to slow down i dont come home in a flurry with a list of things to do
1752223 man with a snap of my fingers girls fall in line to get to me
1752224 man you gotta come over here i got a a girl that i cant handle do you think you could help me out
1752225 shes in the bedroom on the bed go on in
1752226 what is the biggest obstacle to a government for the people by the people in the united states
1752227 hi my name is im with the dnc and we are working this fall to elect senator barack obama and democrats everywhere
1752228 as long as youre in conversation then youre still doing well
1752229 thats terrific it is wonderful to know that you support our cause
1752230 at the dnc we push our strongest supporters to set an example and donate as much as they can even a small donation today would help us
1752231 obama is going to tax the hell out of us if you look at his politics he is the most left of any presidential candidate this country has ever seen and his judicial nominations will skew the courts left for years
1752232 this is the third time you have been here this month
1752233 id be just as happy to live a humble life as it is written in the quran
1752234 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
1752235 i dont understand how anyone could say they are gay and muslim it is not compatible with our teachings
1752236 if someone was to claim they were gay they would not be allowed to be a muslim anymore
1752237 whoever has intercourse with a woman and penetrates her rectum or with a man or with a boy will appear on the last day stinking worse than a corpse people will find him unbearable until he enters hellfire and god will cancel all his good deeds
1752238 there has been a massive policy shift in the conservative jewish world
1752239 they now permit ordaining gay and lesbian rabbis and same sex marriages but its up to the actual rabbinical seminary synagogue and communal organizations not all of them are that open
1752240 i know islam to be generally more restrictive than other religions about homosexuality
1752241 same sex sex acts have been a human practice forever but prior to the past 200 years there is no religion on the planet that even considered the possibility of homosexuality in the way we think of it today in the west yes its true that muslims both in america and the rest of the world have trouble accepting this version of homosexuality
1752242 gives us a false sense of comfort about how tolerant the world is today
1752243 the world is evil my faith gives me something to value more than myself my passion is the shadow of my soul my devotion is for my god and the purpose of my life is love
1752244 if i could i would not choose to be gay
1752245 my father and sometimes my mother would beat me if i didnt say my prayers
1752246 i went from 150 down to close to 75 pounds
1752247 my family and most of my pakistani friends back home dont know i am gay
1752248 my identity is being a muslim before i am gay danish or pakistani i am a muslim
1752249 being gay allows me to love someone else and feel that love in return
1752250 for westerners the opposite of freedom is slavery but for most cultures the opposite of slavery has never been freedom but community
1752251 i want to be allowed to be both gay and muslim
1752252 i will never give up my faith and i will never come out

1752256 now we find out that the security agencies are pushing ahead with the program anyway despite that clear congressional prohibition the program described by current and former intelligence officials in mondays wall street journal could be modeled on orwells big brother

1752258 while informal contact between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and irans chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili will continue we have no choice but to pursue further
1752259 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1752260 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1752261 iran has a clear choice engagement or isolation we regret that irans leaders appear to have chosen isolation if iran continues to refuse to come to the negotiating table the international pressure on iran will only grow
1752262 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations
1752263 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1752264 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september
1752265 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well

1752285 you were never really concerned about the future when you were a kid you played mostly by yourself and created elaborate imaginary games you talked to yourself constantly you liked to do artistic stuff drawing coloring finger painting writing little stories dancing and singing it didnt matter if you were the only one there you acted out all the parts and pretended there was an audience too just as long as you were being creative you were happy when we moved into the apartment and you had playmates you would make up stories for them to act out and you would direct them you were also so creative and had so much fun doing it
1752286 i want to push you a little bit indulge me

1752291 super tuesday didnt decide it but the potomac primaries might have
1752292 if we do not award clinton the nomination when she did not recieve the most elected delegates did not win the popular vote and took half the states i e lost by virtually any metric will clinton supporters flee to mccain
1752293 a lot of coverage was based on exit polls that turned out to be wrong
1752294 it would be all but over if it were winner take all
1752295 as obama continues to court the economic populist vote we are likely to see a continuation of some of the messaging that hasnt played in canadas favour but this should continue to be viewed in the context in which it is delivered
1752296 reassured the canadians that his candidates pledge to renegotiate nafta was merely political posturing
1752297 if tony sopranos job really was in waste disposal then his wife might be in this category women who shop at wal mart once a week or more tend to be lower income less well educated and more likely to work in hourly wage jobs or be retired than their counterparts who primarily shop at target

1752299 gods children can get an unprecedented 40 percent of the latino vote
1752300 by the number of new people obama has brought into the political process
1752301 i was very curious to see how he could inspire people
1752302 i think we should use the hammer of a potential opt out as leverage
1752303 i think its somewhat disturbing that he would say one thing in ohio and then have his campaign send a private signal to a foreign government which is presenting exactly the opposite of what hes saying in ohio
1752304 this is part of a pattern and i think its a pattern that deserves closer examination
1752305 another way for big business to escape and build sweat shops down there
1752306 allow global conglomerates to exploit cheap labor and nonexistent work rules
1752307 i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues
1752308 even when i confront him with emphatic evidence that those tax cuts have been an economic triumph and have increased revenues he is unrepentant and defends his
1752309 we have a wealth gap in this country and that worries me
1752310 i believe that mccain is really under a conversation process to supply side economics
1752311 one of the things he told me a month or two ago he said when i opposed the bush tax cuts i didnt think they would work it turns out i was wrong that was really reassuring to me
1752312 because of my concerns with no commensurate restraint in spending
1752313 i think that he has basically become really intrigued with ideas of how we can get rates down the first manifestation of that is when he came out for a corporate tax cut which is now a centerpiece of his economic platform
1752314 i think his support for a cap and trade carbon emissions control scheme will end up being the most damaging to him among conservatives i have a lot of friends calling me up with their list of grievances and one of them is always near the top is his position on global warming
1752315 more people have voted for me than anyone who has ever run for the democratic nomination that is more than 17 million voters

1752317 zrc2 com is not perfect as a relatively new site content is still being added with sections such as subcontractor services in need of attention
1752318 i was always scared that my mom and dad would find out and wouldnt like me and my brothers wouldnt like me
1752319 i was petrified because i didnt want anyone to find out and i would try to be the toughest person around that way no one would suspect no one would ever say it no one would think it
1752320 she was telling me they went up to a pastors door and knocked on the door
1752321 he didnt marry them so they went to another pastors house
1752322 he couldnt hear real well and he didnt talk much anyway
1752323 that was his way of socializing with you was to share dr pepper
1752324 she was going to make sure even though he never went anywhere his clothes were going to be starched
1752325 its too expensive its not fun i cant hear anyone talk at the table because its too loud everyone is more interested in looking around than talking anyway it sucks
1752326 i agree that i wouldnt want to go there every night but dont you think its fun to be in the middle of everything once and a while
1752327 i still just dont get it you wont even go there to celebrate heathers birthday she is pumped about going there
1752328 ill grill her a hamburger next week at my house i just dont like that place i feel like a bad person after ive been there for more than an hour or so
1752329 if what youre after is an intimate dinner without seeing other people why ever go out to eat why not just stay home every weekend and grill hamburgers
1752330 the obvious message of the ad was to scare people into thinking obama is somehow linked to these white women
1752331 using a disparate array of materials she creates figurative objects that simultaneously reference egyptian greek and indian sculpture while recalling modern and contemporary works by giacometti guston and kiefer obliquely political her works bear witness to crises in the middle east yet her themes are far more universal she transcends the particulars of religion to explore the suffering inherent in the human condition and the eternal hope for regeneration
1752332 the recent work has begun to connect more and more with the history of sculpture ranging from the ancient to the modern from eastern to western art the stories and themes i am interested in such as war colonialism displacement and the subsequent memories of home are eternal themes found in all cultures i am making work out of humble discarded materials to create what i call landscapes of human debris

1752342 we live in a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants in a world that has achieved brilliance without wisdom power without conscience we have solved the mystery of the atom and forgotten the lessons of the sermon on the mount we know more about war than we know about peace more about dying than we know about living
1752343 we live in an insecure uncertain world it is also a time of opportunity
1752344 we are all aware that we are living in an increasing culture of violence and if we are to survive we need to build a culture of non violence choosing not to kill another human being is the greatest contribution each of us can make to peace this is not a hard choice when through prayer meditation morality or logic we come to realize that our lives are sacred as is the life of all our brothers and sisters and there are always alternatives to violence which work human beings are evolving and there is a new consciousness that we must choose non violence and build strong relationships and community
1752345 blessed are the poor the mournful the meek those who hunger and thirst for justice the merciful the pure in heart the peacemakers those persecuted for the sake of justice and love your enemies
1752346 are you trying to tell me something okay i promise here and now to dedicate my life to the sermon on the mount to promoting peace and justice on one condition if you give me a sign
1752347 the cross was neither a religious icon nor metaphor for personal anguish or humility
1752348 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
1752349 my ways are not your ways my thoughts are not your thoughts
1752350 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
1752351 blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness they will be filled
1752352 god requires and he has already told you what that is be just be merciful and walk humbly with your lord
1752353 for with the measure you measure against another it will be measured back to you
1752354 blessed are the pure in heart for they see god
1752355 blessed are the peacemakers they shall be called the children of god
1752356 the violence stops here in my body which is given for you
1752357 the question is not how much more sophisticated our plants and weapons can become but how serious we are as a nation to lead the world with an alternative vision which interprets power differently and promotes peaceful coexistence globally
1752358 complex transformation is the bush administration proposed plan to restructure the nations nuclear weapons infrastructure
1752359 the administrations goal is to consolidate existing nuclear facilities while increasing the capacity to produce material for new nuclear weapons
1752360 the main justification for the program is the perceived need for a more adaptable and responsive nuclear infrastructure to react to unnamed future threats
1752361 the god of peace is never glorified by human violence the radical truth of reality is that we are all one

1752364 a new front in the global war on terror has opened up

1752366 indeed the policy of neglect is reflected in the gallery of portraits of former mayors that decorate the jerusalem municipality kollek olmert mordechai ish shalom gershon agron yitzhak kariv zalman shragai daniel auster
1752367 possibly the most blatant example of this neglect is the shuafat refugee camp which was included in jerusalems municipal boundaries
1752368 whoever thinks the basic pattern of life in jerusalem can continue with 270 000 arabs in east jerusalem must take into account that there will be bulldozers trucks and private cars and no way of preventing terror attacks of this kind
1752369 whats new and exciting is the breath taking growth were seeing in places like china and india and south america and russia more recently
1752370 our guess is that in 2012 85 million units will be sold globally probably about 80 percent of that in emerging developing markets
1752371 the biggest downside risk is that the u s economy doesnt show sustained growth
1752372 every piece of data suggests that most of our growth is going to be outside of the u s
1752373 so weve changed the structure of the company to address that one that functions globally responsible for revenue generation in each region
1752374 build where we sell we build plants in china we produce cars and we sell almost all of them in china we do the same thing in europe
1752375 we cant shy away from globalization i dont think americans are afraid to compete
1752376 the data is absolutely irrefutable that relatively more free trade is good for consumers and societies and long term economic growth and drives greater competitiveness of industries
1752377 so any move by the u s to move back from a fairly progressive position on trade would be long term not good for the u s economy and would send a tough message to the rest of the world

1752382 we rolled the dollar general honda off the truck down at kentucky last week and we had a pretty fast racecar
1752383 i was able to hang up the owner hat and be a driver and it was so relieving to be back on the racetrack overall our test went extremely well and my engineer was very pleased with the car as was i we developed a great baseline of consistency in the car from the test which will give us a great starting point on friday to be coming back to kentucky speedway with our new sponsor dollar general and for it to be our first race back on the circuit is really special we have been very busy these past few months with side projects and working on items we didnt have time for during may we expect to do well at kentucky and dont think a top 10 would be out of the question
1752384 absolutely we worked a long time to reach this level and we arent going to go down easy this is the biggest race of the year and one we want really bad weve won it before and after finishing second so many times we can kind of just go do our thing i can say well treat it like another night but its just not that simple everyone will be there the stakes are at their highest and thats when you as a competitor want to be your best there are so many things that can overwhelm you so experience is the key understanding how to handle it all is a big part of it i certainly want to be the favorite and i know this tony stewart racing team is the best team out here so we should be the favorites now we just want to go out wednesday night and perform like the favorites that starts with putting down a good qualifying in the armor all chevy parkerstore no 15
1752385 it starts in january you have to have a team that is prepared so that even after racing all summer you can roll into knoxville with your best stuff ready to go my guys have done a great job over the years and we learned that being prepared is really a big factor in succeeding the next thing i learned is that every lap is crucial you have to qualify well you have to go to the front in your heat race and you have to get on the podium in your qualifying night feature to have a chance on saturday night when you get to saturday enjoy the whole day however you can dont keep yourself isolated where you can over think things walk around talk to people and that way by the time the race finally gets going your mind is still fresh when the race starts take every chance you can this is the knoxville nationals and you never know what will happen next

1752430 my grandmother raised us so she would take a string and measure our feet so shed know what size to buy
1752431 you drove down the street and then when the bus would stop youd see the sign colored here youd see the restroom coloreds only we saw colored and automatically started coming back to what wed been taught that little one week experience was being erased
1752432 i know this that when we went to new york city i knew that something was wrong with the society down here
1752433 change is a little shaky you dont know what they expect
1752434 all of my life i wanted to sit at those counters and drink a coke or a 7up
1752435 it really didnt matter which but i had been taught that those seats were for whites only blacks were to sweep around the seats and keep them clean so whites could sit down
1752436 you know we dont serve colored folks at this counter
1752437 you take these children out of here this moment did you hear me
1752438 we ordered quite a few days and didnt get anything i think they were just as surprised to see us
1752439 and they were ignoring us it was a surprise when they finally served us
1752440 most of the businesses targeted for protests or sit ins came to the realization fairly quickly that resistance to de segregation was bad for business
1752441 it was not a popular thing because you had a lot of people in our own community who were frightened they would lose their jobs if they took part and you had a lot of whites that were angry a few who had wanted to become involved at first because it represented social change
1752442 i had people who would laugh at me when i went into the classroom
1752443 young people from all around the country started standing up and sitting down our lives changed every saturday we were doing the same thing we were protesting
1752444 afterward i tried to be nice to people and give them a smile and try to get to know a person
1752445 for someone to think that a group of people of any race is bad just because they want the same rights as other people is sad because it takes all of us to make this world were in this boat together
1752446 the other thing it taught me was not all whites were like that we cant generalize theres good and bad in every one of us

1752451 i asked my then manager if i could work wednesdays at home and he was totally open to it it turns out i actually got more done on that day than the other days
1752452 if current projections turn out to be even slightly optimistic the castles that political leaders are building in the sky will all come tumbling down
1752453 the problem is not in doing projections even ones for 15 years
1752454 the problem is spending the revenues the projections suggest might become available it takes all the slack out of the system
1752455 i do not believe there is a consensus in this congress or in this country to make the kind of draconian reductions that would be required
1752456 believe me we were stretching it when we did five year projections
1752457 any time you get out beyond a few years youre in never never land

1752478 if it were a true compulsion id expect he would
1752479 i had to get to an olive garden on the day that i pitched
1752480 i always ordered the chicken parmesan it was especially tough on the road if there wasnt an olive garden within walking distance i was taking a cab
1752481 then you just hope everything goes right when you pitch but when it doesnt you can blame it on the fact that you couldnt find an olive garden
1752482 i only put it on when im desperate to get out of a big slump
1752483 i was 0 for 32 and i hit a homer on the first pitch
1752484 breaking a taboo players believe leads to undesirable consequences or bad luck
1752485 taboos usually grow out of poor performances which players in search of a reason attribute to a particular behavior
1752486 obviously its all mental but the mind is a powerful thing if you believe something is going to help you whatever
1752487 i have three pair of cleats here im on my second pair so ive got to make them last through the year
1752488 when your level of success at something is very high you make very simple theories about what works
1752489 but when your level of success at something falls below 40 or 50 percent which it does in most sports it creates much more complex cognitive theories about what you have to do to be successful
1752490 when that success happens we ignore facts or logic and our thoughts and actions can be strongly influenced by superstition we believe in the feelings we believe in the power of belief
1752491 there are little things that can help boost your confidence and give you a mental edge
1752492 i did it changing shoes earlier this year and it helped me out
1752493 you dont want to admit that you give into something that small
1752494 a type of coping mechanism that works to create a successful behavior its a behavioral routine that gets one into a state to be able to perform with excellence
1752495 the problem is we fear negative consequences a lot more than we value positive ones what happens to an athlete is that if he wore a particular sock or pair of shirts or did some ritual and had success hell continue to do that that act reduces the anxiety associated with not doing it its the exact same mechanism clinically we find in obsessive compulsive people
1752496 but if you ask them what they do to give themselves confidence theyll tell about their rituals and beliefs all that is superstition if they realized it really is functional they wouldnt be so reluctant to admit it
1752497 a lot of times you want to create routines for yourself
1752498 theyre superstitions but they are also part of your routine being mentally prepared and trying to do things over and over the right way we talk to guys here about getting in a routine getting to the park at a certain time eating similar foods the night before and the day of your scheduled start when youre going good thats all part of routine and you want to have a good state of mind
1752499 its something ive always done theres really no rhyme or reason what it all comes down to is being prepared mentally and physically making sure youre doing your running lifting conditioning all that stuff its not about finding an olive garden
1752500 most athletes cant explain why they do it its something their brain is making them do they learned it before its an unconscious behavior it has nothing to do with baseball
1752501 the amateur that i was caddying for had about a three foot putt
1752502 you tend to see the older more experienced players talk about putting as being much more difficult
1752503 the efficacy is put in the ritual as opposed to the person and that detracts from that persons real learning about what they need to do theres this thing that gets built up as if it will make something happen when theres a much different set of processes that have to do with the performance
1752504 sometimes a guy is making good pitches and hes just not getting results
1752505 then you want to start changing something mechanically when its not necessary and it makes it worse
1752506 the obsessive compulsive personality would be the type of individual who would more likely be adopting these behaviors
1752507 all five of these managers exhibit inconsistent performance or a high level of tracking error

1752517 he wont experience too much of the pressures right now
1752518 captaincy will be about a few months time the next couple of series he faces
1752519 then he will really understand what its all about running a team getting the team to play for you it is going to be interesting
1752520 hes got a once off test match against us he will obviously be hugely motivated excited nervous and have a lot of energy in this game
1752521 it is easy to make one off decisions and it doesnt really matter what happens in this test match
1752522 it is six months time when you have gone through that process you have carried your team to that level you have sustained the team you want to play the brand of cricket you want to play and the management of those players
1752523 thats when it starts to show so for us the best way to keep him under pressure is to beat england
1752524 like we did to michael vaughan we kept him on the back foot in terms of his performance and as a captain we know that pressure grows very quickly upon you
1752525 i would think there is a mutual respect in terms of performance thats basically probably as far as it goes i guess
1752526 at the time i thought he had us on the ropes
1752527 we were we werent bowling well there were two very lengthy sessions and he and paul collingwood had got england right back in the game
1752528 even though they were only 140 ahead we didnt really have any answers at that time of the game
1752529 that was obviously a big opening for us and in a way we were lucky we got a lot of soft dismissals in that second innings one thing i will say is that captaincy will make him think about that now
1752530 you bump your head a lot of times as captain i certainly bumped my head a few times as a young guy
1752531 it depends also how you face up to bumping your head do you learn from them take those lessons on board those are going to be important things for him
1752532 for them it is about making the decisions not only for this test match but about when they go to india and for the ashes
1752533 to pick steve harmison now they obviously have a plan for him to play in the next ashes series at least i hope thats what they would be thinking
1752534 they have picked a little bit more of an aggressive team it does leave certain openings if we can play good cricket here and again it will be about the first couple of days
1752535 england are going to come back fighting they will want to put in one good game for the series
1752536 a legal opinion or decree handed down by an islamic religious leader
1752537 xabi scored a good goal after scoring a penalty against rangers on saturday so this is very positive
1752538 he is showing that he is a good professional but then we already knew this and i am very pleased with his commitment on the pitch
1752539 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1752540 the athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1752541 they now realise and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organising committee
1752542 it was not the most opportune time for them to wear these masks they were overly cautious
1752543 not the week i planned at the hospital times 3
1752544 you never know what is around the corner in some ways i was disappointed i wasnt thought of as a possible test captain
1752545 but once the selectors decided they wanted to unify the jobs then i probably was a bit of a non starter
1752546 you never know there may be opportunities in the future you never say never and it is something id still like to do again
1752547 i think ive still got unfinished business with the captaincy to be honest i feel i could have done the test job and made a pretty good fist of it and would have benefited a lot from the time i had in charge previously
1752548 the most important thing from my point of view is there is no point in me feeling sorry for myself the most important thing is that i get behind kevin and help him out
1752549 the issue is the england team going forward and the senior players getting behind kevin in what is going to be a bit of a learning curve for him and we need to support him as much as we can
1752550 ive already spoken to kevin about the job and he is going to need some senior players around him through those first days and weeks
1752551 we had a chat about what the job entails and i felt was best to do things
1752552 but you have got to be your own person there is no point in kevin trying to be like michael vaughan or mike atherton or mike brearley he has got to be like kevin pietersen
1752553 sometimes you have got to smooth off your edges and tiptoe around people a little bit but fundamentally youve got to be yourself
1752554 you have to take your gut decisions because you are responsible for that happens
1752555 i am sure kevin will do that he has got a very good cricketing brain and he is going to thrust himself into the job wholeheartedly
1752556 ashwell has shown in this series that hes a match winner and the fact that hes already in england with his family added to the attraction of signing him
1752557 hes in form and its always good to sign a player who is playing with confidence hell join us at a vital stage of the season and add quality to our middle order
1752558 hes an excellent fielder and he isnt involved in south africas one day international fixtures so he fits the bill for perfectly
1752559 nottinghamshire are in contention for silverware and im confident that i can add some experience to the team at an important stage of the season
1752560 i know that i am joining a competitive team and i have kept my eye on the results ever since the interest was expressed
1752561 i spoke to stuart broad at headingley long before the deal was concluded and he told me that the set up was good and that trent bridge is a great place to play cricket
1752562 im not in the south africa one day squad which frees up my time and hopefully there will be an opportunity for me to play more county cricket in the future
1752563 i gave my all at west ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us
1752564 now i will take my time to consider my football future
1752565 we respect freddie ljungbergs position and are pleased we could reach agreement and wish him all the best in the future
1752566 troopers run amok conduct mass arrest of peaceful pro lifers in maryland
1752567 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1752568 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1752569 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1752570 i told him what are the odds of me being in town for 10 consecutive monday mornings
1752571 but the dean was persistent he said what if we made the class at night and what if it went for five weeks instead of 10 finally i said id try it and i was hooked
1752572 board of directors of tri county electric august 18th 2008 at 6 30 pm my whole point is to stand up for those who dont actually know they can within a co op situation called
1752573 you can easily go to a restaurant or local church to do your breathing treatments and or sleep on your cpap and then return home is it just me or i thought that my church was closed at those hours and most restaurants would have you arrested for doing such a thing
1752574 i bought new boobs and have public aid and i want to be a veterinarian because i love children because im a blonde b l o n oh i dunno
1752575 go to the village opposite where you will at once find a donkey tethered with her foal beside her untie them and bring them to me

1752577 it was already gods the mortal owner was just borrowing it
1752578 have been driving hard at the man with the golden gun
1752579 we hear a lot about him early on in the ten page dossier m consults including mentions of homosexuality and pistol fetishism but these arent followed up anywhere
1752580 james bond should have a better exit sadly the man with the golden gun ends not with a bang but a whimper the world will be a vastly more lacklustre and complicated place with 007 gone
1752581 bond and fleming were fun they entertained sometimes mildly often grandly but always consistently life will be less interesting without them
1752582 perhaps ian fleming was tired when he wrote it perhaps his publishers didnt tell us he left it unrevised the fact remains that this posthumous bond is a sadly substandard job
1752583 the latest brush to be thrown on one of the damndest wildfires of all time the james bond industry a gory glittering saga the james bond spirit soars on
1752584 the last three years has been an unbelievable experience working with such a passionate community at poolexpert

1752587 the planning for pittville park provides a useful space for thinking about the future and finding ways of creating sustainable communities that can adapt and thrive in the changing conditions of the 21st century
1752588 we are very enthusiastic and supportive of the plans for pittville park which is one of the great jewels of cheltenham were working actively in partnership with cheltenham borough council to move the project forwards
1752589 weve found a new and exciting partner in the university they can offer a wide variety of skills to help not only with our plans for pittville park but also in a wider context we are looking forward to working closely with them
1752590 our meeting has proved extremely useful in looking at ways of working together now and in the future
1752591 the recruitment of planning and transportation staff has been an enduring problem for several years
1752592 the cost of constant ineffective advertising and the expense of finding and engaging temporary staff has been extremely high
1752593 therefore the option of international recruitment although expensive in the short term was something we felt obliged to try its an innovative approach for the planning profession and i am delighted it appears to have paid off
1752594 im just thinking at the end of the day i am lucky to be alive
1752595 it could have been a lot worse than it has been im just shocked by the whole experience
1752596 it would appear the woman had spoken to the men about smoking earlier this week
1752597 this morning when she was at the station she was walking past the same men when one of them pushed her and she fell onto the track
1752598 she suffered a fractured wrist and bruising to her legs she was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been released
1752599 the woman was very lucky she was not more seriously injured the third rail carries 750 volts of electricity and she could have been electrocuted or even struck by an early morning train
1752600 we are appalled by this incident and hope the perpetrators are quickly identified
1752601 we have had concerns for some time about the poor standards of care at southfield
1752602 despite being given every opportunity the owner has failed to make the improvements necessary to meet national standards and to provide adequately for the needs of the residents
1752603 matters came to a head last week when our inspectors decided that the safety and welfare of the people living there was being put at serious risk
1752604 we could not allow this to continue and that is why we sought the urgent order to cancel the registration of the home immediately under section 20 of the care standards act 2000
1752605 the agencys investment will take forward vital site preparation works to enable the destination st helens project to get off the ground which will provide an important boost to the local economy

1752607 todays announcement is a major step forward in the life of this project public sector funding will help to prepare the site for development ultimately paving the way for one of the biggest regeneration projects to be witnessed by st helens in recent years
1752608 this is marvellous news as this funding is another key element in the progress of the new stadium
1752609 the stadium and associated developments including additional retail offer in the town will bring massive benefits not just to our borough but to the region in general bringing investment and jobs
1752610 the council is proud to be a key player in this exciting development and look forward to working with all the partners involved
1752611 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or out interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial mr fratto said
1752612 hamdan was alleged to have committed serious war crimes involving terrorist activity
1752613 hes an al qaeda warrior he has wounded and the people he has worked with have wounded the world murphy told the jury
1752614 we will capture or kill osama bin laden some day you should not punish the generals driver today with the crimes of the general the yemeni mans court appointed military lawyer navy lieutenant commander brian mizer told the court
1752615 a trial that depends on handicapping the defence cant possibly be fair said jennifer daskal senior counterterrorism counsel at human rights watch
1752616 the military judge tried at times to mitigate the commissions most unjust rules but the flaws in the system won out

1752625 it was causing problems my fiancee were fighting he lost his job
1752626 its like you might go to a snake farm but you wouldnt want to bring one of those home with you either
1752627 i think that if you are going to make an effort to come all the way over here you would thank those that are providing the freedom that they are providing for you
1752628 i dont understand why newspapers havent split off half their reporters to neighborhoods requiring them to live there and launching a network of hyperlocal news sites that all seamlessly feed back to their core site with an integrated cms beat reporters meanwhile would categorize their stories across relevant neighborhoods having a neighborhood reporter is a powerful idea especially when that reporter covers the small stuff in short form this forms a relationship and an online community that generates more tips and a larger aggregate audience
1752629 instead of spending time bemoaning how my owners are going to kill my paper id make real sure that the people on my staff were covering news relevant to the communities where subscribers live id fire a third of the editors and convert another third of them to being reporters and give them a laptop id send all my reporters home with a laptop i would tell each of them his beat is now a circle with a radius of 12 blocks and the center of the circle is his house i want to know everything that happens within those 12 blocks

1752659 el paro va a dejar de crecer o que la inflaci n va a dejar de subir
1752660 s lo los hogares letones consumen menos que los espa oles
1752661 el paro va a dejar de crecer o que la inflaci n va a dejar de subir no tienen ya ninguna credibilidad
1752662 un disparate para un pa s democr tico como espa a
1752663 c mo va a sacar a nuestro pa s de esta tremenda crisis
1752664 siga con esta actitud de no hacer absolutamente nada pensando que las cosas se solucionan solas
1752665 la primera vez en la democracia espa ola que despu s de tres o cuatro meses desde las elecciones un gobierno cae de esta manera en la confianza no s lo de todos los espa oles sino de quienes les han votado
1752666 todos los espa oles se han dado cuenta de que rodr guez zapatero les minti para presentarse a las elecciones y para hacer campa a electoral
1752667 los espa oles hemos dejado de creer en rodr guez zapatero
1752668 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing
1752669 sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor
1752670 the negotiating committee made the holiday a top priority in contract talks
1752671 and we were able to get management to commit to it
1752672 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
1752673 given the nature of our work many many many times we have to work holidays anyway and labor day is usually one of those holidays that our workers have to work
1752674 and of course they are paid holiday pay when they have to work any holiday that is recognized at our facility
1752675 this new contract is good because it allows me to work on the second shift and still pray when i need to
1752676 its very important to us and the eid is one of our most sacred holidays it shows how the union helps us
1752677 to stand up to win respect for every workers right to practice their faith
1752678 to leave and do nothing is just irresponsible to me it is a major neglect of one of the primary responsibilities of congress for the speaker to recess the house without passing a comprehensive domestic energy production bill
1752679 tying our own hands on energy production is foolish we have to untie them or the quality of life for every american is going to suffer and the only way to untie our hands is to convince the speaker to call a vote on a comprehensive domestic energy production bill
1752680 its disappointing speaker pelosi and majority leader reid care more about appeasing their hollywood friends than they do about the hardship high energy prices cause their constituents
1752681 the nation is confronted with an energy crisis congress should be working day and night to pass a comprehensive plan instead they went on vacation
1752682 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1752683 she was upset and quite frank about putting her cards on the table
1752684 the obama people are perfectly happy to have our support but their attitude seems to be we can win without you and i guess thats why none of us is going from rah rah hillary to rah rah obama
1752685 college years are the time when many young adults establish habits they will carry with them for the rest of their lives and while its important that they tackle academics its critical that they also learn everyday skills such as how to manage their money in order to become successful in life
1752686 aside from leading by example parents have an active role to play in ensuring their children are equipped to handle their own finances away from home
1752687 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing
1752688 sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor
1752689 the way college costs are increasing there is pressure in the financial services industry to be a reliable resource to help families make sound college savings decisions we want to help our members deal with that issue in an effective way and college central delivers
1752690 i think 38 years plus in education is plenty of time doing this
1752691 ive decided to go out on top of my game
1752692 i have seen both ends in the inner city schools in a challenging environment and working in the suburbs
1752693 its easy to improve things when its so awful but coming to the suburbs where things are really good was a challenge its a much greater challenge trying to go from good to great than from bad to good
1752694 it has been a great group of people to work with
1752695 texas is grateful that this storm did not escalate to hurricane strength before making landfall on our shores
1752696 yet even small storms can create dangerous situations flooding continues to be a viable threat to the coastal area and the state stands ready to deploy search and rescue assets in the event they are needed
1752697 i had no regrets harry truman was saving a lot of american lives
1752698 those were my thoughts at the time i dont know how i feel knowing what i know now
1752699 the japanese have kept it as a reminder of the horrors of war
1752700 every veteran has a story to tell the goal of this project is to ensure that those treasured memories are not lost forever
1752701 these veterans remind us that ordinary people placed in unthinkable situations can do extraordinary things
1752702 but the individual stories those add to the entire picture the goal of the voices of veterans program is to gather as many of these personal stories as we can it all comes together like a big patchwork quilt
1752703 just teaming with soldiers war machines of all sorts landing craft you name it
1752704 what we were doing was preparing to go into japan and it had been understood that every man woman and child was armed in japan waiting for us
1752705 bells rang whistles blew people were standing along the street all sorts of excitement was visible from my window on the bus
1752706 i thought oh boy they knew i was coming and theres a big celebration for old miller
1752707 it was vj day and people were celebrating the end of the war in the pacific
1752708 therefore we need a decision in this case and we have decided to seek legal relief to allow cn to close on the transaction prior to dec 31 2008
1752709 he implied he had a weapon in the note but none was seen
1752710 when you have a victim who also is a defendant in a case it causes fifth amendment issues that makes these cases difficult to proceed with and prove beyond a reasonable doubt
1752711 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
1752712 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
1752713 the er has become the front door to the hospital
1752714 the choice between jay nixon and kenny hulshof could not be any clearer
1752715 jay is the only candidate who has the know how and vision to affect positive change rather than offering more of the same the enthusiasm for jay nixon is growing and missourians are ready to vote him in to our ranks in november
1752716 kenny hulshof embodies the entrenched republican establishment that is failing citizens from missouri to washington d c voters are rejecting the george w bush matt blunt brand of leadership thats grounded in incompetence and irresponsibility
1752717 democrats long ago began to rally around jay nixon because missourians are hungry for the promising change only he can deliver
1752718 after months of in fighting the gop is in an unenviable position they bear the burden of an unpopular governor have a platform that is out of touch with mainstream missouri and struggle with massive internal divisions missouri wants change and jay has the vision experience and leadership to turn the state around
1752719 at this time we are waiting for certification from the secretary of states office we know that there are still over 500 votes that have not been counted in st louis county and while we are not aware of similar situations elsewhere we have not had the time to investigate other election jurisdictions after certification we will weigh our options including asking for a recount
1752720 were going to ask those 80 000 people in that stadium to march out of there and go with very specific instructions and goals to register millions of new voters

1752728 we have developed a flexible solution that is designed to fit the stringent requirements of school administrators

1752747 that depends never if hillary doesnt win the nomination and even if she does it depends on whether they think they have a chance to win north carolina if they dont they might not bother to campaign much here
1752748 that dont make sense to me why would the clintons spend all this time in north carolina for the primary but not the real election
1752749 she needed to do well in north carolina even if she didnt win the primary because she could still get almost half the states delegates in november its winner take all for electoral votes if she doesnt think she can take north carolina from the republicans or if she doesnt need it she wont waste much time and money trying
1752750 well ill be i figured this was gonna go on all summer is she still gonna cut my gas tax i cant afford to fill up the tractor anymore

1752786 we think a lot of bad things that happen to the cardiovascular system are because the lining of the vessels cracks and becomes inflamed setting the stage for plaques to form and rupture
1752787 if a young athlete comes off the field after a blow to the head in any sport feeling dizzy faint or have a lapse in memory its vital that they tell their coach or a team trainer equally as important coaches trainers and parents need to be observant of head injury symptoms because athletes may not report them
1752788 but of utmost importance athletes younger than 18 who have any post blow to the head symptoms affecting their thought process should not return to the same practice game or contest and be evaluated by a physician prior to return to play
1752789 teachers salesmen preachers and even telemarketers depend on their voices as much as singers do but are much less likely to realize that they need to care for and protect it

1752794 a blind spot extends about ten feet in front of the bus obstructing the drivers view
1752795 often times children are not aware of this blind spot and might mistakenly believe that if they can see the bus the bus driver can see them
1752796 parents need to consider the many factors when leaving a child home alone
1752797 children mature at different rates so it is crucial to evaluate your childs individual development as well as physical capabilities

1752800 the coders rights project will give critical legal help to programmers and developers who do the hard work in keeping technology robust and users safe
1752801 the athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1752802 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee it was not the most opportune time for them to wear these masks they were overly cautious
1752803 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations
1752804 we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1752805 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1752806 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1752807 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1752808 if the 2008 olympic games take place then they should stand for freedom and peace as a tibetan i have neither freedom nor peace therefore i dont want these games
1752809 hey if i went to your house and your mom made something really good i wouldnt eat just one bowl

1752812 we fought during four years to get to the olympics and i wont be able to be by larissa on the court
1752813 its not easy to make this decision after so many days of suffering and sacrifice im sorry that she is not in condition to be by my side in this moment that we had dreamed so much for our careers
1752814 i tried everything grabbed all the possibilities given to me by the professionals who evaluated me but unfortunately i reached my limit
1752815 we knew that this could have happened but we always worked with the expectation that i would play
1752816 there was no more time for doubts and the decision had to me mine
1752817 i thought a lot about it and realized that it wouldnt be fair to larissa the technical staff and the brazilian people for me to play without the ideal conditions to do well in the olympics
1752818 i know some people may question why i didnt make this decision earlier
1752819 but i ask would someone give up their dream this easily without fighting until the last minute

1752821 shes at an age where she is thinking with her head not just her heart

1752823 and everything about that will come through in this beautiful wedding
1752824 were still a young culture many of us are first generation americans
1752825 the priorities for my parents werent sports they were to put bread on the table to move ahead and become good american citizens
1752826 outreach programs would make things easier for people less fortunate help the kids who have potential to maybe find the road to the next level
1752827 right now there is no road its bushwhacking your way through to the other side and most of them get lost
1752828 the parents dont know their way through the system a lot of the kids cant get scholarships as easily as african americans can
1752829 i need to find out more i dont have all the answers
1752830 we have to do more to take the fine young athletes that exist among new americans and find some ways of creating opportunities for them they are underrepresented
1752831 i did have some classmates that were discouraged by parents to play sports and many were very talented
1752832 they would start the season on a sports team and halfway through quit because they couldnt make practice they had to baby sit or run errands for their moms
1752833 in commerce more parents now see that their children can represent the u s at the olympics
1752834 the city does a good job of giving their olympians a lot of recognition so residents are forced to become familiar with the olympians and that accessibility gives them hope and encouragement
1752835 the spanish networks need to do their part in exposing hispanic athletes in the nontraditional sports so that parents can see all the options their kids have

1752840 no immediate plans to put the pagerank kitty back in the bag im not 100 sure i know what that means but im going with my best guess
1752841 the new toolbar pageranks shouldnt have anything to do with whether you had a page that wasnt crawled as much for a short time
1752842 no update to the way that new penalties are assessed just the expiration of some older ones
1752843 it could be a few days before people see the toolbar pagerank changing unless they go poking around on different datacenter ip addresses

1752847 at a moment when international pressure to pursue the rpf trials is at its height this is an effort to change the subject and put the international community on the defensive
1752848 the purpose is to provide a proper secure environment for people watching and attending the games
1752849 the chinese government seems to want to have it both ways
1752850 it says that it will enable people to protest during the olympic period but is bending over backwards to ensure that any individual who might actually want to pursue that right to protest is barred from entry into china
1752851 theres systematic pressure on athletes around the world to just go there and be quiet
1752852 the rate of infection is still high but concern among corporations is low
1752853 many corporations seem to think its o k to be infected several times a month

1752985 the government needs to come out and say this is what we are doing otherwise people will just sit back and wait which is the last thing this delicate market needs
1752986 from the customers point of view it could result in them losing the house they set their heart on

1753002 as christians are freed from the ceremonial law they must walk the more closely with god in gospel obedience as heaven and earth are contrary one to the other both cannot be followed together and affection to the one will weaken and abate affection to the other those that are born again are dead to sin because its dominion is broken its power gradually subdued by the operation of grace and it shall at length be extinguished by the perfection of glory to be dead then means this that those who have the holy spirit mortifying within them the lusts of the flesh are able to despise earthly things and to desire those that are heavenly christ is at present one whom we have not seen but our comfort is that our life is safe with him the streams of this living water flow into the soul by the influences of the holy spirit through faith christ lives in the believer by his spirit and the believer lives to him in all he does

1753030 ye said unto me a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your king
1753031 and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to your fathers when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place and when they forgot the lord their god he sold them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safe
1753032 and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mothers brethren and communed with them and with all the family of the house of his mothers father saying speak i pray you in the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that i am your bone and your flesh and his mothers brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech for they said he is our brother and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baal berith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons which followed him and he went unto his fathers house at ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left for he hid himself and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in shechem
1753033 and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olive tree reign thou over us but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatness wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted over the trees and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and reign over us but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees then said the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine which cheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees then said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon
1753034 god saves his people who continually fall prey to new kings
1753035 then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto ramah and said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the lord and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man unto his city

1753039 and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will give it if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve

1753056 email is a tool and should be used to help you in your sales efforts but email is also a weapon that can destroy your sales efforts if used not properly
1753057 my conclusion watch master marketer michael rasmussen jump on board and learn how to use email marketing to bring in more money seriously
1753058 one in four adults read no books last year usa today theres a marketing lesson here weve put together a killer webinar on how to get emails delivered and read which is going to be available soon in audio visual format

1753060 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking

1753064 although stock market gains over the past couple of days have been impressive all it has done is push the indices back to the highs seen over the past couple of months

1753066 today saw many traders squaring their books ahead of thursdays interest rate announcement and with no surprises expected here we could well see the market drift lower over the next few days

1753071 coaches have been known to pressure teachers to pass athletes and also change grades to ensure their eligibility to play sports
1753072 the head basketball coach has actually gotten grade correction forms and taken them to teachers
1753073 coaches approach teachers to try to get them to either give students grades or give meaningless extra work so athletes can pass
1753074 coach johnson came to my class and has a grade correction form in his hand he wanted me to change the grade to a passing grade
1753075 mr johnson continued pressing me for the athlete to have a passing grade i finally realized that my protests were futile and so i took the grade correction form and filled it out
1753076 theyd like to see a total clean out particularly from the athletic director to the administration in order to start fresh set a new tone of expectations i dont know who first started the concept of changing grades but it really needs to stop and it needs to stop now
1753077 hopefully the signal is being sent not just to coaches not just to teachers but to administrators and the entire community that if somebody steps out of line in terms of athletic eligibility we are going to find it and investigate it and then take the appropriate action
1753078 i guess they realized that was something that was absolutely needed to be done
1753079 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot

1753091 plain and simple she needed the cans because she ran out of gas she had a faulty gas gauge simple as that
1753092 theres no reason to bring the theft up previously casey had used the gas cans theres other peoples fingerprints on them besides us and thats what theyre looking at
1753093 she was hesitant about letting me get in the car and i said well ive got an extra key ill just go get it she was adamant about that
1753094 she didnt want him to know the gas cans were in the trunk she thought she could put them back and leave him a note of apology
1753095 there was no caylee in the back of the car there was nothing else in the back of the car except the normal stuff
1753096 this is the first they were ever told that caylee might be a grandchild of theirs
1753097 they became interested in that because thats all they would have left of their son who died at age 20 this is a real surprise to them i think another news station broke the story to them as a hello big surprise at their front door and that was a very shocking event for them since that time theyve gotten unwanted media attention
1753098 i just found out that they did charge casey formally today which is a good thing because look what they charged her with to me that is actually almost a victory for the home team today because they obviously have not found anything
1753099 every moment that passes i die a little bit inside every day not having her
1753100 she is a part of me and without her i feel incomplete
1753101 we bring caylee and everybody is going to know and casey is not going to be this monster that everybody has painted her out to be
1753102 as much as i wanted to see casey today and visit with her i couldnt
1753103 i did get to meet with her attorney and he is going to be able to speak with her in private with my thoughts and the things that i want to talk to her about
1753104 i had all of these mixed feeling about should i go or shouldnt i go
1753105 bottom line was that i made the decision this morning that i wasnt going to go
1753106 it was a meeting at our request just to touch base with them and see where we are all at
1753107 casey davis and magnum mauga have both had a really good camp to date you just see that were bigger were stronger and were not getting knocked around as much in there weve got a lot of depth at that position with junior keiaho darby golden ben calderwood jervon graves alan bishop and all those guys who have played a lot and theyre big bodies that will help us in particular they will allow the linebackers to roam free by tying up those guys up front
1753108 the one area that we have a lot of depth at is our secondary weve got a lot of seniors and we have a lot of guys with significant playing experience a lot of guys who have started we moved devon hall to safety so we now have three starters from last year for two spots roy hurst was a safety last year and were moving him to corner we still have marquise charles kejon murphy chris randle geno odong all those guys at corner those are the things that jump out at me especially on defense are the number of returners that we have and the depth that we have
1753109 that was one of the first things we started with because we knew that would be a huge area for us we were very good at both in the top 10 in the ncaa in both return groups those were our concerns going in but the residue that is left from kevin is that he made some great returns but when you look at them on film there were a lot of great blocks that sprung him a majority of those guys that blocked for kevin are back so they take a lot of pride in a big return i dont think well have one guy that will do it all i think well have several guys that will catch and return punts and several guys that will catch and return kicks i dont think we can put it all on one guy those are two different types of return on a punt return youve got to really field and judge the ball first and then gets your eyes down and find where the running lane is going to be on a kickoff return it take a lot of courage because youve just got to catch the ball and then take off running at full speed because we can pretty much predict based upon the play that we call where the seam is going to be based on where we block and where we want that runner to run kevin was unique because he had the ability and the talent to do both of those i dont think we have one guy in particular that can do both as of yet but with the blockers the schemes and the pride that we have in those two we can still be effective in returning the football

1753133 measuring only the intensity of the reflected light at a few selected wavelengths could lead to a calculation of the peak shift
1753134 in fact a lspr system with high reproducibility could even be based on the amplitude of the reflected light intensity at a selected wavelength the consequence of this is significant as this would allow replacement of the spectrum analyzer and subsequent signal processing scheme by a single source of monochromatic light and a photodiode as detector the resulting photocurrent output could then be converted into a voltage by an operational amplifier with a resistor in a feedback loop i v converter and detected by a voltmeter

1753152 while i maintain that public discussion on the subject is healthy i believe that the public venue must also be an official venue not just in coffee shops speaking engagements the internet or the media those only serve as breeding grounds of ideas but the fate of the moa ultimately lies in an official venue for public discussion of policy that is congress
1753153 to continuously leave the public in the dark as to how the provisions were arrived at why they were adopted and what will be the repercussions of its acceptance or rejection only serves to fuel the fires of controversy distrust and misunderstanding
1753154 we must all take a part in the efforts to achieve peace we should not be left in the dark to simply swallow whatever it is that is fed to us because our constituents the people who entrusted us this privileged position expect us to make decisions based on carefully considered factual information

1753248 it was said to be one of the most curable cancers
1753249 i dont want cancer to win the battle or the war
1753250 i live in fear daily a lot of dealing with it is up to god who is in control of it
1753251 because heather wanted to do the marathon were going to do it regardless
1753252 ive had cancer for five years and have not been outspoken about it
1753253 i pretend i dont have it its about time i spoke out about it i do have a voice and need to be heard if i can touch at least one person thats good enough for me
1753254 i had a radiation tech three years ago who was in a marathon and really loved it
1753255 this year i said i really have to do this everyone says its a great thing to be in
1753256 youll see me walking around town first thing in the morning

1753259 the president and i agree on most issues there was a recent study that showed that i voted with the president over 90 percent of the time
1753260 john mccain supports bushs tax cut for millionaires but nothing for 100 million households hes for billions in new oil company giveaways while gas prices soar and for tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas the original maverick or just more of the same
1753261 if youre under 40 that was a long time ago man

1753265 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
1753266 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1753267 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1753268 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1753269 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1753270 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1753271 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1753272 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1753273 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1753274 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1753275 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1753276 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1753277 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1753278 i do have a hard time every now and then
1753279 theres no way i want him out on the streets

1753290 there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever in my mind that he did it
1753291 there was no one else involved and nothing satanic going on
1753292 it took on a life of its own and i became part of a cast of characters it was a whirlwind and enveloped everyones lives

1753302 i am an honest loyal funny and understanding person who does not judge people for what they have done but for who they are experience is not what happens to a man experience is what a man does with what happens to him i made a bad decision as a teenager and do not have the background in the way of life that other people have though that does not diminish my drive and ambitions to succeed in life
1753303 he poses extreme danger to the community and should not be released

1753399 the biggest advantage he has now is that hes been through the process before
1753400 so he knew what to expect and hes handled all of the other things that come with the olympic games better
1753401 i dont feel scared anymore or like the world is swirling around
1753402 sydney was tough athens was extremely tough and this will probably be harder again
1753403 but im prepared to go to the well one more time and dig as deep as i can
1753404 my love for the 100 freestyle is that big that unfortunately i am forced to adjust my ambitions
1753405 i am no longer the young god of sydney 2000 i am someone in his 30s who has to use his resources sparingly
1753406 we will release rafinha for the olympic games if the brazilian soccer association can allow him to participate at short notice
1753407 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1753408 you guys are the ones talking about it im not
1753409 after lighting it my mind went blank and then i just wanted to hurry up running ahead
1753410 this is a moment of great pride to the 1 3 billion chinese people
1753411 i send my prayers and good wishes for the success of this event
1753412 its not just about the sport its about the image of china
1753413 chairman mao would have been happy if he were here today
1753414 i am ready to go to beijing where my dope test is scheduled for tomorrow if i fail there leave apart banning me for life shoot me in public
1753415 money the money has been great i never have had to worry about money anonymous
1753416 another benefit i see is great pay all my friends with careers in stem that stopped school after their bachelors degree had their own homes just a couple years out of school
1753417 as a widow and single mother i did not have the option of staying home to raise my boys however my salary as an engineer was high enough that i was able to work part time only the hours they were in school and still make enough money to own a home
1753418 upon completion of my studies i began working as a rookie in a steel company working in the sales planning and quality departments i changed jobs to have the chance of working in 4 different countries germany uk ireland and poland and help out with the post merge integration of a trans national company a month ago i became a senior consultant manager in the company head quarters back in mexico being responsible for the products catalogues and evolution due to markets regulations
1753419 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations
1753420 we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1753421 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1753422 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1753423 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1753424 if the 2008 olympic games take place then they should stand for freedom and peace as a tibetan i have neither freedom nor peace therefore i dont want these games
1753425 overall the chinese had almost no mistakes but if we can do the same it will be a close competition
1753426 i watched yang wei on pommel horse he was very good and his routine looked effortless
1753427 they are the team to beat they have a lot more pressure on themselves being two times defending world champions its in their home country and they are expected to win here
1753428 if they mistakes and we go out there and nail all our stuff anything can happen
1753429 even at six years old it was abundantly clear that you had to be very smart to get a chance to go to the moon so when president kennedy issued his challenge on may 25 1961 to send a man to the moon and return him safely within ten years i knew that i would have to be extremely smart and a little crazy to reserve my seat on the next spaceship smoking i knew that rocky jones the jetsons and star trek were not possible without science and scientists
1753430 growing up in the 60s in key west florida i vividly recalled the excitement of the space program and the first moon landing by us astronauts the space program created a tremendous desire for math science and engineering training
1753431 the crisis that created the apollo program was sputnik the us was desperately concerned that the soviets would turn space into a weapon against this country kennedy galvanized the nation not around that fear but around a positive simple goal a man on the moon by the end of the decade of the 60s
1753432 they fire the imagination they have a very simple and specific objective that lets everyone know when the goal has been reached they cannot quite be reached with the current technology and require new technology to be invented along the way they take huge resources often combining government and private funding they are seen as compelling to our future people feel they are part of making history
1753433 it is my hope that our current leadership will learn to be as bold as kennedy by challenging todays youth to use stem to clean up the environment produce better alternatives to the internal combustion engine eliminate famine and cure disease
1753434 desde hace a os hablamos del peligro de extinci n de los primates pero ahora tenemos datos s lidos que muestran que
1753435 se al russel a mittermeier presidente del grupo especialista en primates de la comisi n de supervivencia de especies de la uicn y presidente de ci
1753436 la deforestaci n tropical siempre ha sido la causa principal pero ahora parece que la caza es una amenaza seria en algunas reas incluso aunque el h bitat siga intacto en muchos lugares los primates
1753437 entre las especies africanas siempre se ha puesto el foco en los grandes simios como los gorilas y los bonobos y aunque est n en un grav simo peligro resulta que los monos peque os como el colobo rojo pueden extinguirse antes
1753438 la argentina sufre mucho el tema f sico lo tratamos de contrarrestar con el control de pelota pero ellas son muy fuertes
1753439 estar ac es un logro pero hay que remarla mucho es lo que hay
1753440 tenemos la dimensi n de lo que implica abrir un juego ol mpico si bien jugamos en los mundiales con un marco importante de gente no estamos acostumbrados a sto
1753441 est todo definido de palabra con el jugador y con el club
1753442 es un jugador fuera de serie que adem s necesita ayuda
1753443 estoy muy feliz de salir he sido atendido muy bien
1753444 ha sido muy buena se retir por sus propios medios y ma ana jueves viaja a buenos aires porque continuar con el tratamiento en forma ambulatoria
1753445 either way you do it you have the option of installing fedora as a non destructive upgrade so if you already have files on a usb drive you can keep them while still turning the stick into a bootable drive
1753446 ellos quer an hacer estos secuestros para intercambiar la libertad de estas autoridades por la suya
1753447 me ped an 5 millones de d lares por la liberaci n de mi mujer
1753448 el ej rcito de liberaci n nacional solamente ha cometido en colombia secuestros extorsivos econ micos eso qu quiere decir que son familias comunes y corrientes familias n n manejando procesos individuales de negociaci n con el eln para tratar de traer con vida a su ser querido
1753449 el eln se comporta como un grupo secuestrador experto deja de llamar a las familias por obvias razones pues entre m s d as pasen m s angustia generan luego empieza el proceso de negociaci n en el que hay amenazas sobre la vida de la v ctima intimidaci n y sometimiento a la familia para tratar de lograr su cometido
1753450 esa es una de las grandes complejidades que tiene el secuestro del eln como es secuestro extorsivo econ mico la petici n la hace solamente de manera individual al grupo familiar que tiene el secuestrado en esa medida nos hemos puesto a visualizar los secuestros de este grupo guerrillero para que hagamos una gran campa a nacional para exigirles as como le estamos exigiendo a las farc que libere a todos los secuestrados
1753451 a suspender la retenci n o privaci n de la libertad de personas con prop sitos financieros en la medida que se resuelva por otros medios la suficiente disponibilidad de recursos para el eln tambi n a partir de hoy cesa la retenci n de menores de edad y de mayores de 65 a os y en ning n caso se privar de la libertad a mujeres embarazadas
1753452 el eln hist ricamente siempre que se ha acercado al gobierno ha dicho que va a dejar de secuestrar que no va a secuestrar menores ancianos pero en la pr ctica nunca se ha cumplido
1753453 utilizar el secuestro como instrumento para tratar de adoptar posiciones ventajosas atenta contra todos los tratados internacionales y contra el derecho internacional humanitario me parece que ese mecanismo esa forma de presionar no se puede admitir en ning n momento
1753454 el eln quiso hacer depender los di logos en que continuara el se or ch vez como mediador lo cual imposibilita esta circunstancia por la posici n del gobierno colombiano al haber manifestado que ch vez no puede seguir como mediador
1753455 en segundo lugar creo que el eln est haciendo depender un poco sus decisiones de lo que resuelva las farc
1753456 hay mucha gente que est trabajando por todos los secuestrados y en realidad la comisi n facilitadora que l compone trabaja en ese sentido
1753457 en los ltimos a os en colombia se les ha dado much sima relevancia a los secuestrados de las farc por obvias razones porque las farc tienen un n mero de secuestrados pol ticos en esa medida el secuestro pol tico requiere de un acuerdo entre el grupo secuestrador que en este caso son las farc con el gobierno por eso se le ha dado tanta relevancia
1753458 es un guerrero de al qaeda ha causado heridas y la gente con la que ha trabajado ha causado heridas al mundo
1753459 esta comisi n militar lo encuentra en el cargo n mero uno conspiraci n no culpable en el cargo dos respaldo material al terrorismo culpable
1753460 el respaldo material es un crimen de guerra la defensa cree que no
1753461 alg n d a atraparemos a osama bin laden ustedes no deber an castigar al chofer del general por los cr menes del general
1753462 se mantiene tan bien como cualquier cliente que haya tenido en esta etapa de los procedimientos
1753463 las declaraciones hechas en guant namo fueron permitidas como evidencia a pesar de informes de que hamdan hab a sido sujeto a una extensa privaci n del sue o acoso sexual y otros abusos
1753464 un juicio que depende de poner trabas a la defensa no puede ser justo
1753465 me estaban pidiendo 5 millones de d lares por la liberaci n de mi esposa
1753466 calle real actual carrera 7 y luego por el camino nuevo actual carrera 13 hasta chapinero
1753467 mientras que el 20 por ciento restante pertenec a al distrito
1753468 me estaban pidiendo 5 millones de d lares por la liberaci n de mi esposa
1753469 fue una especie de trampa seguramente ellos pretend an que yo reaccionara de alguna manera para poder justificar un acto m s vand lico
1753470 el grupo no puede ir m s all tampoco pues si el secuestrado se comporta mal pues mal ser la respuesta usted est conviviendo con unos colombianos con unos j venes alegres en cierta medida que soportan una cantidad de condiciones que de pronto no las soporta uno en condiciones normales termina siendo amigo de ellos porque uno comparte con esas personas y termina identific ndose en sus necesidades
1753471 por lo general usted no encuentra gente de m s de 20 a os de edad entre 15 y 20 a os
1753472 hab a una equivocaci n porque no hab a nada cierto sobre la muerte de este se or
1753473 nosotros le dec amos a antonio garc a que si el secuestro era econ mico como ya estaba comprobado que entendiera 5 millones de d lares qui n los tiene y si eran 5 millones de pesos si se equivocaba en su lenguaje pues que tambi n complicado por qu tener que transar a un ser humano una cantidad
1753474 hombre mire a ver como desarrolla la actividad necesaria porque nosotros no podemos ir m s la guerrilla la cuesti n pol tica la abandon y no tenemos manera de hablar con ellos de ah en adelante tuve que ir con la ayuda de dios con la ayuda de la iglesia y luego me toc solo
1753475 cada vez que ve amos una situaci n de esas al interior del grupo era m s el caos que se presentaba que se daba entonces seguramente muchas personas cog an por su lado negociaban cada una por su lado
1753476 pensando que no eran que aqu bucaramanga eran de otras partes entonces al principio una gran voluntad al principio un gran deseo hombre si vamos ayudar esto es una causa de todos como ahora
1753477 de 5 millones de d lares bajamos a 400 millones de pesos
1753478 de ser ciertas esas im genes demostrar n claramente un uso inapropiado del emblema lo que deploramos
1753479 ese video contiene material que fue infiltrado por el ej rcito y esa filtraci n fue producto de un acto de deslealtad e inclusive de traici n a la patria porque pone en riesgo a las personas que participaron en la operaci n
1753480 tenemos indicios de qui nes pudieron ser y nos vamos a cerciorar para no cometer ninguna injusticia
1753481 esa fue la verdad que se nos dijo en el momento en el que el presidente y yo informamos a la opini n p blica sobre el particular con el v deo de ayer se muestra que la realidad era diferente que el logo se utiliz en el comienzo de la operaci n
1753482 el gobierno siempre trata de otorgar las informaciones de la manera m s oportuna a todos los medios de comunicaci n no culpamos a rcn sino a la persona que filtr esa informaci n
1753483 de manera clandestina y sin coordinaci n con sus superiores
1753484 grave que en las primeras investigaciones sobre la operaci n no haya salido a relucir toda la verdad
1753485 el presidente reitera la necesidad de permitir que todos los medios de comunicaci n tengan igual y oportuno acceso a las noticias m s importantes
1753486 that is one of the ones you can believe in the papers he is one of his the managers major targets but there are others who have not made the papers yet thankfully
1753487 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1753488 would like the company to build another car in the mould of the lotus carlton
1753489 i cant believe how difficult it was to leave crystal palace
1753490 ive supported them my whole life and will always love the club
1753491 but when we thought about the bigger picture it seemed like i might get a better football education at spurs and we felt that was the most important thing
1753492 spurs showed me the development plan they have in place for me and i was seriously impressed
1753493 they will train me hard and develop my strengths and weaknesses in equal measure which will hopefully turn me into a key player for their first team in the next few years
1753494 look this can actually tow somthing over a 500 lbs
1753495 we are committed to reduce co2 emissions heavily in the next years so we are doing whatever is possible without destroying the dna of the brand to bring them down to a much better level than today
1753496 but you have to understand it will never meet the 120 g or 130 g per km
1753497 since marques like ferrari and maserati lamborghini and porsche are actually owned by larger companies fiat and vw respectively the eu lumps their production with their larger parent companies
1753498 it is stabilised but not at all under control we dont think it will be extinguished until tomorrow
1753499 theres a certain aura to the name and a good bit of nostalgia
1753500 we sure would like to see someone bring the packard name back into the marketplace
1753501 i am satisfied that we managed to improve the result despite a drop in sales
1753502 i wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast for i intend to go in harms way
1753503 we know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm
1753504 a war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1753505 what would everyone else think if you got to take off every friday
1753506 fue la decisi n m s dif cil que tom
1753507 no s lo ha negado los hechos sino que ha dado explicaciones coherentes y cre bles sobre su participaci n en el caso en el cual fue involucrado
1753508 el tobillo est mejor de lo que pens que iba a estar a esta altura
1753509 el tobillo est mucho mejor de lo que pens que iba a estar a esta altura
1753510 lo que les digo es que disfruten el ambiente de los juegos que es nico y excitante
1753511 esto es impresionante no hab a venido nunca y es incre ble c mo los chinos construyeron esto l stima que nos haya tocado un d a con tanta niebla porque me hubiese gustado ver mejor

1753513 esto es terrible f sicamente hay que estar muy preparado para subir y bajar de ac me parece que el entrenamiento de esta tarde arranca a las 5 y termina a las 5 y media
1753514 no vamos a pagar los desaguisados del gobierno cordob s

1753516 no est de acuerdo con el plante de c rdoba
1753517 el gobierno nacional no est dispuesto a pagar los desaguisados que hizo el gobierno provincial
1753518 se generaron jubilaciones irregulares sin aportes y anticipadas eso provoc un d ficit del que tiene que hacerse cargo la provincia

1753540 of course a closer examination of the study is less startling but still fascinating researchers asked two sets of subjects to take iq tests one group had to check e mail and respond to instant messages while taking the test the second group just sat down and did the test without distractions surprise surprise the distracted group didnt do as well on the test 10 points worse than the control group in similar testing conditions people intoxicated by marijuana had scores 8 points lower so researchers drew attention to their study by noting that multitasking is worse for your ability to concentrate than getting stoned

1753549 the board of lonmin notes the unsolicited pre conditional offer announced this morning by xstrata for the entire issued share capital of lonmin at 3 300 pence per share in cash
1753550 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1753551 lonmins operations have consistently underperformed its own forecasts on expected platinum sales and have been subject to a declining sales and production profile at a time of robust prices
1753552 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices are required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1753553 only for short term investors and market timers is a correction not an opportunity
1753554 continues to struggle as it lacks sufficient scale product quality and properly targeted titles to capitalize on the current industry profile
1753555 does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years

1753559 i dont think that picking anybody thats had a commodity thats increased in price a lot and saying that theres a special tax because of that makes any sense

1753561 if you heard a rumor that i covered myself in fake tattoos and played guitar hero until 3 a m this weekend that rumor is true i rocked it

1753563 ill cover myself in sailor tattoos and dress like a rock star everyone else dresses totally normally and must think im a complete freak
1753564 thanks for holding the bus for me while i ran across the street to catch it
1753565 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt patrol torpedo boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
1753566 er zijn een dozijn idee n aangeboden over hoe een oorlog uit te lokken het idee dat mij het meest interesseerde was waarom bouwen wij niet in onze scheepswerf vier of vijf op irans gelijkende pt boten zet er zwaar bewapende mariniers op en wanneer n van onze boten naar de straat van hormuz gaat een vuurgevecht te beginnen
1753567 gersten habe ich in magazine gelesen dass china eigentlich ein gross seefahren nation ist
1753568 87 jahre frueher als kolubum war ein grosse chinesche flotte schon quer ueber dem ozean gesegelt und bis sogar afrika
1753569 das chinesische schiff war sehr groess wie flott palast gut konstruktiv mehr als 100 meter lang
1753570 es sollte so sein die flotte umfasst 240 schiffe und 27400 matrose
1753571 fragte ich ich fand es sehr merkmuerdig dass irgend welche deutsche zeitschrift daueber berichtete china war fuer deutsch eher sache an rand

1753580 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks
1753581 then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
1753582 in an effort to cast himself as independent of the influence of money on politics senator barack obama often highlights the campaign contributions of 200 or less that have amounted to fully half of the 340 million he has collected so far but records show that one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr obamas republican rival or senator hillary rodham clinton his opponent in the democratic primaries raised in contributions of that size behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington given his decision not to accept public financing mr obama is counting on his bundlers to help him raise 300 million for his general election campaign and another 180 million for the democratic national committee an analysis of campaign finance records shows that about two thirds of his bundlers are concentrated in four major industries law securities and investments real estate and entertainment

1753586 the survey also found that 10 percent of senior marketers said their organizations have had an implicit non verbal agreement with a reporter or editor that anticipated favorable coverage of their company or products in exchange for advertising
1753587 without full disclosure and transparency media lose credibility and their value as an unbiased source of information
1753588 following ethical guidelines in new media more than they did a year ago
1753589 first the implications of the science are frightening shifting to renewable energy will be costly and disruptive second doubt is an easy product to sell climate denial tells us what we all secretly want to hear third science is portrayed as political orthodoxy rather than objective knowledge a curiously postmodern argument
1753590 there are no smoke free areas on the planet climate denial may turn out to be the worlds most deadly pr campaign
1753591 we believe it is essential to weaken this link to neutralize the diabetes hyperglycemia issue neutralizing any concern from our customers will be essential to the future growth of zyprexa in the marketplace
1753592 we will not proactively address the diabetes concern the competition wins if we are distracted into talking about diabetes
1753593 if one looks at most of the vital disclosures of the last seven years whereby concealed legally dubious behavior of one of the most secretive administrations of the modern era is exposed one finds that such exposure comes overwhelmingly from two sources 1 conscientious whistle blowers inside the government and 2 advocacy groups such as the aclu which have tirelessly waged one litigation battle after the next in order to unearth the bush administrations secret improper conduct
1753594 the record of the establishment press over the last seven years is one characterized far more by failure and complicity than by real journalism the function of the aclu and similar groups isnt really to uncover illegal behavior on the part of our government that is the intended function of the congress the media and the opposition party but those institutions havent done that as a result the aclu and similar groups with far fewer resources have been forced first to uncover what the government does to try methodically and incrementally to erode the governments wall of secrecy to perform real journalism in order then to engage in their real function of opposing government encroachments and defending the constitution basic privacy rights and civil liberties

1753622 it is not too surprising that oil prices have retreated from the lofty highs of more than 140 a barrel reached in july energy consumption is falling and americans the worlds most avid gas guzzlers have finally responded by driving about 10 billion miles less in may than they did during the same month in 2007 but unfortunately across the developing world governments are subsidizing energy blunting the incentive to conserve by keeping prices low venezuela and egypt are forecast to spend more than 5 of their total economic output on subsidies this year and indonesia almost as much while demand for oil in the rich world is expected to fall about 1 this year consumption in emerging and developing countries is forecast to rise 3 governments in developing countries say they must shield the poor from high energy prices they worry that eliminating subsidies might lead to inflation but these subsidies are misguided and mainly benefit the well off who own big cars and fly in jets as well as energy intensive industries which are not usually those that create most jobs oil subsidies are expensive sucking in public money that might be better used on health care or education and they get costlier as the price of oil rises subsidies are a big factor keeping world oil prices high outside of the middle east and some parts of texas this is in nobodys interest

1753624 southern californias long term plans to generate electricity to serve a growing population and to replace out dated dirty plants were thrown into disarray tuesday when a la county superior court judge ruled that local authorities had failed to do the necessary environmental and health analyses the proposed gas fired plants which include 11 in the los angeles basin and two in the outlying areas of desert hot springs and victorville would be built by private companies which would sell the power to southern california edison and other utilities but under the federal clean air act no polluting facilities can be built unless emissions are reduced elsewhere in the region through offsets years ago the air district set aside what it called priority reserve credits so that projects such as hospitals and police stations could be built even if they added to the regions pollution last year the district lobbied by a host of former politicians decided to sell the credits to energy companies for 420 million about half the market value according to environmentalists calculations environmental and community groups said wednesday that they would sue in federal court to nullify such credits the decision meanwhile left air regulators perplexed at their next move barry wallerstein the air districts executive officer said the region needs about 2 000 megawatts of new capacity and that sufficient offsets are unavailable on the open market the la county superior courts decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by the communities for a better environment and other groups in it judge ann i jones told the air district it could not sell offsets to the plants without a fuller analysis under californias environmental quality act in particular the judge said the district needed to analyze exactly how many tons of pollutants including greenhouse gases each proposed plant would emit

1753630 christopher blansett an analyst with j p morgan says the solar industry would start seeing the effects of congressional delay on the 30 solar tax credit extension in the fourth quarter since potential larger commercial solar system installations would likely not be started if they cant be assured to reach completion by the end of the subsidiary period on december 31 although renewal is probable near term demand concern is likely to continue to put investors on edge and solar energy stocks under pressure blansett writes some large projects have already been delayed due to the uncertainty in the federal subsidy other industry players now think that a renewal of the solar tax credit program isnt likely to occur until a new president takes office which could means a longer period of uncertainty for the industry

1753632 there is one potential future energy source that is environmentally friendly has essentially unlimited potential and can be cost competitive with any renewable source space solar power a space solar power system would involve building large solar energy collectors in orbit around the earth that would collect far more energy than land based units once collected the solar energy would be safely beamed to earth via wireless radio transmission where it would be received by antennas near places requiring large amounts of power it would then be converted to electric power for distribution over the existing grid the two stumbling blocks have been the expense of launching the collectors and the efficiency of their solar cells fortunately the recent development of thinner lighter and much higher efficiency solar cells promises to make sending them into space less expensive and return of energy much greater still because construction of the first system will be very costly a practical first step would be to conduct a test using the space station to house the astronauts and equipment helping to prove the concept over the past 15 years americans have invested more than 100 billion directly and indirectly in the space station and supporting shuttle flights with an energy crisis deepening its time to begin to develop a huge return on that investment

1754179 the hurriyat wanted to carry the people of jammu along in the movement but now demands have risen from their about a separate state
1754180 the hindu population in jammu is limited to two and a half districts and two and a half districts cannot be allowed to hold the entire state hostage
1754181 if the hindu population of jammu does not want to side with our movement and wants to separate the hurriyat will have no objection it the hindu population of jammu must be allowed to part ways
1754182 we had never wanted this but we can no longer remain silent after the way hindu extremists have targeted the muslims in jammu

1754208 one of these genes manufactures a transporter for the neurotransmitter dopamine a second manufactures a receptor for it a third makes a transporter for the neurotransmitter serotonin two more make receptors or serotonin three other genes implicated in antisocial behaviors manufacture enzymes the first makes the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase he second makes the enzyme catechol o methyltransferase comt he third makes the enzyme monoamine oxidase maoa
1754209 located on the x chromosome maoa beaks down the neurotransmitters dopamine norepinephrine nd serotonin rendering them inactive a long version of the gene produces a lot of enzyme activity a short version of the ene produces little and deficiencies in the maoa gene have een linked with aggression in both mice and humans
1754210 increased aggression was observed in mice in which the entire aoa gene was deleted the aggression abated upon restoration of the gene
1754211 boys who had been abused and had the short gene variant constituted only 12 percent of the entire cohort but they accounted for 44 percent of the cohorts convictions for violent acts furthermore of the boys who had been severely abused and who possessed the short gene variant 85 percent engaged in some form of antisocial behavior
1754212 even when the short maoa gene variant was not present
1754213 heritability influences antisocial behaviors more when parenting is negative and cold than when it is positive and warm
1754214 in studies of heritability the proportion of the variance of antisocial behavior that can be attributed to genetic effects is 50 percent and the other 50 percent is explained by environmental influences

1754247 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1754248 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1754249 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1754250 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1754251 nicotina obra rec procamente con una variedad de caminos neuroqu3imicos dentro del cerebro para producir su rewarding y los efectos adictivos
1754252 sin embargo durante la fase temprana de exposici n del tabaco muchos individuos encuentran la nicotina altamente desagradable y aversiva mientras que otros pueden hacer r pidamente dependiente en la nicotina y encontrarla que recompensa altamente quisimos explorar esa diferencia
1754253 mientras que mucho progreso se ha hecho en la comprensi n de c mo el cerebro procesa los efectos rewarding de la nicotina despu s de que se establezca la dependencia muy peque o se sabe sobre c mo el sistema mesolimbic de la dopamina puede controlar la vulnerabilidad inicial a la nicotina es decir porqu haga algunos individuos se envician r pidamente a la nicotina mientras que no lo hacen otros y en algunos casos incluso nicotina del hallazgo para ser altamente aversivos

1754266 she suffered a fractured wrist and bruising to her legs she was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been released
1754267 the woman was very lucky she was not more seriously injured the third rail carries 750 volts of electricity and she could have been electrocuted or even struck by an early morning train

1754272 i hadnt been on a bike in 35 years i said youve got to be kidding
1754273 a big happy family and all the memories of riding together
1754274 an eagle is his symbol and we always see eagles on the ride
1754275 first bar on the right unless its on the left
1754276 i was riding 11 miles an hour but that bullfly thats what i call em was doing 34 he just kept buzzing around me
1754277 then i found other things to be interested in girls and hunting and fishing
1754278 we are going to play a lot of people and see how they perform under game conditions see how they do with the speed of the game which im sure will be a surprise to a lot of these young guys its a turf game its an indoor game see how they are under the pressure of having to execute assignments how quickly they can react to what the opponent is doing be very conscious of who it is that is contributing on special teams and how they might be used going forward to start on some of the objectives that were put forth in the offseason to our players in terms of our improvement to assess each and every time we play but a big personnel type of evaluation i dont think there will be any mystery about how we play im not sure what detroit will have in mind
1754279 everybody is always looking forward to getting into a game situation
1754280 i think you learn from every practice and every game that you play in this game will help us get back into game speed and will help me get back to throwing under pressure getting the ball off on time and getting used to taking the hits you know guys are coming after you and youre going to get hit knocked down hopefully not too often but its going to happen its not a bad thing because it will help you get back into form
1754281 were tired of hitting each other im tired of seeing brandon jacobs derrick ward ahmad bradshaw and eli i want to hit someone else for once you just want to get out there and compete and the only thing weve done at that kind of level was goal line and thats not realistic the offensive line has the ball at the two yard line and they didnt have to do any work for it it will be good to go out there against another team detroit has a lot of weapons and were excited to go out there and play weve got new faces on the defense so itll be good to see the guys working well together in a game situation
1754282 i dont get bogged down with all that its just a little asterisk next to your name that says youre a starter now other than that you continue to go out there and do what you did up until now its still the same
1754283 obviously we wont play a whole game but for the plays we are out there were going to take it like its the super bowl
1754284 im tired of having to go out there and tag off on eli and running by quarterbacks and hitting running backs on the butt its going to be fun its good to get out there get up field and hit somebody in a different uniform im looking forward to it
1754285 i want to bring somebody to the ground make a big hit and make my teammates go wow thats the way i play i play with a lot of intensity and aggression thats why i probably got into that scuffle with rich seubert the other day im going a little too hard on my teammates i look forward to going against an opponent
1754286 i think the first preseason game kind of starts the season
1754287 over the years ive learned that games are nothing like practice you just have to get yourself ready for speed and for all the movements and all that stuff
1754288 im excited i get to play a football game and then have a kid
1754289 its probably going to be one of the best weekends ive ever had
1754290 im really excited about the game i have some new toys to play with i have a few moves ive been working on im excited because im trying to make the transition from last year to this year and like to think im making it and its just a work in progress
1754291 i think bryan kehl has had a really good camp
1754292 i cant wait for the game im so excited i cant even describe it im pumped this is the real deal this is why we come to training camp to play the games i cant wait to get out there and hopefully make some tackles knock down a ball and get a sack whatever
1754293 i remember my first college game it was august 29 2002 against syracuse university and i remember it like it was yesterday i remember coming out of the tunnel as an 18 year old wide eyed freshman and ill never forget that until the day i die it will be the same for my first preseason game and first regular season game its something i always looked forward to and when you get there in college it was signing the letter of intent yeah that was cool then it was getting drafted yeah that was cool but when you get to the game thats where it all happens and the magic begins
1754294 theyre both really smart so theyve picked up the defense
1754295 they can learn in the classroom and then go out and apply it on the field which is really encouraging they both can run and bryan can really run hes a really good athlete which is what we thought when we drafted him even in the padded practices weve had even though we dont technically scrimmage and tackle theyve demonstrated that theyre both going to be physical you know theyll come up and punch blockers and get off blocks and that kind of stuff i think both him and jon are going to be excellent players i really do theyre showing to be good picks
1754296 i talked to him the other day and he completely understands
1754297 hes a guy thats got a lot of talent and each year as you have new guys coming into the defense and you know we lost three of our starters in the super bowl its important for guys like him to step up and play better than just okay and he understands that because hes a very talented player and we are counting on him to not just be a starter but a productive starter so yes im excited and im sure he is too he wont play a whole lot thursday but im sure hes itching to get out there

1754301 ill treatment and torture of detainees were systematically used during the conflict but it would be wrong for us to think that their use ceased after the conflict ended or even that it did not occur before the conflict in many parts of the country these violations of human rights continue in places of detention thus ending ill treatment and torture remains as important today as it has ever been
1754302 the state has an obligation to make torture a criminal offence and to encourage investigation and prosecution of acts of torture however it is not enough to have a good legal framework the law must be implemented and established patterns of behaviour have to be changed this requires commitment from those in positions of authority and the tireless efforts of civil society
1754303 yeah we dont want muslims feeling persecuted so lets teach all children about islam right here in the public school system

1754362 basically the seals foolishly poke their heads through holes in the ice from time to time so they can breathe sometimes there is a polar bear sitting next to the hole and when that happens the seal gets its skull bashed in by a huge bear claw the polar bear then eats the seals skin and blubber and usually throws the rest of the seal away allowing eskimos to harvest the seal remains and sell them to fast food restaurants in the united states so you can imagine the devastating effect global warming will have on the u s food supply if polar bears cant hunt due to melting sea ice
1754363 there are seals there but the polar bears are far more likely to gobble up emperor penguin birds which are fat plump and juicy
1754364 in addition the birds congregate together far away from the antarctic sea where they could escape from the bear they are also slow and stand out against the snow and ice the emperor penguins will be massacred but the good news is that the polar bears will not starve to death and we wont have to sadly watch them float on chunks of sea ice
1754365 we estimate that by 2028 the polar bears will have chewed their way through all the available food sources in antarctica

1754537 patients have the right to timely access to acute care services and governments have a responsibility to provide it this means a commitment must be made for maximum allowable waits for treatment
1754538 the only way to achieve this is to increase the number of acute care beds provide the necessary resources to support those beds and do a better job of managing them than we currently do

1754546 pcs are the hidden energy hogs of the home and most users have no idea that they are needlessly throwing away 80 percent of their pcs energy
1754547 if just 1 percent of all pcs used edison we could potentially reduce environmental impacts by 7 billion pounds of co2 which is equal to taking more than a half million cars off the road by finding ways to embed offsets in our daily life even something as simple as downloading software we will create permanent reductions in energy use and have a huge impact on our environment and resource sustainability
1754548 microsoft is committed to forging partnerships and developing innovative software solutions and services that enable people and organizations to reduce their impact on the environment
1754549 we are pleased to collaborate with verdiem and climate savers computing to introduce edison a free pc energy management solution with a proven enterprise pc energy management solution surveyor verdiem has demonstrated the ability to deliver excellent customer solutions and now with edison consumers can reduce their household greenhouse gas emissions and control energy costs
1754550 recent studies predict pc ownership will quadruple to 4 billion and double emissions by 2020 1 so implementing pc energy management solutions at home and in the workplace is a vital component of climate protection
1754551 tools like edison can help consumers control and monitor their pcs energy intake and make a real difference in the way they manage the power consumption of the technology they use
1754552 we are particularly pleased with our http small packet and latency performance as these are areas that present many technical challenges for designers
1754553 as we look to scale beyond 10gbps the real power of our software centers on the fact that the same suite of software libraries can also scale down to sub 200mbps applications while supporting a common api feature set and integration cycle
1754554 there is no single metric which clearly defines a product winner in the security and networking applications space this is why at sensory we have been developing technology to cover small packet performance latency throughput connections per second supported rule count and pcre compatibility
1754555 collectively hyperscan and fastchannel software are the first of their kind to deliver on these types of performance parameters needed for applications such as ips
1754556 the device under test we used for the benchmarking was tested to have a routing limit of 11 12 gbps
1754557 by using hyperscan and fastchannel software we have pushed snort ips udp and http throughput performance close to this limit the results also show that hyperscans pattern matching alone provides an incremental 60 gain in throughput above and beyond the gains achieved using fastchannel

1754648 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1754649 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending

1754742 the terrible news of the marti youngster has overshadowed the execution in texas last night of a mexican
1754743 there is no reason for outrage the man was a rapist
1754744 if we had the death penalty here there wouldnt be so many crimes
1754745 there are those who see this as an opportunity to call for a return to the death penalty
1754746 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1754747 this is another murder because no one has the right to take someone elses life only god
1754748 you do think was that on purpose or was that an accident

1754772 the legislature has reduced property taxes by approximately one third over the past few years but has not provided funding for annual step raises and mandated staffing teacher increases
1754773 the return on investment to the taxpayer is incredible and until the legislature changes the funding formula districts across the state are out of necessity going to ask the taxpayers to invest in the future of the local schools
1754774 palmer isd has the third lowest combined tax rate in ellis county it is like a double edged sword said oakley we all appreciate low taxes but providing a quality education to our students simply costs more than what we are currently receiving in state funding and in local taxes the state requires we hire additional personnel but does not provide the funding necessary to get the job done
1754775 ig was going off and the montreal people were pumped up
1754776 either non existent or burdensome while showing positive depictions of extra marital or adulterous sexual relationships with alarming frequency
1754777 these study results suggest that many in hollywood are actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently showing it in a negative manner
1754778 throughout much of the history of broadcast television the networks adhered to a voluntary code of conduct which stipulated that respect should be maintained for the sanctity of marriage and the value of the home our report finds that not only are the boundaries no longer respected they have been obliterated
1754779 theres the expectation that television is some reflection of reality reality television isnt even a reflection of reality
1754780 have these people been living in a cave i mean pre marital sex extra martial sex its not like this is new to television its been around for a while
1754781 the thing i find encouraging is a lot of these shows are going beyond that and reinforcing non traditional families with single parents or same sex parents
1754782 broadcasters knowing televisions ability to influence behavior must exercise greater responsibility when handling sexual situations during primetime hours opting for less graphic visual content and favoring storylines that dont celebrate promiscuity glamorize criminality or denigrate monogamy

1754792 the headwinds today make this a more challenging fund raising environment
1754793 the results reflect the dire environment that these guys are trying to perform in
1754794 the stock has been decimated so when the results are a little less crummy than expected that gets reflected in the stock most of the factors of the bad environment have been baked into the stock already

1754803 on the listing side it has not been a good year for ipos
1754804 the flip side is that these fees have a cost
1754805 originators are the ones that have to pay these up front fees and the originators need to be compensated they most likely will turn around to the borrowers and factor those higher fees into higher mortgage rates
1754806 whats the effect all else being equal it has the effect of pushing mortgage rates higher which is not exactly conducive to generating new business
1754807 the adverse market delivery charge increase addresses continuing market deterioration and the updated loan level price adjustments reflect our continual monitoring and ongoing efforts to fine tune the alignment of price with risk
1754808 fannie mae is announcing these changes to better align pricing with credit risks mitigate losses and support fannie maes ability to provide a stable source of liquidity to lender partners
1754809 lives up to its reputation as one of the most solid banks in europe
1754810 thanks to its highly diversified earnings streams the bank is in a better position to absorb financial market stress than many of its peers
1754811 credit related expenses were far higher than what guidance had been
1754812 we have to prepare for a stress condition that looks worse than that
1754813 todays challenging economic environment suggests that the housing market is far from stabilizing
1754814 we now think that we are halfway through the overall peak to trough decline
1754815 either investors are going to be massively diluted given the amount of equity they are going to need or they are going to be nationalized
1754816 without a larger equity capital base they are going to be incapable of surviving we dont think 5 5 billion even scratches the surface
1754817 what this organization is all about is balancing among the different missions
1754818 we thought that was the right judgment to make given the information we had at that point in time
1754819 we decided to give up market share rather than to chase it
1754820 when the entire marketplace is seeing things one way we cant unilaterally say were going to see things another way
1754821 the nissan altima hybrid combines impressive fuel economy with much of the same sporty character that has helped establish the altimas reputation as one of the most fun to drive mid size sedans
1754822 harrison square is just a piece of the puzzle a big expensive piece but something that if handled right can be leveraged to help local businesses establish a presence downtown
1754823 its simply an opportunity for us to do the match making and do the kind of granular kind of work you need to do to get good entrepreneurs local and unique entrepreneurial kinds of businesses into our downtown street fronts to make the case for downtown as the regions premier office center
1754824 you have fantastic amenities downtown youve got places where singles can live a tremendous ball park you can walk to a great bike system those are the kind of things that can help fort wayne elevate its position as a competitor in the global market place everybody is so concerned about
1754825 anyone concerned with her fiscal and physical well being should find car advice for women and smart men of great value
1754826 we filled car advice for women with information that would help people who already have a car as well as tips for people looking for a new one
1754827 so its more of a users guide than a buyers guide
1754828 some of the safety tips will be familiar seatbelts and so on
1754829 but many of them may come as a surprise to readers for example most women dont know theyre in danger because they sit way too close to the steering wheel or because they leave objects lying around loose in the car and almost no pregnant women think about the risks to their unborn children theyre creating by simply being in a moving car
1754830 following any one of several pieces of our advice will enable you to earn back the cost of our book
1754831 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1754832 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september
1754833 we would preferred a clear yes but its more complicated than that as we all know
1754834 we are committed to doing everything we can to make this process work
1754835 i can tell you the prime minister is cool hes doing the work that needs to be done i see him conducting the business of government in an ongoing way
1754836 its an internal israeli matter as far as were concerned but at the end of the day as palestinians we want to make peace with all israelis not with this party or that person
1754837 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs and the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1754838 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1754839 i know this that the six party talks is the best way to convince them to give up their weapons
1754840 and as to what kind of behavior north korea will take whats most important is number one is that we must have a denuclearization of north korea
1754841 so i will be patient i will be consistent and i will do my best
1754842 and theres no place on earth that more clearly demonstrates the contrast between free and open societies and repressive closed societies than the korean peninsula
1754843 no better place to see an example between the beauty of freedom and the hope of freedom and the difficulties with repressive and closed societies and south korea takes its rightful place on the world stage north korea traps its people in misery and isolation
1754844 the united states and thailand are working to expand freedom with good governance
1754845 i want to thank you very much and congratulate the people of thailand for restoring its democracy
1754846 we think that youve seen a fair and transparent process in which journalists were on hand allowed to see the process in which the defendant was offered a vigorous defense by his counsel in which the prosecutor was able to make his case
1754847 it was a good first effort or so it seems at this point and we hope it is the beginning of at least 20 additional trials that will hopefully take place sooner than later down there
1754848 i dont think theres any way you could characterize it as a fair and open process
1754849 i think the verdict in this trial was in before the trial even started
1754850 the military commissions lack such fundamental due process guarantees that we dont think that hamdan ever actually had a chance to have a fair trial
1754851 there is still a significant population within guantanamo who will likely never be released because of the threat they pose to the world for that matter
1754852 if somebody is too dangerous to release i dont think it should be too hard to find out why gather information and build a case against them and charge them
1754853 were not a country that holds people indefinitely without charge it so fundamentally opposes american values
1754854 hes a great operations guy and qualcomm is a great training ground
1754855 but im surprised they did not pick someone with more imagination in devices im not sure whether a semiconductor guy does the trick can he green light the next five great devices consumers want
1754856 but i would not have taken this job if i did not believe in the organization

1754873 in the past few years many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home
1754874 it says we make enough money that we both dont need to work outside the home

1754885 the first is landfill but there you lose the land and the waste and it pollutes ground water
1754886 the second is incineration but that leaves over fly ash and bottom ash in huge quantities bottom ash is incinerated again and can eventually be used for construction
1754887 our process is a chemical one not burning the waste is reduced to 4 percent of its mass which can then become construction building blocks ninety six percent turns into gas which powers the plant itself

1754899 i was nervous enough carrying the flag for england at the commonwealth games in kuala lumpur in 1998 so i cant imagine what i will feel like here when the moment comes i am very aware that i am following in some very illustrious footsteps indeed

1754914 my son loves his daughter very much i shower all my love and affection on this baby tears keep rolling down my cheeks all the time

1754937 recent data suggested that the slowdown has taken a firmer hold of the economy and the olympics may present some downside risks
1754938 as the domestic and external uncertainties rise worries about a sharper than expected economic slowdown loom large and the government has changed its tone on macro policy recently
1754939 as weve said before we have no plans to utilize the temporary authorities that has not changed this action should be interpreted as a prudent preparedness measure and nothing more

1754944 i think the market is probably taking a little bit out of the tightening probabilities
1754945 i think the consensus is the fed will probably be at 2 percent for some time now
1754946 i think if anything the tilt of the fed announcement was a little bit more toward the weakness in the economy than most had expected that may have been the only surprise
1754947 that probably might have been part of the reassurance for the bond market
1754948 probably the best hope that everybody has is that oil and commodity prices will come down fast enough to take the pressure off inflation
1754949 i think treasurys have been fairly resilient considering how well the stock market has done today but what were seeing is pressure in the 10 and 30 year sector where the supply is going to be in the next two days
1754950 people were encouraged by what cisco had to say theres a different mind set even though the freddie mac news was pretty bleak

1754953 i still think there will be more problems not only with fannie and freddie but also with a number of banks

1754967 i feel about airplanes the way i feel about diets it seems to me that they are wonderful things for other people to go on
1754968 the one way to get thin is to re establish a purpose in life
1754969 avoid any diet that discourages the use of hot fudge
1754970 the biggest seller is cookbooks and the second is diet books how not to eat what youve just learned how to cook
1754971 gluttony is an emotional escape a sign something is eating us

1754977 as for food half of my friends have dug their graves with their teeth

1754984 microsoft developed this release of sql server with the customer in mind
1754985 sql server 2008 is the only major database that includes comprehensive tightly integrated functionality for data management as well as advanced business intelligence out of the box by offering a complete solution we save customers time and money and allow them to focus on deriving the most value from their data assets
1754986 we selected sql server 2008 because we can entrust it with our critical business applications sql server 2008 is highly secure and reliable and offers the best value on the market today in addition it accelerates the time frame for deploying new features and enhancements and that to us makes sql server a winner
1754987 microsoft is one of the only vendor s with top enterprise search and business intelligence reporting capabilities it offers strong support for aggregation summarization search engine and dashboards transactions across distributed data sources and long running transactions are also strengths for microsoft
1754988 we saw a 35 percent improvement in throughput on the system that we upgraded to sql server 2008 with no code changes on our end
1754989 this translates straight to the bottom line for us as the more documents we can upload the more we can process
1754990 we dont have any negotiations with any large companies at this time

1754999 el a o para el deporte espa ol ha sido fant stico venimos con humildad sabiendo lo dif cil que es conseguir lo que hemos hecho ser dif cil repetir una temporada como sta a veces cuando ocurre esto nos acostumbramos demasiado a las victorias y dejamos de valorarlas nos olvidamos de lo complicado que ha sido
1755000 nadie piensa en los puntos que hay en juego para el circuito sino en representar a un pa s y conseguir una medalla para tu pa s
1755001 para m el n mero uno es un triunfo bonito pero no tengo tiempo de disfrutarlo porque estoy en los juegos y esta es una experiencia nica y ahora s lo pienso en intentar hacerlo lo mejor posible
1755002 insisti la raqueta espa ola que apenas ha tenido tiempo de descansar especialmente en los ltimos meses
1755003 el calendario de este a o es terror fico no he tenido tiempo de descanso s lo una semana despu s de wimbledon es un a o duro y dif cil y espero que los d as de entrenamiento sean suficientes para afrontar la competici n tengo que asimilar un cambio horario de 12 horas pero los ltimos esfuerzos de la temporada son aqu y en estados unidos porque despu s la temporada vuelve a europa
1755004 how do i insulate the heated cooled floor and walls of a boathouse the floor is constructed of wood trusses located twenty four inches o c and the knee wall is constructed of 2x6 24in o c also should i consider any other sound proofing
1755005 i just purchased a house that was built over 90 years ago there is no insulation in the crawlspace currently and there is very limited access under 2 ft i would like to add to insulation some other way to the floor my question is can i install a rigid insulation on top of the existing floor which is pine planking and then cover it with 5 8 osb and then my final finish layer the height needed to do this would not be a problem if this would work do i need to install a moisture barrier between any of the layers any recommendations would be appreciated
1755006 i am going to finish out an unfinished room over garage and i have a question about insulating the floor there is a large hole in one corner of the room that allows the ng hot water heater vent to go to the roof and from looking in that hole i have found that there is no insulation in the floor the subfloor is already down and the garage ceiling is drywalled i would like to avoid ripping up the subfloor if at all possible because there is framing for the knee walls attached to the subfloor as well as some temporary supports for the roof ridge what would be the best way to insulate the floor so that all the heat from the garage doesnt make the frog unbearably hot
1755007 some independently owned small to medium size chains have been selling extensive lines of local seasonal fruits and vegetables for years lines they are now expanding for the largest supermarket chains though where for decades produce has meant truckloads transported primarily from the west coast its not always easy to switch to the farmer down the road but soaring transportation costs not to mention the cachet customers attach to local food have made it more attractive not just to supermarkets but to the agribusiness companies that supply them growers like dole and nunes have contracted with farmers in the east to grow products like broccoli and leafy greens that they used to ship from the west coast because of fuel costs in some instances the cost of freight is more than the cost of the products
1755008 our research tells us consumers have about five or six reasons for wanting local freshness and taste keeping farmland in the community and having open spaces a desire to be close to the food source and know where it comes from support of local farmers and keeping money in the community embedded in all of this is concern about food safety all this creates pretty powerful interest
1755009 if we do have children it would be with great reluctance on my part
1755010 the expanded product range allows us to better meet customers specific requirements in a variety of applications
1755011 with a universal slot design and module formats measuring 5mm deep by 75mm long the connectors and cover sets enable both 34mm and 54mm express cards to fit in the same aperture allowing us to also provide customers with a component count savings
1755012 we will this year sign an agreement with a chinese funding institution to get a us 25 million concession to expand our network to rural areas we are also focusing our attention on expanding the optic fibre network to provincial capitals namely tete pemba and lichinga by the end of this year
1755013 the advantages of curved detector surface imaging have been understood by optics designers for a long time and by biologists for an even longer time
1755014 thats how the human eye works using the curved surface at the back of the eye to capture an image
1755015 in a conventional planar camera parts of the images that fall at the edges of the fields of view are typically not imaged well using simple optics

1755241 talent acquisition strategies employer branding and quality of hire take center stage
1755242 top performing organizations are more effective at identifying the traits of their top performing employees in order to seek more like them
1755243 however a successful talent acquisition program involves far more than deciding what skills and attributes are needed from candidates and finding new sources for them it also involves the ability to measure and assess how well new hires perform in their roles during the first year on the job this is where quality of hire is really determined

1755247 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
1755248 your comment regarding a higher power or unalienable rights being referred to in the bill of rights is i think misplaced i think what youre referring to is the declaration of independence
1755249 no i said that the concept behind unalienable rights from the founding fathers was that a higher power gives us natural rights natural law and therefore government has no right to take those things away from us
1755250 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
1755251 well i would only say that i think the natural law that youre referring to that jefferson referred to when drafting the declaration he was referring to john locke in natural law
1755252 i thought your reference to the bill of rights i may have misheard it but i thought you said that our own bill of rights incorporated the higher law concept which they do not actually the only reference to religion in the bill of rights is in the first amendment which says congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of a religion
1755253 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
1755254 yeah what i meant was that it flows from that concept then if you want and by the way if youre an irreligious person if youre an atheist or an agnostic and you you want to look at it as natural law higher than government thats ok with me too but you have to understand that government is not the end of power in our lives
1755255 no but i think we have a restricted government in the sense that we do have a government and jefferson never said separation of church and state
1755256 make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

1755262 if outsourcers take on the carbon footprint of their customers we are presented with an interesting conundrum as a company
1755263 our carbon footprint will always grow as we grow as we take on the it operations of more customers so we add the carbon contribution of those operations to our own however because we run things more efficiently the rise in our footprint should be less than the fall in theirs and overall emissions therefore reduced

1755293 because the zone registers essentially identically in the electrologs from all of the holes over an area about 60 miles in diameter and is everywhere from 30 to 50 feet in thickness the in situ reserves of the material are immense in excess of 100 billion tons
1755294 if it is assumed at this time that the 40 foot anomalous zone detected in the electrologs contains a single seam of coal at least 10 feet in thickness then the possible reserve tonnage of such a seam throughout the 3600 square mile basin would be in the order of 40 billion tons if it is pessimistically assumed that only 10 percent of this coal is recoverable the reserve to a plant would still be about 4 billion tons a very major energy resource
1755295 since the majority of the lower cretaceous coal in the rocky mountains and foothills has some coking characteristics and since it appears that the coaly zone in the drilled basin is of lower cretaceous age there is good reason to expect that some of the coal in that zone may coke
1755296 the geophysical and geological evidence available to date on the possible coal bearing zone lying at a depth of 3 000 feet on the southern albertan saskatchewan border is sufficient to indicate the reasonable chance of the occurrence in the basin of a coalfield whose reserves could reach billions of tons
1755297 in late 1973 mr bell obtained the drill cuttings of hole d7 18 from the interval where it traversed the anomalous zone of possible coal the cuttings consisting of shale coaly shale and hard bright coal were examined by the writer and one vial of them was sent for proximate analysis the purpose of this test was primarily to determine if the coal has coking characteristics even though the sample was not representative and was a mixture of coal and shale
1755298 dry basis analysis made by general testing laboratories in vancouver reported ash 28 43 volatile matter 39 53 fixed carbon 32 04 sulphur 3 05 btu lb 9 790 free swelling index 0
1755299 the sample and its analysis indicate that the anomalous zone contains bituminous coal and coaly shale the electrologs suggest that the zone is mostly coal rather than shale

1755304 insurance marketing executives often find it difficult to feel confident about how to integrate social media into their marketing mix theyre concerned about finding ways to measure and integrate new technologies and interactions and deal with this new world

1755608 your unconventional ways are so inspiring and your beauty is surprisingly non threatening
1755609 like the magical negro the manic pixie dream girl archetype is largely defined by secondary status and lack of an inner life shes on hand to lift a gloomy male protagonist out of the doldrums not to pursue her own happiness
1755610 one of the best lessons my mother ever taught me was not to always rely on designers fashion at its best is when it is mixed up if i had to name a favorite piece it would probably be an all in one sailor striped jumpsuit by marc by marc completely off key
1755611 the clothing company known for ads resembling 1980s porn and for the pervy antics of controversial founder dov charney is seeing sales climb as it buys up more cheap ad space on sites such as myspace and facebook than any other u s apparel retailer

1755619 the verdict a strong effort with several wearable pieces done up in a jewel toned palette with hints of chais signature seaming detail we came home with a striped chiffon skirt a navy rose print blouse a color block dress with a tie waist and a bargain priced 44 99 plaid cotton trench coming on the heels of chais well received fall 08 collection his target range confirms our opinion that the designer is one to keep an eye on
1755620 as we have consistently maintained for over a year omvs irrational business plan for a tie up raises very serious competition issues
1755621 inherently value destructive and would go against economic and strategic rationale
1755622 thats what prime minister ferenc gyurcsany promised to do and hes kept his promise
1755623 the idea is people from this camp will head down to the power station and using various peaceful methods will close it down for the day
1755624 weve been doing our best to go round the villages and talk to people were planning to disrupt the power station not the local people
1755625 its fluctuated but the tide is turning as people are actually realising that we are here to protest peacefully numbers are going up all the time
1755626 weve got a petition going locally and have about 1 500 signatures
1755627 the fact of the matter is a third of british power stations are going to close in the next 10 years we have to provide that capacity and probably a bit more
1755628 kingsnorth is not the main plank of what we plan to do in the future the majority of the replacement is nuclear
1755629 even if one day we can make it work where are you going to put the carbon if you think nuclear waste is a problem co2 has to be kept stored forever and if it escapes bang good bye climate
1755630 our first dinner in hong kong was the cheapest meal we had there and one of only a few cantonese meals during our entire stay there were so many different food options in the city that we ended up eating japanese food italian american fast food oops a cantonese organic fusion meal that was delicious and great for our last dinner in hong kong and of course a couple more cantonese meals one of which dans friend ben treated us to while we were out one night on the town the meal with ben was the first time either of us had eaten beef tendon which was surprisingly good in a spicy noodle curry dish
1755631 it was then off to victoria peak there is a large shopping plaza at the top as well as some restaurants the view of hong kong was awesome it couldve been better if there was no haze but good nonetheless we had some travel bugs to drop off at a geocache here which we did first there were lots of muggles but we managed to pull off the exchange ok we then shopped and ate at the cafe deco which had an excellent international sunday brunch buffet it was pricey at 50 bucks a head but very good after lunch we headed down the pathway towards another geocache we walked down harlech road the main trail around the peak for approx 1 2 hr it was sunday and there were many families out walking their dogs and people just going for a stroll we then headed up another mountain with our shopping bags in tow which the geocache was at the top of we followed a very narrow cement trail with very steep stairs all the way to the top of this mountain only a geocache wouldve taken us there once we were at the top our gps lead us off trail and down the mountain approx 40m as the crow flies through some very dense foliage and steep rocky ground we made it and the view was awesome we headed back to the main peak area and then proceeded to the hollywood road area back in the city this area was like hong kong of old like you would see in the movies seafood fruit and vegetable stalls in the alleyways galore
1755632 we are committed to reduce co2 emissions heavily in the next years so we are doing whatever is possible without destroying the dna of the brand to bring them down to a much better level than today
1755633 but you have to understand it will never meet the 120 g or 130 g per km
1755634 it was my express belief that there would be open free and uncensored access to the internet during the games
1755635 our promise was that journalists would be able to use the internet for their work during the olympic games so we have given them sufficient access to do that
1755636 now we have the chinese government saying it wants to restrict the right to access on issues which it considers are not games related
1755637 my preoccupation now is to ensure there is no impediment to reporting the games themselves
1755638 at the end of the day it is the responsibility of the ioc to ensure proper and fair reporting on the olympic games
1755639 wann hat man als sportler schon einmal die gelegenheit an olympischen spielen teilzunehmen eine verletzung kommt einem nie gelegen aber dass ich gerade jetzt ausfalle ist schon extrem rgerlich
1755640 she said theres a woman on the jury whos quite a bully this womans already decided that hes guilty and that we should go out and see why
1755641 oh yes i heard some of them mentioning that in the jury room
1755642 i conclude from this evidence that there was talk in the jury room about a private visit to watsons bay
1755643 i think that the caller was a member of the jury
1755644 the evidence shows that one or more jurors probably misconducted themselves but as i have explained i am unable to identify any such juror
1755645 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1755646 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1755647 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
1755648 we think theres about 7 million tons of earth soil sitting on mars
1755649 you have to consider the possibility that if we find life on mars it could have come from the earth
1755650 a few reasons an evolutionary origin of life is impossible
1755651 reduced ice thickness in arctic transpolar drift favours rapid ice retreat
1755652 clearly the thinner ice cover favours a stronger areal retreat of the ice during summer
1755653 points to the possibility of further rapid reductions once that vast uniform region has thinned further below certain thresholds
1755654 the arctic sea ice cover has transitioned into a different climatic state where completely ice free summers would soon become normal
1755655 nevertheless it is perhaps too soon to make a definitive pronouncement concerning this years probable extent at the summer minimum
1755656 the arctic sea ice is in a condition we have not seen since satellites began taking measurements thin ice is much more vulnerable to melting completely during the summer it seems likely that we will see a faster than normal rate of decline through the rest of the summer
1755657 real results by the end of my first term in office
1755658 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1755659 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
1755660 with the exception of preventing war this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetime
1755661 one of the good things that came out of the oil shock of the 70s was the dramatic push for energy conservation
1755662 from cars and homes to factories and offices we know how to cost effectively deliver vast quantities of energy savings today
1755663 would be sufficient to cut projected global demand by at least half
1755664 i t is unfair that major industrial polluters dont have to pay the carbon tax while ordinary consumers do
1755665 watch out for false prophets they come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ferocious wolves mat 7 15
1755666 americans always talk in dollars if some of the churchgoers believed that they would not be blessed then they should not have given their money and besides the church goers did not have to give 1 000 if they couldnt afford it then they couldve given less and some of them did does this not make your blood boil ferreira assured rapport that he wasnt attacking hinn and koontz it just20really gets my goat when people make unfounded claims and then theyre off with these peoples money

1755668 the wine estates concept is kind of the new fad

1755670 to me wine is a luxury thats not really a commodity
1755671 our first harvest will be in 2009 and the first wines out of that fruit will be out probably in 2012 i am really excited about what is going to happen in that area in the next five years
1755672 this property is going to grow grapes because this is where people want to grow grapes

1755711 all of us i am sure 10 years ago thought that the need for the man with the rifle would be passing away from the scene in the 1960s
1755712 but the very size and magnitude of these new great weapons have placed a new emphasis upon what we call rather strangely conventional war and they have made it even more mandatory that we keep the man with the rifle
1755713 when you have loved three things all your life from the earliest you can remember to fish to shoot and later to read and when all your life the necessity to write had been your master you learn to remember and when you think back you remember more fishing and shooting and reading than anything else that is a pleasure

1755730 we have world class ports that dump containers into a third world transportation system
1755731 right now were subsidizing our health to send cheap goods to the rest of the nation
1755732 we agree that retailers ought to shoulder their fair share but it is unfair for us to shoulder the full burden of the costs of these initiatives
1755733 we needed to create a fee that would keep us competitive and be fair to customers
1755734 were interested in providing a basis where businesses can flourish
1755735 this is going to be a very large new burden at the very time the economy is struggling and people are having a tough time making ends meet

1755748 offshoring has reduced the availability of good paying jobs for middle class americans it is not only manufacturing jobs that are being moved abroad but software engineering jobs it jobs and a wide range of other professional occupations consequently the ladders of upward mobility are being dismantled many of the professional jobs that remain are being filled with foreigners especially engineers and it professionals from india who are brought in on work visas and paid less by u s employers who falsely claim worker shortages

1755759 its a major milestone for us maybe bittersweet for some
1755760 there are people who picked up and moved their families to california or kansas city thinking the plant was going to close
1755761 i would have liked to stay i wouldnt have taken a buyout if i knew it was staying open until 2011
1755762 ive had a few phone calls from others today saying the same thing
1755763 i think weve proved we make money for ford motor company
1755764 were very very pleased it will stay open until 2011
1755765 hopefully this will give us breathing space to keep it open even longer
1755766 i want to celebrate the fact that weve got at least two more years
1755767 this decision gives us a little breathing room to address the long term viability of the plant
1755768 we must act decisively on a package of incentives that enables ford to produce the kind of fuel efficient vehicles in st paul that will keep the plant thriving now and in the future
1755769 we have been in conversations with ford and we are confident that we can work together toward both short and long term solutions to keep jobs in st paul

1755772 this truck is selling better while other trucks are selling horribly
1755773 what happens beyond 2011 really is dependent on the status of the company then sales figures and the cost competitiveness of the st paul plant
1755774 this is the only plant that builds the ranger at a time when smaller is better
1755775 all this says is based on the current environment they see a need for the plant for several more years
1755776 it doesnt mean it will go away at that point or that it will live forever
1755777 what happens here in st paul is going to be a function of what they put in the redesign of the ranger
1755778 right now personally i would have to give the edge to two sort in terms of the quality of the actual recycled materials

1755784 all their businesses were weaker than i would have expected so it was a disappointing quarter for everyone

1755788 we have a lot to learn from their success too they did some very innovative things to keep people going and their experience rewards system was something that we paid a lot of attention to
1755789 i think its a great game and single player obviously is fantastic they did a hell of a job with their set pieces of scripting certain moments that they were really sure the player was going to actually see and experience first hand the way that they use those moments to craft the player experience halo has a lot to learn from

1755825 wednesday 6th august 2008 sneak preview of first nvidia physx games posted at wednesday 6th august 2008 by clive webster and antony leather a first look at the next generation of gameplay and graphical effects made possible with physics on gpu the future of graphics is physics or so nvidia and ati believe physics promises to make games look more realistic to give you more options when youre playing and to make the objects of a game behave exactly as they should we take a sneak peak at all the physics patches and upcoming games that nvidia will be launching on 19 august nvidia has sent us patches for unreal tournament 3 ghost recon advanced warfighter 2 plus warmonger and metal knight zero weve also got our hands on two new tech demos to show off the power of running the physx physics api on an nvidia geforce graphics card note that only geforce 8 series and later graphics cards are capable of running physx as cuda support is required the benefits of advanced physics modelling in games are twofold you get better visuals with certain types of object and events and you can get more freedom with how you play the game these two benefits are typically referred to as effects physics and gameplay physics and are separated for good reason as they affect games in entirely different ways nvidias physx is capable of doing both types nvidia will be releasing the forceware 177 79 driver physx 8 07 18 driver and a range of patches for games and 3dmark vantage on 12 august visit throughout this feature well take a look at what physics can bring to games before exploring the updates to the games mentioned above click the links at the bottom to find out more
1755826 06 conclusion accurately modelled physics has the potential to improve gaming experiences in a big way while were more likely to see effects physics being added as this doesnt require specific hardware our excitment is reserved for gameplay physics being implemented in more games than just the three nvidia has shown us gameplay physics will change the way we play games and make the playing of these games more realistic and more fun no longer will incorrectly modelled scenery be able to withstand blasts from rockets grenades and tanks rolling over it with physics every object in the game should behave exactly as the real thing would the fly in the ointment is that there are two gaming physics technologies nvidias physx standard and havoks havok fx that looks set to run on both ati hardware and intel owns havok now keeping the two mutually exclusive will do nothing to encourage the adoption of physics effects in games but we suspect this wont be the case for long

1755831 why on earth am i holding on to this what does it represent in my subconscious
1755832 many of us are so full of negativity that were like a one sided magnet repelling any positive changes in our lives
1755833 committing things to paper forces us to look at them clearly
1755834 i almost never think about the stuff i no longer have

1755843 increasingly theyre asking us to go into acquisition and response based media
1755844 i think for agencies in general it can be a little bit tougher to work with the smaller markets
1755845 what you see us developing is really a global suite of performance based offerings
1755846 wouldnt that process be interesting in india or russia where were trying to extend our global reach with search

1755849 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1755850 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1755851 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1755852 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1755853 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1755861 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1755862 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government

1755864 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1755865 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

1755867 but if the results of ken singletons stats in those sims which i posted which showed his b a could vary up to 113 points doesnt that suggest that the statistical expectations of a sim are out of line with what wed expect in reality
1755868 in doing a replay of 1975 would most replayers feel that if steve garvey batted 360 that its an accurate representation of what might have happened garvey never hit higher than 319 i think for luck to have given him 27 extra hits that year is unreasonable i know every one has their own idea of how much variance is credible but garvey would no more likely have hit 360 in 1975 than 278 he was a model of consistency hitting between 281 and 319 every year between 1973 when he took over 1b duties at age 24 and 1985 age 36
1755869 do you think garvey ought to have a 3 in 10 chance of getting a hit in each official at bat during the season adjusted of course properly for pitcher stadium and weather
1755870 do you think it would be ok if garvey wound up hitting 360 in your replay
1755871 on the other during the course of a season in real life players make minor adjustments that in effect accomplish the same thing
1755872 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid

1755893 while greener vehicles are the future lsvs should be used in controlled low speed environments like campuses and retirement communities where the risk of entering into a collision with a faster motor vehicle would be lower than on public roads
1755894 low speed vehicles under the regulation are not designed not meant for mainstream road use
1755895 theres no reason on balance that it should however the devils in the details in the sense that always with caza and with caza institutions animal safety and human safety are paramount
1755896 sea lions are fairly large fast animals and they would need to be very well trained for this kind of a program and as far as i know edmontons are
1755897 lots of facilities have accreditation across this country many of them do not meet the guidelines of caza
1755898 there is a zoo right there in edmonton which has a lone elephant which is against the elephant standards that caza lays out
1755899 the forums will be less formal than traditional debates but still require the candidates to address specific questions from panelists and the audience about pressing business issues

1755901 coders who explore technology through innovation and research play a vital role in developing and securing the software and hardware we use everyday
1755902 yet this important work can be stymied by bogus legal threats
1755903 congress recognized that the anticircumvention provisions could interfere with security research so it included three exceptions to the dmca that permit reverse engineering encryption research and security research under very narrow circumstances
1755904 a researcher must jump additional hurdles to distribute code tools derived from the very limited research activities allowed by the statute
1755905 some young ladies are over in the locker room that they go to school with that are what you call reporters also
1755906 i know espn has millions of people that would love to take my job i am replaceable if the way i prepare and speak with athletes and managers were a problem this would have been an issue before now
1755907 it sounds like you are a great example of somebody who came into the sport of hunting much later than most
1755908 exactly when you find spare time in the offseason as you play sports you meet more people they put you on to it to come try it and if you like it you like it
1755909 ten years ago did you ever imagine yourself being a guy who would hunt deer
1755910 not at all never coming from california dye now 34 was born in vacaville calif i would never envision myself doing this if i had probably been playing for another team in another city that wasnt really known for populations of deer and ducks i probably wouldnt be doing it but you try something and you like it you never know
1755911 you know shane halter then shortstop with the detroit tigers and you guys have a hunting relationship is that right
1755912 yeah in the offseason i kind of got hooked up with him when he used to play for the royals he introduced me to a couple of his hunting friends and they got me hooked he lives here in kansas city in the offseason and we go just about five times a week once the season ends
1755913 was shane responsible for turning you on to the bowhunting side of things
1755914 i like a challenge and i view bowhunting as harder than hunting with a rifle halter kind of got me hooked on it one day we were shooting his bow and arrow and i kind of liked it i went out two years ago and bought one and went out and started hunting
1755915 we hunt on then new york mets pitcher kevin appiers land he still lives here in kansas city
1755916 i think it helps to get away from the sport of baseball and gives you a little quiet time and relax time and just lets you think about being outdoors enjoying the moment it gets your adrenaline going when you see that deer from about 100 yards walking your way
1755917 when i first got my bow and arrow i went out a couple of times and i got my first shot and shot an eight point whitetail so ive got one with my bow and arrow and one nine pointer last offseason with my rifle
1755918 never did it its kind of funny because the guys i go with have been hunting for so long and have maybe killed one deer every time ive gone ive seen a deer and let some go or shot one the first time i shot with my rifle i took a nine pointer after 10 minutes in my stand the guys get on me because they think that it is not fair for me to just start and have two trophy bucks
1755919 so the nine pointer was the first shot ever at a deer
1755920 with my rifle yes and i was in my stand for no more than 10 minutes shane was actually walking down to his stand and couldnt believe it
1755921 what was that experience like some people would say that is amazing you may never get to put a scope on a bigger buck
1755922 exactly i think just from me being able to shoot a shotgun and go duck hunting and stuff i anticipated what it was going to feel like but you still have that feeling of what is going to really be like am i going to be able to keep the rifle steady when i pull the trigger but it came out all right
1755923 yeah ive shot handguns at target ranges but i never felt the power of a rifle from your shoulder
1755924 i like summer sausage and deer jerky but the steaks and the hamburgers i dont really like
1755925 if nobody wants the meat whether it is deer or duck or geese we send it down to the mission and donate it
1755926 what would you say your most memorable day in the field has been and why
1755927 i think my first shot with my bow and arrow it was getting dark and here is this buck trotting over the hill a little bit it was probably my only chance to get a shot off with it getting dark where he was everything played out right the wind was in my face i probably wouldnt have taken the shot if it was earlier because it was a little farther than i wanted but i got him
1755928 yeah but this was the first animal you had taken with a bow what was going through your head
1755929 adrenaline was pumping heart was pumping i just tried to be as calm as i could be and try to pick a spot where i thought he was going to cross over hit the release and calm my nerves i couldnt really tell if i had hit him at first he jumped over this barbed wire fence and ran into some brush i called up kevin and shane and we went looking for him and found him
1755930 i think some athletes i dont know if this is true of everybody compare the adrenaline rush of reeling in a big fish or taking down a whitetail to getting a big hit or making a big play
1755931 i think so anytime you have that adrenaline flowing in hunting and fishing its like the other day in boston we were down by one run in the ninth inning and their closer comes in and i hit a home run to put us in extra innings you get a great feeling from that giving your team a chance to win and we went on to win that game in the 11th inning with another home run
1755932 in the offseason you arent playing baseball youre a competitor though looking for a thrill does hunting fill that gap to some extent
1755933 i think so i cant sit around the house with wife tricia and son jalen doing nothing ive always got to be doing something and the hunting and the fishing takes your mind away from things and puts the competition in your mind you arent stepping in the batters box youre competing with your buddy to catch fish
1755934 thats funny you should mention that is there friendly competition when you get athletes together in the offseason even if it is fishing
1755935 definitely i have a boat and shane has a boat we pack two or three people in there and whoever catches the most fish gets his meal paid for
1755936 so how are you described as a baseball player and does that carry over to hunting or fishing at all
1755937 i think im described as a hard working person who goes out there and plays hard every day and has fun doing it and i think im the same way outdoors i just go out and have fun i dont have to kill anything that day just the joy of being out there and enjoying the atmosphere and being in the wildlife thats fun for me
1755938 he doesnt have any skeletons in his closet hes eaten them all
1755939 so this is a bit like shutting the stable door after the horse has well not so much bolted as seduced your wife stolen the family silver drunk all your cognac smoked your cigars lost interest and ambled off

1755943 there were 60 crewmen eating salami sandwiches its really the least sexy thing you can ever imagine
1755944 we didnt talk about it much then woody told us how the shot was going to be but scarlett and i dont have any funny stories to tell about it it felt like nothing nothing happened
1755945 pimp done told me vell these niggas aint nothing but hoes you make most of your cheese off produ
1755946 you may want to look for the pretty little icon
1755947 congress conspired to grant millions of acres to the railroad barons
1755948 used their political and economic power to take possession of digital channels they have done absolutely nothing to earn
1755949 we competed throughout china in 1988 including playing in the same arena that will host most of the 2008 volleyball competition to me there is a significant difference between the china that i remember and todays china everything is a lot more sophisticated and high tech the bicycle although still great in number is being replaced by the automobile the olympic village in sydney was nice and so were the ones in greece and korea but in my opinion this is the best ever the food is awesome the living and working space are exactly what they need to be and the transportation has been flawless its a little warm but so were the games in atlanta spain and l a the chinese people have been wonderful to work with and extremely friendly im really impressed and im looking forward to the opening ceremony practice the competition and crossing paths with fellow waves

1755952 this is more of a development camp where everybody gets to know everybody in a team oriented feel
1755953 whereas the blackhawks had a lot of young players and a lot of free agent players getting invites to come try out for the team
1755954 some of these kids will be coming back to a regular training camp
1755955 obviously they will be amped up and there will be higher intensity and it will be physical because you are competing for jobs at that point
1755956 this camp is about kids getting their feet wet and becoming part of our organization and hopefully giving them a jumpstart to their pro careers
1755957 the player who shows perseverance toughness and dedication to the merrimack program
1755958 we made a nice leap last year and were moving in the right direction
1755959 bostons a little smaller than chicago but for the most part its a pretty similar city
1755960 all the people have been great and i made a little home out here for myself going to college and everything so its good
1755961 all the offensive linemen are ready to go and theyre going to be ready to go for four quarters
1755962 everybodys got to be alert and everybody has to have their heads ready because they can be called back in at any time
1755963 so its a little different in that aspect but the no 1s are going to have to be ready to go back in if needed but its a great opportunity for some young guys to play a lot
1755964 hes working hard and were going to try to get him up to speed as much as possible and well see where hes at when we kick it off
1755965 he looks good in practice but i think when the lights click on some people have that ability to show up and shine and i think hes one of those guys
1755966 hes working hard he a guy who doesnt say much but hes intense and he wants to win
1755967 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot

1755970 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1755975 im experienced at buying malls that are value added meaning that its been in trouble what i basically do is revitalize them by giving more incentives to tenants and doing whatever is possible to bring more traffic to the mall
1755976 id like to send a message to everyone that is willing to come in as a merchant that i will work with them and do everything possible in my power to get their businesses going including those that are already in the mall

1755990 five years ago there were lots and lots of people whod never heard of a churro and many of the people who did know what one was had had one at disneyland or at a ballpark
1755991 ill tip my hat to them they familiarized the american people with churros and gave people that first wonderful experience
1755992 theyre sold in the mornings by women who carry large flat baskets on their heads
1755993 these churros are made at home and brought into the market to sell still hot and covered with granulated sugar
1755994 the menu is churros and four kinds of hot chocolate and thats it

1756000 they mean a lot to people it gets them thinking about being with their families and we get a lot of emotional reactions weve had people who come in and cry

1756022 an increasing likelihood that oil and gas prices will be stronger for longer
1756023 events are playing out even faster than any of us expected
1756024 the future gas prices nhtsa used to estimate the impact of higher fuel economy were so unrealistically low as to be laughable the energy information administration projects that in 2015 the price of gas will be a mere 2
1756025 why is that important in nhtsas model consumers are much less likely to buy more fuel efficient cars if gas is that cheap rather than the 4 00 per gallon were paying right now operating under the assumption that gas prices will be that low in 2015 the dept of transportation only requires automakers to install as much fuel saving technology as they think consumers will pay extra for
1756026 the department of transportation to use realistic and rational gas price assumptions as it calculates the maximum feasible fuel economy standards for the coming years as required by the energy bill passed by congress last year
1756027 u sing realistic gas price assumptions will ensure that fuel economy standards will reduce gas prices and our dangerous dependence on foreign oil as much as possible
1756028 for every 10 percent in weight reduction theres an 8 percent increase in fuel economy
1756029 we were absolutely thrilled with the number of people who gave testimony to nhtsa
1756030 i think they made it obvious that the american people are truly concerned about fuel economy and its role as one of the few real solutions to our energy crisis
1756031 the most disappointing thing about nhtsas draft environmental impact statement is that it fails to analyze the benefits of greenhouse gas emission reductions from various fuel economy standards in the proper context not surprisingly when nhtsa tries to determine the global warming impacts in 2100 resulting from a 31 6 mpg in 2015 standard vs a 35 mpg in 2015 standard statistically there is very little but this does mean that raising fuel economy standards faster will not have a significant impact in our struggle to reduce global warming pollution
1756032 in the short term this means we need to reduce our emissions by between 25 and 40 by 2020
1756033 nhtsa has proposed standards for both cars and light trucks in response to the eisas mandate to achieve a fleet wide fuel economy average of

1756038 in view of our special relations with china the president has decided to attend the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics

1756040 as having special significance in public school and educational institutions and encourages those entities to conduct suitable commemorative exercises on that date
1756041 based on his disregard and disrespect for human life we should question his insistence that hes a christian it is inconsistent with the biblical world view to think that not only is abortion okay but he goes so far as to support partial birth abortion
1756042 theres a problem in this hardcore left philosophy of barack obama that people keep dismissing
1756043 i think obamas social policies will destroy whats left of the black family socialism doesnt work it doesnt work for individuals it doesnt work for families and it doesnt work for our society our society cannot coexist with socialism
1756044 i would never support someone just because of their race and i certainly wouldnt support a hardcore leftwing liberal marxist as barack obama is
1756045 you cannot put the principles that we say we hold dear on the sidelines because race is now a factor
1756046 its the principles of america that have made america great not the ethnicity of the people that develop those principles and put them into law and establish this great nation
1756047 young people who grow up with the freedom to trade goods will ultimately demand the freedom to trade ideas especially on an unrestricted internet
1756048 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions

1756050 the peoples republic of china is an authoritarian state in which as specified in its constitution the chinese communist party ccp is the paramount source of power

1756052 human rights record remained poor and controls were tightened in some areas
1756053 citizens did not have the right to change their government
1756054 government tightened restrictions on freedom of speech and the press
1756055 included extrajudicial killings torture and coerced confessions of prisoners and the use of forced labor including prison labor the government continued to monitor harass detain arrest and imprison journalists writers activists and defense lawyers and their families many of whom were seeking to exercise their rights under law the party and state exercised strict political control of courts and judges conducted closed trials and carried out administrative detention
1756056 individuals and groups especially those deemed politically sensitive by the government of china continued to face tight restrictions on their freedom to assemble their freedom to practice religion and their freedom to travel the government continued its coercive birth limitation policy in some cases resulting in forced abortion and sterilization
1756057 its a little bit unusual for us to release it as prepared for delivery but given the time difference and the flights for both this flight and then for your colleagues that are on the charter i think this was the best way for you to be able to have some time to digest it
1756058 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1756059 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs

1756073 so i will be patient i will be consistent and i will do my best
1756074 and theres no place on earth that more clearly demonstrates the contrast between free and open societies and repressive closed societies than the korean peninsula
1756075 no better place to see an example between the beauty of freedom and the hope of freedom and the difficulties with repressive and closed societies and south korea takes its rightful place on the world stage north korea traps its people in misery and isolation

1756185 volumes peaked on 27 march with 185 billion spam messages being sent in just one day

1756187 by 2015 a globally networked intelligence enterprise will be essential to meet the demands for greater forethought and improved strategic agility the existing agency centric intelligence community must evolve into a true intelligence enterprise established on a collaborative foundation of shared services mission centric operations and integrated mission management all enabled by a smooth flow of people ideas and activities across the boundaries of the intelligence community agency members
1756188 old problems assume new dimensions information operations with emphasis on a cyber domain asymmetric political or military responses and illicit trafficking lastly we confront the challenge of acting in an environment that is more time sensitive and open to the flow of information in which intelligence sources and analysis compete in a public context established by a global media by 2015 we will need integrated and collaborative capabilities that can anticipate and rapidly respond to a wide array of threats and risks
1756189 our analytic professionals will collaborate with world class experts in academe commercial interests and think tanks all with similar knowledge and personal networks deep expertise will require broad access to open source information our unique collection results and a network of outside experts our understanding of the breadth and depth of policy intelligence doctrine and global situational awareness must match the depth of our analyses
1756190 by 2015 the intelligence community will be expected to provide more details about more issues to more customers

1756215 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1756216 this is good news in addition to president bushs statement on religious freedom that he is expected to give following a beijing church service the president is now going to call attention to chinas human rights deficit shortly before he arrives for the olympic games and bush well knows that the first liberty is religious liberty without which all freedoms are meaningless his comments on this subject come on the heels of a plea by pope benedict xvi to chinese leaders to open china to the gospel

1756328 disney and apple microsoft are in the same business short circuiting laborious explicit verbal communication with expensively designed interfaces disney is a sort of user interface unto itself and more than just graphical lets call it a sensorial interface it can be applied to anything in the world real or imagined albeit at staggering expense why are we rejecting explicit word based interfaces and embracing graphical or sensorial ones a trend that accounts for the success of both microsoft and disney part of it is simply that the world is very complicated now much more complicated than the hunter gatherer world that our brains evolved to cope with and we simply cant handle all of the details we have to delegate we have no choice but to trust some nameless artist at disney or programmer at apple or microsoft to make a few choices for us close off some options and give us a conveniently packaged executive summary but more importantly it comes out of the fact that during this century intellectualism failed and everyone knows it in places like russia and germany the common people agreed to loosen their grip on traditional folkways mores and religion and let the intellectuals run with the ball and they screwed everything up and turned the century into an abbatoir those wordy intellectuals used to be merely tedious now they seem kind of dangerous as well we americans are the only ones who didnt get creamed at some point during all of this we are free and prosperous because we have inherited political and values systems fabricated by a particular set of eighteenth century intellectuals who happened to get it right but we have lost touch with those intellectuals and with anything like intellectualism even to the point of not reading books any more though we are literate we seem much more comfortable with propagating those values to future generations nonverbally through a process of being steeped in media apparently this actually works to some degree for police in many lands are now complaining that local arrestees are insisting on having their miranda rights read to them just like perps in american tv cop shows when its explained to them that they are in a different country where those rights do not exist they become outraged starsky and hutch reruns dubbed into diverse languages may turn out in the long run to be a greater force for human rights than the declaration of independence a huge rich nuclear tipped culture that propagates its core values through media steepage seems like a bad idea there is an obvious risk of running astray here words are the only immutable medium we have which is why they are the vehicle of choice for extremely important concepts like the ten commandments the koran and the bill of rights unless the messages conveyed by our media are somehow pegged to a fixed written set of precepts they can wander all over the place and possibly dump loads of crap into peoples minds
1756329 our ancestors couldnt have foreseen however the sheer quantity of visual distractions which while they aid also hinder our readerly minds eye indeed surveys carried out in schools confirm that non illustrated texts produce more mental images than illustrated ones while theres a text image balance to be struck as a means to training youthful brains in the art of visualising we know that as adults the extent to which book covers and even author photographs while helping us situate a text before we crack open the pages quite often mislead im not quite arguing that in order to focus our minds we go back to minimalist editions de minuit style book covers as practiced over here in france by their very austerity they convey to the reader the immediate impression of the publishing houses chilly prestige i am intrigued rather by the practice of certain readers like nabokov who produced for his cornell students mock serious diagrams of the comparative states of mind of doctor jekyll and mr hyde or drew up sketches of beetle man gregor samsa in kafkas metamorphosis

1756393 we zijn allebei heel nuchter maar ook gevoelsmensen en we vinden familie allebei heel belangrijk jan en ik zijn beiden heel open bijna altijd vrolijk en ook heel impulsief
1756394 veel mensen vinden ons een rare combinatie yolanthe wordt gezien als die bitch en ik ben die leuke aardige jongen
1756395 door die vooroordelen heb ik even getwijfeld was het wel slim als jan en ik iets met elkaar krijgen ik dacht dat zijn fans mij misschien niet leuk zouden vinden
1756396 ik zei tegen haar als jij bij mij een knopje kunt vinden dat mijn gevoel uitschakelt dan hebben we het probleem opgelost maar ik ben verliefd hier ben ik ik ga niet meer weg
1756397 dat zei hij echt toen dacht ik het is eigenlijk ook te gek voor woorden twee mensen vinden elkaar leuk maar beginnen niets met elkaar vanwege de mening van anderen

1756404 this underscores why america cannot afford another president who sides with big oil instead of consumers
1756405 barack obama has a plan that takes on big oil and would provide us with 1 000 in real relief to get us through todays crisis while putting us squarely on the road to energy independence meanwhile john mccains taken over 2 000 000 in campaign cash from big oil and now wants them to have another 4 000 000 000 in government giveaways we literally cannot afford another president who sides with big oil instead of american consumers
1756406 this would not only permanently bust the budget with its 1 7 trillion price tag but it would tremendously benefit big oil

1756418 we had a new patch put in place in the affected areas by midday last friday but we now have a re emergence of a similar problem in the brisbane area
1756419 were not sure how long it will take to fix this problem again but we hope soon
1756420 nokias latest version of the software was in effect contaminated we had a bug in the software so we have had to roll it back
1756421 the issue for us is that we have put the upgrade in other areas and have had no problems whatsoever so its a bit of a lottery
1756422 there was extensive testing on both our parts and we were also assured by nokia siemens that the software would work in different network environments
1756423 but when we went live it was a different story
1756424 now were just hoping the patch will hold we cant say for sure whether or not we will have more issues over the next week in brisbane

1756426 we have told nokia to fly out some engineers because we certainly wont be flying them here
1756427 we do have some service level guarantees with them and we will clearly be looking at whether in fact the software they have given us is up to scratch
1756428 we are not looking to sue them on this what we are doing is looking to work with them to fix it
1756429 we bought it from kenya after normal supplies dwindled due to delays we saw an opportunity and took it

1756450 the significance of this is that it brings robotics to a younger age
1756451 at that age the children dont know theyre learning math and science they just know that theyre playing
1756452 its essentially programming but its so visual that the kids dont realize theyre doing some basic programming
1756453 when youre dealing with that age group you need to be very clear about your focus and what you want to accomplish
1756454 we lose some children along the way especially the girls
1756455 but we know we will need them to understand science and math later on
1756456 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye

1756460 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
1756461 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye

1756485 theyre very sexy theyre hilarious and theres a lot of very interesting sociology its the kind of book you think im going to read one chapter before i go to bed and you read six
1756486 its another amazing cast who are just doing really spectacular work
1756487 theres a lot of dark humor it certainly goes places that ive never seen a series go before its not as existentially exhausting as six feet under was maybe but ultimately its similar terrain in that its really just exploring the human condition and the vampire condition since theyre not really humans anymore
1756488 theres a lot of gray area the vampires are just like humans

1756622 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1756623 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1756624 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1756625 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease

1756655 for the first time since this general election campaign began in early june republican john mccain attracted virtually as much media attention as his democratic rival last week
1756656 advertising was the second biggest campaign story line last week filling 10 of the campaign newshole and the ripple effects were felt throughout the week the ad generated another narrative whether mccain campaign was too negative that filled 6 of the newshole the tone of the campaign and the new mccain ad then triggered a third major story line when obama accused republicans of trying to frighten americans because he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills the mccain team responded by accusing obama of playing the race card and that controversy at 15 became the biggest campaign narrative of all

1756701 retiree fees ought to relate to how much the plan is worth
1756702 the higher value plans should have higher premiums associated with them
1756703 they ought to reflect how much income an individual has so that if they make more money and are therefore better able to pay for a system they should do so
1756704 when tricare started out in 1995 military members retirees were charged 230 per individual 460 per family
1756705 today in 2008 theyre charged 230 per individual 460 per family
1756706 essentially what this says to you is that we are asking our older retirees who are in fact the least likely to hold jobs and therefore have the lowest incomes to pay the most for their system
1756707 we believe we need to get some parity between our older and our younger retirees
1756708 we believe that the under 65 retirees should begin paying 40 percent of the medicare part b premium using the same fee structure that is laid on by the medicare system
1756709 in addition we believe that the under 65 retirees who elect to use tricare standard and extra need to pay a small fee for that
1756710 and we would suggest to the department that that fee be set at 15 percent of the medicare part b we think the family rate should be set at double the individual rate and that the premium increase needs to be phased in over four years

1756726 god from all eternity did by the most wise and holy counsel of his own will freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass
1756727 in him we were predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will
1756728 our god is in heaven he does whatever pleases him
1756729 the lord does whatever pleases him in the heavens and on the earth in the seas and all their depths
1756730 let all the earth fear the lord let all the peoples of the world revere him for he spoke and it came to be he commanded and it stood firm the lord foils the plans of the nations he thwarts the purposes of the peoples but the plans of the lord stand firm forever the purposes of his heart through all generations

1756737 the church did not mis speak this prayer they acknowledged that what herod and pilate and the jews had done to jesus christ in the crucifixion was exactly what gods power and will had decided beforehand should happen but was not pilate guilty in condemning jesus of course was herod free of condemnation no were the jewish leaders acting with pure motivations or were their hearts filled with hatred toward the christ the answer is obvious yet in this obviously evil action of condemning and murdering the sinless pure lamb of god we see gods hand it did not merely take place with his permission but at his bidding the motivations of those involved were evil theres no doubt about it yet can we think of any greater example where gods motivations were any higher any purer can we think of any single event that will bring about more good and result in more glory to god than the death of christ as the perfect substitute for sinners surely not
1756738 there has not been a single prosecution of a woman for making a false claim

1756761 to focus on issues of software freedom in network services
1756762 i reached out to a number of people to discuss the issue
1756763 but obviously we all have external relationships and some of us certainly hope that in the long run our organizations adopt some or all of thinking
1756764 it is also important to note that we dont all agree on everything im probably more business friendly than some members for example some other members think that if we dont replace all centralized web applications with p2p based applications were doomed
1756765 the current trend towards hosted software brings a lot of benefits but it also restricts the autonomy of users since they often cant control the data hardware or software of the services they use given that the trend doesnt seem to be going away any time soon if anything it seems to be picking up steam it seems important to get together and think about the issue
1756766 speaking from my own work for ngos there is an increasing concern that for profit software as a service providers are not aligned with the values of mission based organizations
1756767 civicactions has already been responding to the need for independence from our no profit clients including amnesty international the american civil liberties union witness fsf creative commons and numerous others as these organizations grow into a social web they have a need for developers who are aligned with their values and they need services that will not break the social contract with their members
1756768 more of a salon than anything else a place where people meet to share ideas so we might have people drop in on the salon blog who never formally affiliate and were always looking for people who share similar interests it might better to think of us less as a political party with clearly defined membership ideology and more like a very informal think tank where serious thinkers and conscientious doers are always welcome to drop in and chat
1756769 id expect that from time to time we may issue statements that publicize and refine our thinking
1756770 but we may also leave that up to other organizations
1756771 members of our group value their independence but have a commitment to freedom and openness
1756772 i would imagine that some end user groups will form to take on a more activist role in this area it is unlikely that the tactics of these groups will be coordinated centrally but our commitment to our communities will ultimately move the power to the edge of the network giving individuals the ability to move quickly to respond to threats and embrace opportunities
1756773 i think our goals are primarily education and stimulation at this point if nothing else we want to prod people to think about these issues instead of letting them fall by the wayside as they have at times
1756774 you dont have to be a software engineer to get involved and you dont have to program
1756775 everyone is welcome to participate were particularly interested in engaging with designers who have not typically been involved with open source projects and were biasing towards broad participation not finished implementations

1756895 i just want to take part in something bigger than myself and this is supposed to represent the best humanity has to offer
1756896 i volunteered because i love sports and i want to be a sports reporter someday so this was the perfect way to get my start
1756897 i am really looking forward to interviewing the athletes hopefully serena or venus and learning about the fast paced life of a sports journalist i hope to gain some valuable experience and some contacts to use in the future
1756898 i grew up watching the olympics and i always knew id attend at least one olympic event live when the chance to be a link in the olympic chain arose i knew id be crazy not to pursue it so many people dream about either competing in the games or attending them live well im not an athlete but i have the rare opportunity to be part of the production
1756899 im looking forward to seeing the changes before during and after the games as china has been relentlessly constructing and deconstructing itself in preparation for the games
1756900 i decided to become a part of this project because of the rare opportunities it provided to be a part of this huge event and the huge media operation behind it to come to china and experience the culture here and to bring together my journalism and international studies majors in practice
1756901 im hoping to gain some practical experience in how the media operates particularly in the context of the olympics i also want to leave with a little more knowledge of this complex country one that few outsiders seem to truly understand but that is growing significantly in importance on the international scene
1756902 i volunteered for the iowa olympic ambassadors project because i felt that this once in a lifetime opportunity would help me grow both personally and professionally as i encounter diverse individuals and learn about other cultures
1756903 i hope to gain a better understanding of chinese culture and am looking forward to witnessing the significant impact an international event such as the olympics has on a community
1756904 i volunteered to experience foreign cultures and see the olympics first hand
1756905 i hope to interact with as many fascinating people as possible and soak up the diverse atmosphere while improving my knowledge of the chinese language and culture
1756906 i volunteered for the iowa olympic ambassador project because i saw it as a chance of a lifetime
1756907 it was a chance that wasnt going to come by very often to get the chance to be a part of the olympics as well as spend this much time in beijing is a life changing experience and one that i couldnt pass up it involves the two things that i major in sports and journalism and want to have a career in so it seemed like the perfect fit i look to gain an overall better knowledge of journalism first and foremost being surrounded by all of the different media outlets from around the world will undoubtedly show me what the world of journalism will hold for me
1756908 i found this as a perfect opportunity to commit myself to learning the chinese language and to play a role not only in the summer olympics but in the most anticipated perhaps ever also i always enjoy representing my family alma maters hometown and home state especially in this case where we are considered ambassadors by each chinese person we meet
1756909 this experience will look great on a resume im sure any future employer would love to know what kind of work i did at the olympic games
1756910 also im looking to interact with various journalists or media outlets make connections and hopefully re connect with them in the future possibly for a job opportunity
1756911 i volunteered for this because i might want to be a sports reporter and working at the olympics is a once in a lifetime opportunity
1756912 i want to learn about chinese culture and experience the olympics both as a fan and a volunteer
1756913 the beijing 2008 olympics promised to be one of significance in the history of the world the promise of political controversy addressing of environmental concerns human rights concerns and more has put china under a microscope from the moment it received the bid for the games
1756914 for an international studies major this experience has provided a well rounded education on all of these i believed that to be present at the games and to watch history in the making would be an invaluable indescribable experience so far it has proven to be
1756915 when i found out about the iowa olympic ambassadors project i decided it was the perfect opportunity to experience china learn the language and put my fresh journalism expertise to work at the worlds most prestigious sporting event
1756916 i hope ill come home with the skills to handle the toughest challenges my future jobs throw at me being in the heat of the olympic action will show me what it takes to handle real world news reporting and production working among chinese volunteers who operate with a collective mentality has already sharpened the management and teamwork skills i will need for future work in tv production finally im looking forward to seeing how the olympics affect chinas future
1756917 i volunteered to get the journalism practice and experience i wanted to meet people from all over the world and to be a part of a major international event
1756918 i volunteered because i thought it would be a great opportunity experience a new culture as well as to work at the olympics
1756919 i really hope to gain a better understanding of journalism in a professional setting as well as to gain a better perspective on chinese society

1756962 there were plenty of times it was a crazy scene arum said
1756963 it was the center for getting all the best talent thats what the olympics used to be
1756964 the days of going out there those are gone said dan goossen the veteran promoter and manager who has signed david reid and andre ward the last two americans to win boxing gold medals
1756965 the key is knowing which guys you want even before the olympics arum said
1756966 that used to be where you sign them but you already had to have an idea
1756967 the scoring has become so arcane in the amateurs that for a fighter to excel he has to have skills that dont necessarily translate into becoming a good pro arum said
1756968 the idea that punches count the same no matter the force and then only punches that land on a certain part of the glove count it turns guys really into different kinds of fighters from those that fight professionally
1756969 andre had a tremendous amateur style rather than a professional style and its one of the reasons its taken him a bit longer to develop in the professional ranks goossen said
1756970 after three years he has learned the professional style in the gym the speed and quickness that he used so well in the amateurs have been an asset in the pros but he also had to learn how to combine it with pro skills
1756971 its about the dollar and just being an olympian alone coming out im not guaranteed to make a certain amount of money said bantamweight
1756972 its not just being an olympian that will make you a lot of money
1756973 i never even let that into my head said andrade the top ranked amateur in his division for three years
1756974 i want that gold medal more than anything if i dont get a pro career it would probably be worth it if i had a gold medal
1756975 i suppose if you can win a gold medal if you can medal going through all the nonsense of the olympics has a great value arum said

1757033 by far the largest suppliers of precursors for chemical weapons production were in singapore 4 515 tons the netherlands 4 261 tons egypt 2 400 tons india 2 343 tons and west germany 1 027 tons
1757034 typical liberal perspective assuming the us needed authority from anyone to invade iraq
1757035 israeli warplanes bombed a reactor project at the site in 1981 later u n inspectors documented and safeguarded the yellowcake which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 gulf war there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 the official said
1757036 the irony is that the tuwaitha facility south of baghdad already possessed yellow cake uranium
1757037 designed to ensure the materials arent diverted for weapons use or end up in the wrong hands
1757038 while yellowcake alone is not considered potent enough for a so called

1757051 de qu sirve una multitud si en cada persona silba la soledad
1757052 cantas y cantas y hablas y hablas y ruedas por el tiempo y lloras como lirio desatado y suspiras entre largos agonizantes que no saben qu decir
1757053 la muerte tiene tan asegurada su victoria que deja toda una vida de ventaja
1757054 soy mi cuerpo y mi cuerpo est triste est cansado me dispongo a dormir una semana un mes no me hablen
1757055 cuando yo te digo te amo es cierto que te amo pero no es verdad que yo te lo digo
1757056 no me queda nada s lo nombres viejos nuevos nombres amados

1757072 cuanta menos carga de antojos se saque de esta vida m s andadero se encuentra el camino de la otra

1757143 most companies would call themselves innovative and would claim theyre delivering an above average service to their customers yet their customers opinions might differ if you drill a company on their innovation practices they would probably mention two approaches they employ 1 their research department meets with target groups compiles presentations for the upper management which then occasionally hands those reports over to the development department 2 their research or marketing department comes up with competitive matrix of the products available from competition in a meeting then executives see that their product is missing a feature and hence the development department is assigned the task of adding an internet enabled installer to the product since everybody else offers them thereby creating market expectations

1757392 this one here is a spider plant and this is a mint
1757393 elitist is another word for arrogant which is another word for uppity that old calumny applied to blacks who stood up for themselves
1757394 casting obama as out of touch plays harmoniously with the traditional notion of blacks as others at the edge of the mainstream separate from the whole
1757395 any discussion of obamas skinniness and its impact on the typical american voter
1757396 cant avoid being interpreted as a coded discussion of race
1757397 barack obama is the first african american to win a major party nomination for president of the united states african americans are distinguishable from other americans by their skin color this physical attribute looms large in our nations history as a source of prejudice
1757398 when white people are invited to think about obamas physical appearance the principal attribute theyre likely to dwell on is his dark skin consequently any reference to obamas other physical attributes cant help coming off as a coy walk around the barn
1757399 notion of that controller is a non trivial point that youve brought up that control and that familiarity is like comfort food from my perspective we lead we dont follow
1757400 as a brand nintendos got their thing and were not trying to get the senior citizen group to get into gaming were looking to convert the ps2 owners and the tens of millions of installed base that were playing dvds and playing games on their ps2 to now play blu ray movies and blu ray games with their ps3
1757401 quite surprised we looked at each other what should we do now
1757402 we decided to proceed to state senator pippys office two blocks down the street
1757403 as we left senator pippys office three 60 year old ladies and 45ish f
1757404 his reply once more was they did not have to let me in i said i thought he was giving more service to them than to me he replied if i felt threatened he would do the same to protect me as he was doing for them i asked if he felt i was a threat to anyone he smiled but did not answer
1757405 remember i did not give my name or any id this morning rep murphy himself called my home to see what happened i wonder where he got my name i will be going to the mt lebanon police station to review the report
1757406 i think murphys office owes us all an explanation democrat steve odonnell is running for that seat so if you live in preserving culture amp community as well as we do history
1757407 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
1757408 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
1757409 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
1757410 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
1757411 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
1757412 theirs was a new york love a checkered taxi ride burning rubber and like the city their passion was open 24 7 steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm moist white breath through manhole covers stamped forged by delaney bros

1757416 the latest u n proposal issued after meetings with kurdish president massoud barzani was a plot aimed at strengthening the kurds further in kirkuk
1757417 i guess the best way to put it is if theres an announcement id be as surprised as anybody else
1757418 i dont think its the kind of thing you say no to andrea the answer to that is yes i love my day job im not looking to change but if someone who will be leading the country comes to you and says i need your help i want you to do this of course if you care about serving your country that is the kind of thing that you do
1757419 some of you may have seen mccains new ad featuring britney spears and paris hilton this is immature rediculous and undermines the role of president for which they both are applying how many of you think this kind of stuff has a place in our politics well it seems that after many negative reviews of his ad mccain decided to say it was just humor and they thought it was funny well unlike john mccain obama takes his campaign very seriously and i dont think the american people like to be disrespected like that we dont think that our energy crisis is funny we dont think that living paycheck to paycheck is funny we dont think that loosing our home is funny we dont think that not having healthcare for our kids is funny we dont think that iraq war where thousands of americans have died and billions of our dollars have been spent is funny its time to stop being silly and get serious about real change for america
1757420 obama says rural people need to drive small cars and take non existent public transportation

1757641 con un colpo di mano notturno e senza alcuna possibilit di discussione la maggioranza ha cancellato di fatto e in un solo colpo 800 mila assegni sociali
1757642 gli emendamenti allarticolo 20 del decreto legge sulla manovra economica votati dalla maggioranza azzerano nella pratica la platea di quanti casalinghe lavoratori a nero disoccupati religiosi missionari emigrati che rientrano in italia avendo superato i 65 anni det e non percependo alcun reddito avevano fino ad oggi beneficiato di un minimo sostegno assistenziale come tra laltro sancito dallarticolo 38 della costituzione
1757643 la cisl contraria alla norma contenuta nella legge finanziaria che vincola il diritto allassegno sociale ad un periodo continuativo di lavoro di 10 anni
1757644 lintroduzione di tale requisito di fatto determinerebbe la conseguenza paradossale che proprio le fasce pi deboli della popolazione potrebbero non beneficiare di questa provvidenza ma soprattutto lintroduzione di tale requisito va a snaturare la prestazione che si trasformerebbe da assistenziale in previdenziale modificando lobiettivo stesso dellassegno

1757653 un emendamento al comma 10 dellat 20 che stabiliva i requisiti richiesti ai cittadini stranieri ultra sessantacinquenni per avere diritto allassegno sociale fissati in cinque anni di soggiorno legale e continuativo
1757654 prevede oltre al soggiorno legale anche un lavoro legale continuativo con un reddito non inferiore allassegno sociale stesso e ancora pi grave passa dai 5 ai 10 anni il periodo minimo
1757655 in concreto osserva il sindacalista significa negare lassegno sociale a tutti gli immigrati e prevederlo in teoria soltanto per quelli che non ne hanno bisogno perch avranno avuto un lavoro ed un reddito che gli dar diritto alla pensione contributiva
1757656 snatura il senso profondo dellistituto dellassegno sociale come strumento di aiuto ai soggetti pi deboli ed accentua in modo intollerabile le discriminazioni normative nei confronti degli immigrati

1757700 when the general webmaster seo community started to learn about 301 redirects some went quite wild throwing 301s around like confetti and then getting smacked down hard
1757701 penalties for significant 301 abuse across several domains can be quite severe including long time or even
1757702 interesting i hadnt realised the impact of the redirects insofar as penalties were concerned until the recent comments i should have been attentive to it because we saw sites behaving differently in various circumstances e g site a under penalty filter is redirected to site b site b goes into a penalty situation non trust appears to have been transferred site c trusted redirects to a new domain ranking inside 4 weeks trust transferred site a under penalty filter redirects to new site e site e goes into sandbox for 1 year non trust transferred to new domain site d has had frequent redirects applied to it say every 9 12 months the site has never come out of a penalty filter situation since 2005 also some comments with regards to redirects 404s and potential problems over url http www webmasterworld com google 3694988 htm here url is it better to apply 404s to old pages and create new ones on other domains when redirects have already been applied
1757703 google is well aware of various types of abuse and has slapped several well known people for such abuse in recent months im not mentioning those tricks here except for the one that matt cutts blogged about that was all to do with buying a domain name and existng site and then redirecting it to another site purely to try to enhance the pagerank of the site being redirected to
1757704 internal redirects are less touchy but still you can make a mess with chains of redirects when completely changing the url structure of a site to be avoided as much as possible by the way i still prefer only to redirect key url and let google sort out the 404s and the new site structure essentially through normal spidering
1757705 this is interesting youre damned if you do and damned if you dont i have been recently trying to rememdy duplicate title descriptions reported in wmt by blocking some of the urls in robot txt i wont go into the technicalities but the crux of the issue is that my dynamic site produces two sets of urls pointing to the same page when people hop over to the online store i figured the actual stores url was more important so i nixed the dupe urls that seemed to serve no purpose apparently those transitional urls were worth something as blocking them has led to a fairly steep drop in traffic now i have had to go back and pull the blocked urls from robots txt the only other way to remedy this that i can see is to use a 301 redirect on all the store urls oy vey the first set of urls will never be removed though they will stay in place is internal redirecting like that that risky
1757706 even when youre passing the query string it should only be a single redirect in apache im not sure how iis isapi rewrite handles these cases but i dont believe its very different

1758001 what they discovered 3000 years ago in iran is that you can dig a tunnel between the level of the groundwater to a point which is lower than the place where you will actually extract the water so for example you have a mountain which has groundwater inside but that water is located at a level which is higher than the small village in the next door valley which is where they want to use that water the tunnel then runs downhill as it were following the slope of the mountain and the groundwater that filters into the tunnel up in the mountain travels down and ends up in a reservoir in the village without any effort being involved
1758002 in the modern era the need for water has increased because of things like large scale farming you can see what happens then for example in iran people dig wells and pump the water up with diesel motors as a result the groundwater level drops and the first things to feel the impact of that are the traditional qanats

1758251 its the first time where we actually meet all of us most of us have been here for two three four five days but its the first time that we gathered were here for the flag raising so it was very special and you could feel that the whole team is happy to be here the village is incredible so were ready to compete now
1758252 i won exactly on the sixth of august 1984 so to see the canadian flag go up like this and now in the position of chef de mission it was very special for me
1758253 for us it is pretty much the last thing we will do as the olympic team until august 17th so it was important for us to be here
1758254 we had to rush through the workout but it was important for us to be here and the kids really wanted to be here good mood great village we had a great camp so people are excited
1758255 one coach had a good analogy he said you know what

1758287 patients may not be learning this information from their health care providers and information regarding colon cancer prevention is not as well publicized as it could be
1758288 in the context of busy clinic visits it is in some ways efficient for patients to be reminded that physical activity is good for their health in general going through each specific health benefit of physical activity would take considerable time
1758289 sedentary people should first set such moderate achievable goals more benefits could accrue from higher levels and more intense exercise such as jogging running or tennis to some extent more may be better but it is important to note that a little is much better than nothing

1758292 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

1758294 theres a search to find a deeper meaning in design something based on the philosophy that design is there to create a positive impact on life ive altered my focus of design to one that comes as a result of observing scenarios environments behaviours and people integrating and blending them in perfect harmony with aesthetics that remove the element of candy coating and gimmickry providing the user with design in its pure nature pure in a way that serves its function and serves it well void of elements unrelated to the task

1758296 winning game 1 is very important because you give the other team the burden of adjusting
1758297 what happened was we started very well because we were so fired up
1758298 i think after a while the boys figured out that they are in the finals and it has a very different atmosphere
1758299 but i think we will be a much better team in the second game
1758300 i think its the courts which are qualified to make that declaration if thats their belief then they can go to court but in the meantime we are running the slaughterhouse
1758301 its just one of those things an occupational hazard as long as all of our actions are not in violation of any existing law or regulation well continue to do our duty because we have to protect the interest of the city
1758302 not aware of any law that gives them that authorization
1758303 they cannot go directly to the department heads all their actuations must be coursed to the mayor and the mayor will endorse this request to the department concerned we have to make a delineation between the council and their office their primary purpose is to enact laws

1758307 your oxen were plowing with the donkeys feeding beside them when the sabeans raided us they stole all the animals and killed all the farmhands i am the only one who escaped to tell you
1758308 the fire of god has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the shepherds i am the only one who escaped to tell you
1758309 three bands of chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants i am the only one who escaped to tell you
1758310 your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brothers home suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the desert and hit the house on all sides the house collapsed and all your children are dead i am the only one who escaped to tell you
1758311 i came naked from my mothers womb and i will be stripped of everything when i die the lord gave me everything i had and the lord has taken it away
1758312 you just let me take away the things he holds dear and then see how loyal and faithful job will be hell curse you to your face
1758313 the lord gave me everything i had and the lord has taken it away praise the name of the lord
1758314 have you noticed my servant job he is the finest man in all the earth a man of complete integrity he fears god and will have nothing to do with evil and he has maintained his integrity even though you persuaded me to harm him without cause
1758315 skin for skin he blesses you only because you bless him a man will give up everything he has to save his life but take away his health and he will surely curse you to your face
1758316 are you still trying to maintain your integrity curse god and die
1758317 you talk like a godless woman should we accept only good things from the hand of god and never anything bad
1758318 as you know we consider blessed those who have persevered you have heard of jobs perseverance and have seen what the lord finally brought about the lord is full of compassion and mercy

1758320 wow staples center really goes all out for their guests dont they
1758321 it means they want to pay off their mortgage and exit
1758322 because the proposed purchase price is inconsistent with the use of property as a mitchell lama affordable housing development
1758323 a few months back there was a lot of fanfare it looked like we had been able to save affordability at 1520 all of that is now in jeopardy
1758324 it is simply outrageous for the owners to ignore the tenants offer to negotiate and instead push blindly ahead with their decision to take this building out of the mitchell lama program
1758325 the bank is taking a speculative position by lending money on that property
1758326 the same kind of thinking went into lending 400 000 to someone who had the 50 000 income or someone who couldnt prove their income
1758327 lets be very clear if this cx4 product was from many other vendors wed probably hang out the bunting and heap on the praise however a lot is expected from emc and rather like a child that consistently performs well at school the bar gets set ever higher however by concentrating on addressing user pain points and not just on providing technological advance the cx4 looks to have cleared this higher bar emc is either blessing or leading and either way driving a number of key trends from flash drives and unifying storage platforms to driving greener storage compared to the competition the cx4 offers a very thorough and competent function set although there are other vendors that might beat the cx4 in individual features the new clariion is overall a very solid and comprehensive offering and winning in this particular storage game can be viewed as a decathlon ultimately what matters are general ability and the overall score not the position in each individual event
1758328 gee now that clariion is so big what happens to dmx
1758329 gee now that dmx is so small what happens to clariion

1758331 say what you will about tough times in the financial services sector these days but some investors still believe there are brighter days ahead
1758332 these purchases represent a view that in good times or bad financial institutions are going to need the right technology and infrastructure to succeed
1758333 fiservs leadership has sold part of the group but not all of it because they believe in where the business is going and want to participate in that growth
1758334 however they have big issues on their plate and see the opportunity to bring in stone point capital for their intense insurance experience
1758335 i see the stronger players those which have the resources and wherewithal adding benefit to the industry by providing depth of solutions hopefully investing heavily in r amp d and reducing the number of vendors insurance it executives need to deal with
1758336 u s steel is prepared to cooperate with cn towards the goal of closing the transaction in 2008 but it will not agree to extend the purchase agreement
1758337 therefore we need a decision in this case and we have decided to seek legal relief to allow cn to close on the transaction prior to dec 31 2008
1758338 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1758339 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1758340 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1758341 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1758342 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1758343 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1758344 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1758345 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1758346 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

1758359 the belief is based around the events prior to the day of judgment around the second coming of the christ when ad dajjal who is blind in his right eye shall gather an army of those he has deceived and lead them in a war against jesus who shall be accompanied by an army of the righteous

1758361 in his classic textbook memoirs illustrating the history of jacobinism describing the illuminist plot in france abbe barruel affirms that
1758362 he called me piggy is he insulting me can i complain him
1758363 not really sometimes we called fat people piggy who is that
1758364 im not gonna tell you you know him try to guess
1758365 is he a staff of the club the sport guys the coaches

1758367 its luxurious luxurious luxurious i love the interior layout design and access to controls it is user friendly and very modern
1758368 i have seen a lot of the videos and it brings me to tears
1758369 what some people think is pretty is actually something thats very gruesome and gross
1758370 we have a great opportunity to work and get better and we have some very talented players at key positions and that should certainly lead us to be encouraged
1758371 its a long season and with a new scoring system its going to place new demands on the players and the staff we play a competitive schedule and compete in a great conference and all of those things are certainly going to prepare us to see if we can make another post season run
1758372 the 2008 team is a totally different team because were missing so many components from last years team
1758373 you cant replace the leadership and sacrifice that kate price gave this team if youre missing 40 of your players its hard to think that it is the same team and the same chemistry success always ends up being in the hands of the players it depends on their ability to get along listen work hard and stay healthy
1758374 it would be easy to identify that the outside hitter position is one of our strengths
1758375 there are multiple all american awards garnered within that position already and megan and nicole are both very strong from the endline and attacking from the back row they can hit a variety of sets and are both strong at the net from a blocking standpoint they are a great tandem and if we can keep them healthy and monitor their jumps they are going to be key factors in the success of this years team
1758376 blair and alisha are exceptional blockers and katie and kelsey give us good depth and multiple personnel options
1758377 the right side may not be the main focal point of our offense but certainly their strength is that they are good at the net alisha has had the heaviest arm on the team since she came in as a freshman so we might have opportunities to experiment more with the 6 2 and try some thing we werent able to do before
1758378 in my mind we certainly have one of the better middle attacks in the country in christa and arielle who both have the ability to hit in front of and behind the setter
1758379 kelsey ream could also see time in the middle as she is a calm individual who can enter the game in the instance that we need her and provide a different look and tempo to our opponents were strong in the middle but our success there depends on how the entire squad plays it really isnt a positional breakdown the success of the middle hitters is dependent on how the team plays together and what we need to attack our opponents
1758380 alisha continues to develop into one of the top talents in the country
1758381 in a lot of peoples eyes she was the biggest surprise at the national championship last year because those people hadnt seen us play i know the staff feels great about her development she really grabbed the fifth game against stanford and her competitive desire showed we lost an experienced back up setter so kimi and megan are going to have to be strong at that position to allow us to compete in practice
1758382 we lost a lot in the back row with the departure of some key players
1758383 even though kate price was a former big ten freshman of the year while playing as an outside hitter i felt she was the best clutch passer in the conference and her leadership was very critical to us last season we also lost caitlyn hess four players who worked hard in practice and had the ability to bring great energy to the gym and keep the ball in play with cathy megan kimi and heather coming in i think our back row skills may be a little better than last year but well certainly miss the talents of our departed players

1758388 and he has always let me have my free will but there gets to be a point where he humbles you
1758389 they dont focus on the problem but what causes the problem
1758390 i see a big chunk of difference in my attitude my drug use and my behavior
1758391 that is what i thought the lord was calling me to
1758392 i was probably bitten by the service aspect more than he was
1758393 so i was very excited when he said he had figured out what we would do for the rest of our lives
1758394 brian said are you sure you want to do this now
1758395 from the worlds standpoint it was absolutely the worst time
1758396 i would be at work and every tuesday at 11 15 the phone would ring and i knew it was him asking what to do with this or what do i do with that he had some really faithful volunteers
1758397 were here to help restore lives we provide the hope that christ offers
1758398 its the life change giving my life to god that is really whats doing the change i want to have a good life and not worry about trouble
1758399 we have said that we want to focus on the three sectors industry energy health care and that we want to concentrate on them
1758400 foundered on the shoals of a capricious and rapidly evolving it market
1758401 this has created a challenging environment for our print and tv businesses which has been compounded by the current macro economic climate
1758402 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1758403 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1758404 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1758405 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1758406 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1758407 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

1758409 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1758410 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1758411 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1758412 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1758413 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1758414 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1758415 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1758416 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1758417 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1758418 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1758419 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1758420 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1758421 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1758422 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1758423 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1758424 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1758425 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1758426 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1758427 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1758428 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1758429 who are open to doing something on the production side
1758430 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1758431 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1758432 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1758433 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1758434 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1758435 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1758436 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1758437 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1758438 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1758439 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1758440 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1758441 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1758442 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1758443 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1758444 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1758445 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1758446 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1758447 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1758448 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1758449 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1758450 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1758451 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1758452 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1758453 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1758454 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1758455 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1758456 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1758457 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1758458 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1758459 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1758460 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1758461 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1758462 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1758463 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1758464 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1758465 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1758466 im not happy with him not running out the last ground ball last night

1758499 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1758500 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1758501 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1758502 its a concern because you really want brian to be able to be here practicing and really preparing
1758503 hes a guy we are counting on to create the kind of depth wed like to have for him not to be able to go through these practices right now is probably a negative for us and for him in particular
1758504 to be honest with you it wasnt my main focus
1758505 my main focus was out here what were doing whats best for us im glad that the commissioner made a decision it helps us put this behind us so i wont have to worry about coming up here and getting questions about it
1758506 i know there are relationships coaches to coaches i know coaches with people in the front office coaches with players players with players but its an important message that you need to think about what youre doing

1758508 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1758509 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1758510 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1758511 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1758512 this sort of market manipulation is no more characteristic of short sellers than of bullish investors

1758515 this is potentially damaging not only to the issuers in question but also to confidence in the overall fairness and quality of the uk market
1758516 as the market hears more and more about smart investors taking large positions against hbos they could be tempted to do the same and put in shorts
1758517 this could create the opposite to what the financial services authority wanted and result in much higher volatility in the shares

1758523 i think if he does its because its the only option they are saying either you do this or you come back and youre going to be a backup or you might not be able to play for us at all i never knew you could hold a player hostage who just wants to play football but im finding out something new
1758524 i would be surprised but i dont know youve got to be around him and understand what hes going through it depends on what they are telling him it depends on whats going on behind closed doors
1758525 its a different helm over there a different organization than when i was there
1758526 i dont think when former packers president bob harlan and coach mike holmgren and gm ron wolf were there i dont think this would ever have happened like this
1758527 its one of those things that youve got to pay attention to
1758528 you dont want it to swell its all pretty much being proactive versus where there is a problem thats not the case its just more being proactive with it and careful with it

1758538 it truly is an unbelievable site the architecture of the castle is just terrific you have to see it to believe it
1758539 most of us around here have never really grown up
1758540 are these big kid toys or little kid toys you decide
1758541 needless to say the real kids here are linda and richard
1758542 they are really terrific people very involved and hands on
1758543 castle farms has gone beyond what i ever expected its so great to see it restored to its original status the castle really has a rich history here
1758544 loeb had mules dairy cattle and horses on the farm along with the latest farm equipment from his sears catalog for visitors to view
1758545 from 1969 1999 arthur reibel bought the land reinstated the original name of castle farms and converted the grounds to a concert venue at most 17 000 spectators filled the grounds
1758546 we started in 2003 with 14 weddings and this summer we have 137 scheduled to date
1758547 we just continue to grow and grow for the 2009 summer season we are estimating to host between 150 and 160 weddings
1758548 i was drawn to the beautiful grounds and unique venue of a historic castle
1758549 linda had a vision of hosting weddings here she wanted to restore the castle to its original status and help make brides dreams come true she certainly made this brides dream a reality
1758550 each ceremony site also has its own personal dressing room for the bride
1758551 we have guests traveling from 11 states to attend this wedding my son and his fianc live in las vegas nevada and had everything at their disposal in choosing a venue but they picked beautiful castle farms and northern michigan thats a testimony to this place in itself
1758552 i remember sitting out in the field with my husband richard and larry shawn our general contractor and saying to them wouldnt it look nice to do this and that i remember that moment so clearly
1758553 it really is a group effort around here we try to take everyones thoughts into consideration before we make a decision about the development of castle farms the caterers the wedding coordinators and the entire staff
1758554 we have a very close knit group here like one big family because the management team is so tight the staff can contribute ideas and in turn help us to provide our clients with flawless service
1758555 we created the exhibits and grounds with activities to amuse them this way they can learn and interact with their families while still having fun
1758556 my husband and i wanted to create a place that encompassed history beautiful grounds and gardens and exhibits like the antique toys that visitors could look at and say hey i had that when i was kid it really makes for a fun experience
1758557 the muellers do a lot of research and are continuously working to become more aware of opportunities to make castle farms even more authentic and remaining beautiful
1758558 everyone just loves that they can enjoy a renaissance festival with reenactments like jousting at a real castle this fact makes us unique and different from other festivals

1758561 why am i not enraged that my country has killed or hurt so many people for absolutely no noble cause in my name and with my tacit approval
1758562 but cindy it is not polite to be angry or to use such strong language in public
1758563 horseshit in my opinion every citizen in this country should rise up in anger and demand that george bush and dick cheney not only be impeached and removed from office but be tried and convicted for murder and crimes against the peace and humanity
1758564 at the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
1758565 i just want to make a request to the board that it will be good if local boxers are also ranked like in other countries at the moment we dont know who are the champions and this also makes it difficult for boxers of the various stables to find opponents outside the country because we dont have a local ranking system in place

1758568 they kept us in the dark until the final announcement
1758569 it was suspenseful but it was easier to take because we both knew we were going to win a quarter of a million at the very least

1758580 and having been freed from sin you became slaves of righteousness
1758581 the subject of this work is many times multiplicity that of the particles in endless movement that of the vast contents of the internet that of the users and the dreams they wish to dream
1758582 all this multiplicities get together on the verge of chaos on a process that mixes randomness and strict but complex logics very much alike the processes that take place in our heads even when we rest
1758583 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv
1758584 the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc
1758585 the countdown has officially begun mark your calendars september 18th is the day of reckoning
1758586 for the last three years the entire team at mythic has poured their hearts into making
1758587 omg osam obama is blacck hes gona have all white ppl killeed omg
1758588 its a damn shame thats all there is to it
1758589 we know were missing out on a quality experience for the student athletes but its too big a load to bear
1758590 all the benefits inherent with the conference situation were not enough for us to forget about the travel costs
1758591 there is no room for divorce we cant get into priuses or onto buses and solve our problems
1758592 airlines dont have marketing people now so were dealing with some 800 number or getting some group desk
1758593 you hope to get a deal but its something that is never going away
1758594 we have coaches online just about every day trying to book flights at reasonable rates and theyre nowhere close to where they were before
1758595 its a guessing game you dont know whether to lock in a rate you just hope you get lucky
1758596 in sports where you wish to be competitive youre still going to have to find a way to do it
1758597 theres going to be more pressure on selling tickets more pressure on fundraising
1758598 it was the hardest decision of my career and im suffering a lot to have to let go of my dream
1758599 we fought during four years to get to the olympics and i wont be able to be by larissa on the court
1758600 its not easy to make this decision after so many days of suffering and sacrifice im sorry that she is not in condition to be by my side in this moment that we had dreamed so much for our careers
1758601 i tried everything grabbed all the possibilities given to me by the professionals who evaluated me but unfortunately i reached my limit
1758602 we knew that this could have happened but we always worked with the expectation that i would play
1758603 there was no more time for doubts and the decision had to me mine
1758604 i thought a lot about it and realized that it wouldnt be fair to larissa the technical staff and the brazilian people for me to play without the ideal conditions to do well in the olympics
1758605 i know some people may question why i didnt make this decision earlier
1758606 but i ask would someone give up their dream this easily without fighting until the last minute
1758607 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
1758608 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
1758609 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
1758610 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
1758611 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
1758612 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
1758613 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
1758614 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
1758615 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together
1758616 omg osam obama is blacck hes gona have all white ppl killeed omg
1758617 in order to really get at the issue is there life out there we have to know the best place to look
1758618 and in the case of europa the best place to look is where cracks on its icy surface are active today
1758619 this research feeds that need that i have as a geologist and as a person to be the explorer to be the adventurer to see things that no one else has seen before and figure out things that no one else has figured out before
1758620 and out in the solar system is a great place to do that because there are some things like the plumes on enceladus that we really are seeing for the very first time
1758621 europa has the potential for something very similar to hydrothermal systems we have here in our oceans
1758622 very ancient organisms that thrive on oxidized metals could potentially be centered on one of these oases formed by heat and metals seeping from cracks in the ocean floor
1758623 we dont walk around on earth with our eyes closed we want to know whats going on why things happen
1758624 its like galileo looking through his telescope all those centuries ago and going gosh whats out there its that same spirit of exploration and i just get a real kick out of that
1758625 the type of research were performing is very unique and it requires some pretty mind boggling calculations that could have never been done on our older systems
1758626 with the power of our ibm system were gaining new insights into how these complex molecular switches known as receptors function the computer models help guide experimental design in the lab as well as generate new hypotheses
1758627 with its significant price performance advantages and simplified management capabilities the e1350 linux cluster is the ideal high performance computing platform for the ambitious and important work being done by the researchers at umdnj
1758628 i keep saying im not sure if this is true or not true im making the team and now im the first guy coming to the stadium and the whole world will be watching me carry the flag there are no words to describe it
1758629 in america everyone has a chance to do all these things
1758630 you follow the rules people will choose and if im blessed to get that opportunity ill get it
1758631 i feel happy honored im feeling so blessed to get an opportunity to present the united states of america to present the united states flag in front of my team

1758650 in conclusion family support is more important than community support because oh wait why is it more important what if they dont have families like what if their family all died in a car crash or plane crash or whatever or what if their family had chucked them into the old folks home then they wont have family support so this is not applicable to those who dont have family bless them the poor lonely souls but even if they do have a family wouldnt it be a burden to take care of their grandchildren they make too much noise those annoying little spoilt idiots maybe the grandparents could smack them or else the so called family support can turn into a burden for the elderly i dont know i barely care and this is unfair because i studied for everything under this theme except for ageing population
1758651 you are precious in my sight and honorable and i have loved you
1758652 i was sitting next to jerry colangelo and said you know weve waited three years to get off this plane and do this
1758653 i think were prepared and while were here we need to prepare more

1758655 weve been treated with the greatest amount of respect and friendliness we could not have been treated better i know well get the same treatment in beijing the chinese people love basketball and were excited were playing the first game against china
1758656 i try to see american players every time they come to china but this time is the most special because of the olympics
1758657 a once in a lifetime opportunity and they should experience all those things

1758665 you never know what to expect out of this offense
1758666 coach called a blitzing play and theres no o line in 7 on 7 so im free he threw the ball and i swatted it down
1758667 he said with an offensive line you would have gotten cut
1758668 i talk as much noise as i can to him
1758669 because i know hes a competitor hes going to bring it right back
1758670 were on top of that stuff pretty good but sometimes its through the high school or the clearinghouse or the testing sites
1758671 hopefully it will feel 100 percent by the illinois game
1758672 its just kind of been a few unlucky spells for me
1758673 really ive just missed a few games and one season

1758683 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1758684 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1758685 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1758686 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1758687 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1758688 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1758689 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1758690 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1758691 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving

1758701 we are taking part in this tournament because we want to clearly demonstrate that we the people with disabilities can also excel in sports like other people
1758702 about 160 people with disabilities took part in the tournament and the potential is there
1758703 the military judge abused his discretion in fashioning the sweeping remedy that he did
1758704 unlawful command influence is the mortal enemy of military justice
1758705 the appearance of unlawful command influence is as devastating as actual manipulation of a trial
1758706 there is no evidence that gen mattis relied on col ewers for any information opinions or legal advice
1758707 instead the record shows gen mattis to be an independent commander highly unlikely to be prone to manipulation by his staff officers
1758708 gen mattis used the word never 10 times in answering questions about whether col ewers had provided any legal advice with respect to chessanis case or any haditha case
1758709 never spoke to me about this case nor would i have asked him for any information or advice a strict firewall was maintained
1758710 but we will fight this unjust prosecution as long as it takes
1758711 uganda are outside the required world ranking level but it does provide a useful indication of what a good player david is that the work permit review panel granted the permit
1758712 given the brutal commodity and consumer environment our second quarter comps were very encouraging and our earnings and cash flow yield remained strong
1758713 as the commodities market and operating environment remain both difficult and unpredictable we will continue to look for ways to assist both our corporate and franchise operators through this difficult period while driving top line sales
1758714 were trying to push back against the media and those in europe who are anti america

1758720 for us to prosper in these times spiritual light must burn within us
1758721 the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just
1758722 more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword or anything else which had happened unto them
1758723 alma knew that words of doctrine had great power they can open the minds of people to see spiritual things not visible to the natural eye and they can open the heart to feelings of the love of god and a love for truth

1758727 im very surprised by the margin of victory honestly i never planned on running im just running because they split the job off i know my job ive been doing this for many years already thats the reason i ran
1758728 i think the fact that she already worked in the office was probably the turning point
1758729 this is my first attempt at election and i am disappointed
1758730 but my family and friends have been very supportive theyve been wonderful jim husband worked very hard on my behalf
1758731 its just one of those things i cant hold it against him for running it shouldnt change anything he does a good job and we get along just fine
1758732 its got a massive energy efficiency and renewable program and that much of the low carbon technology of the 21st century is being researched built and rolled out in china
1758733 at the g8 if the facts had been in front of the leaders prime minister harper would not have been able to make the statements that he made
1758734 when we catch up with all the pollution that the developed countries have done to this planet for the past decades since the industrial revolution then we talk
1758735 if anyone wishes to come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
1758736 for whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it
1758737 the current situation at state universities is a sorry one since june 2008 as employees we have failed to come to work because amongst other things the salaries that we get are simply not enough to cover transport costs indeed the pay has at times been enough for transport for two days only and this has demotivated us
1758738 we want to first give our education a zimbabwean identity then a sadc and later african identity our system of education is basically english we are not educated to be zimbabweans or africans but british gentleman and ladies our education makes us white inside
1758739 if you go to germany to learn you come back with a germany education and if it is russia one comes back with a russian education the same applies to japan china america us and britain however when one is educated in africa the person gets a british french or portuguese education why
1758740 a college such as this one should make every attempt to inculcate values of national consciousness this is important so that our students are not swept away by globalisation
1758741 ageing is a privilege and a societal achievement it is also a challenge which will impact on all aspects of the 21st century society
1758742 he should be creepier than he was in spider man 3 you dont want to scare the kids because the kids love the character but i think you could add a little bit of a creep factor i mean it never bugged me to watch frankenstein as a kid so you could have a little bit of it as long as you have a good story backing it up
1758743 im thinking about how they want to make anti heroes nowadays
1758744 those dont work the reason theyre so cool as a bad guy is because theyre bad and as soon as you try to give too much humanity to them then you go no now theyre not as good as a bad guy because youre trying to redeem them
1758745 yes big time actually i think theres more talk now about doing a theatrical film than there ever has been
1758746 now that theyve seen what we can do basically we had a normal pattern budget on
1758747 i personally dont think that can happen as long as were doing the television show not with the same people and thats been the biggest problem we do want to use the same people we want the same people to be involved including the writers obviously theyve got it the hardest because they finish one year and then theyre writing the next theyre talking season 8 ideas already
1758748 i kind of play a baddie definitely a baddie i dont know how much im allowed to say but im a very bad person
1758749 ill tell you if theres anything left of bob orton after that martial arts demonstration youre going to see a monkey jumping out of the closet

1758751 showdown revisiting the top 20 rivalries in the past 20 years
1758752 steve austin and the rock will be on the cover
1758753 there is strong growth coming from the new broadband and telephone enabled homes over 50pc of our national footprint is now broadband enabled
1758754 during the first half of this year we also introduced two speed increases the second increased our top broadband tier to offer 20mbps for 40 a month with unlimited data use
1758755 almost 300 000 of our homes are now upgraded for phone as part of our product offering
1758756 year on year digital tv numbers grew by almost 3pc to reach over 314 000 subscribers overall tv numbers were down for this quarter we attribute this to the reduced number of new builds released during this period as well as seasonal factors
1758757 the thing youre looking for from the nickel position is guys that have the ability to cover in the slot and guys that have the ability to play like a linebacker
1758758 playing the outside corner its you and a receiver there is nobody outside of you in nickel youre inside and everybody is around you so its a whole lot more going on you have a lot more reads its definitely more mentally challenging if youre inside
1758759 you get to blitz more you get a lot more opportunities to make plays but wherever they need me whether its inside outside im willing to play
1758760 i came from tampa bay and i saw ronde barber play nickel for two years ronde barber is one of the best nickels if not the best but antoine is right there with him
1758761 you never know whats going to happen during the season and we always try to prepare guys in practice and move them around chuck knew what was going on hes very very smart chuck understands what everybody in the secondary is doing in each defense so he had no problems
1758762 we say its fruitful because despite the tro there was a lot of business conducted and so here we are never giving up on the peace process itself
1758763 it is signifying that we agree to the draft all the words there are what we agreed upon the annexes are what we agreed upon
1758764 we do not deny that there was a meeting of minds in all the contents of the initialed document what would consummate the agreement would be the affixing of the signatures during the ceremony
1758765 the tro itself tells you that we have not signed it
1758766 some of the statements may have been said out of context but i dont think this will sour relations
1758767 they understand and should understand that the tro must be respected that the judiciary is a separate and co equal branch of government whose decisions must be respected
1758768 contrary to the fears of many sharing natural resources with the government is their moro rebels recognition of the national government
1758769 were pushing for a breakthrough here these noises will calm down when they see the bigger picture we will see there is no cause to be threatened its not only for milf its for whole communities in mindanao we just have to reassure those openly protesting
1758770 even if the comprehensive compact agreement is signed there is still a need to talk
1758771 if the executive branch will do some explaining it should do it before the entire congress
1758772 i think we should have been extended the courtesy of having been consulted
1758773 if an agreement needs sanction approval or ratification of congress there is a need for us to consult the public at the very least
1758774 its not a done deal it still has a long way to go it will face a very rough road
1758775 take 2 was after all said an done only sort of like yesterdays but with far fewer problems time to go

1758783 we used absolutely the minimum force necessary to ensure safe access and entry routes to and from the site
1758784 the police are claiming the vehicles were blocking the emergency exit and were abandoned both of which are lies
1758785 the air now is the best in at least 10 years
1758786 could it be possible that such measures would last longer or even be permanent
1758787 not only do foreign athletes need fresher air we need that too
1758788 most of these measures are long term ones and will remain after the games not all the temporary measures will be retained after the games but they may provide clues for our future work
1758789 beijing has made a lot of effort but these are temporary measures
1758790 this time the olympics have helped to identify the problems and the source of the bad polluters now i think we shouldnt let that go
1758791 were talking about the quality of life and the health of tens of millions of people its more important than the games
1758792 they dont dare shut down or slow down customers need electricity
1758793 soon we will have to close because the more we produce the more we lose
1758794 but ultimately farmers would suffer more and they would have no incentive to plant
1758795 its time for us to give priority to quality rather than speed to make it better not faster
1758796 might feed some people at the moment but they hurt more in the end they should be closed
1758797 from the viewpoint of science the north pole is just another point on the globe but symbolically it is hugely important there is supposed to be ice at the north pole not open water
1758798 the issue is that for the first time that i am aware of the north pole is covered with extensive first year ice ice that formed last autumn and winter id say its even odds whether the north pole melts out
1758799 indeed for the arctic as a whole the melt season started with even more thin ice than in 2007 hence concerns that we may even beat last years sea ice minimum well see what happens a great deal depends on the weather patterns in july and august
1758800 theres a good chance that it will all melt away at the north pole its certainly feasible but its not guaranteed
1758801 last year we saw huge areas of the ocean open up which has never been experienced before people are expecting this to continue this year and it is likely to extend over the north pole it is quite likely that the north pole will be exposed this summer its not happened before
1758802 the government and the energy companies have decided that replacing kingsnorth will be a symbol that britain is able to use a form of energy generation that produces massive amounts of harmful co2
1758803 but we determined that our protest will also be a symbol
1758804 if we can stop this power station being built then we will make it much harder for the authorities to defy public pressure and build other coal fired stations in the future
1758805 when the time is right they will move together streaming into the power station to shut it down
1758806 if the law protects the right of industries to destroy the planet then it is up to people like us to prevent that even if it means breaking the law
1758807 while we completely respect the protesters right to campaign peacefully what is not acceptable are their plans to invade the power station
1758808 power stations are not adventure playgrounds and if anyone does get in they will be putting their safety and the safety of our workers at risk
1758809 what we have found is a bunch of intelligent and articulate people who have set a real example to us
1758810 all that means is that more coal will be burned and the pollution will remain
1758811 no one actually knows how much coal we will need to burn when the new power station is built that depends on market conditions
1758812 we are about pushing for radical social change about the whole way the economy works
1758813 ask something of me and i will give it to you
1758814 the council felt that with the presence of foreign players local players have not been given the opportunity
1758815 many are having problems paying salaries and they cant cope so it is best that we do away with foreign players until the problems are solved
1758816 i was supposed to go to malaysia but that has fallen through now but i have no reason to worry because i am confident that come the start of the new season i will definitely be playing i am still focused on continuing with my career

1758824 the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle
1758825 the superordination of the european categories corresponded to the superiority of the european artillery
1758826 recognizes that for the history of mankind too there is not only an ascending but also a descending branch
1758827 a considerable distance from the turning point at which the historical course of society becomes one of descent
1758828 history moves often in leaps and bounds and in a zigzag line
1758829 the universal evolutionary development of mankind exists only as an abstraction the particular evolutions are various and concrete
1758830 the dispute over the reality or non reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question

1758841 aside from the hit shows which have spawned the networks most of the other shows on these networks have not lived up to their predecessors content wise and new shows are often canceled soon after they are launched this may be an indication of content quality more so than a pre profit phase of a nascent marketplace

1758848 farmers have sold nothing of any consequence for the past 25 t drop there is a big backlog of transactions to do
1758849 the wheat looks fine it is still standing and still quite green thank goodness
1758850 im very pleased with that and it was a nice sample
1758851 it is nice today but it is raining every second day so its not dry enough to get on
1758852 it has certainly damaged the hagberg and protein without a doubt
1758853 but if it doesnt brighten up after the weekend we will be in big trouble
1758854 an elderly gentleman walked into my office inquiring as to the status of the ntp reexams
1758855 seems these third parties are getting a little creative in how they try to access information that should not be made available to them
1758856 its looking good its yielding over 7t ha 3t acre and is 1 5 nitrogen
1758857 we tend to roundup everything to hurry harvest along and keep drying costs to a minimum
1758858 its grey and occasionally rainy but the forecast is better for the weekend
1758859 yields have been above average except for one or two pigeon hit blocks
1758860 i havent gotten rid of anything appliances i havent turned off anything
1758861 the more im around it the more im convinced its possible to go zero energy
1758862 we havent changed our lifestyle any not in the least
1758863 if you are going to tackle climate change and curb energy use you have to deal with consumer devices like pcs
1758864 there are large potential savings beyond what energy star can do
1758865 what were trying to do is raise the visibility of the power consumption problem on the pc desktop and really bring power management to the masses
1758866 calculating your total climate damaging carbon emissions reducing them where possible and then balancing your remaining emissions often by purchasing a carbon offset paying to plant new trees or investing in green technologies such as solar and wind power
1758867 all of our investments in internal efficiencies have very positive returns with paybacks of less than three years
1758868 slash and burn agricultural pressures are clearing the forest there at an intense rate
1758869 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1758870 that will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and bio fuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like off shore drilling clean coal and nuclear power like the power produced at this plant here in michigan
1758871 the essence of the liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held but in how they are held instead of being held dogmatically they are held tentatively and with a consciousness that new evidence may at any moment lead to their abandonment

1758908 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1758909 we can now for the first time move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer based systems
1758910 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
1758911 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
1758912 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities
1758913 theres nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come

1758929 we had a little bit of oilseed rape for niab trials and i think it came in fairly well
1758930 its too early to tell the yield but it looks fairly good as did the quality
1758931 the crops are beginning to lose their brightness and are looking a bit dark

1758939 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1758940 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
1758941 in the last two to three years weve seen a big change
1758942 it used to be that you couldnt ask for more than a month
1758943 initially our core business was artists college students and recent grads renting raw lofts or small unrenovated apartments
1758944 today were renting more and more to financial types and creative professionals looking for similar amenities they have come to expect in manhattan
1758945 possibly at some point this week well issue details of a precise date
1758946 we are negotiating with the u n climate agency to decide on the date
1758947 we had a successfull test run now we have to see that the u n is also ready so settting the date is under negotiation it should be shortly
1758948 this now paves the way for the transfer of credits from the clean development mechanism into the eu registry system
1758949 possibly at some point this week but not today well issue details of a precise date
1758950 it the date for a market link has drifted and drifted
1758951 what you really cant put a number on is the impact on sentiment
1758952 did you think of those seven things today because we havent had a highly effective year yet
1758953 they tend to choose roles where theyre either managing or providing advice
1758954 ivy leaguers probably position themselves better for job opportunities that provide them with significant upside
1758955 state school graduates gravitate toward individual contributor and support roles
1758956 personal lessons ive learned through actually putting my own body in motion and tehereby discovering that suffering as opposed to pain is optional they may not be lessons you can generalize but thats because whats presented here is me the kind of person i am
1758957 im often asked what i think about as i run usually the people who ask this have never run long distances themselves i always ponder the question what exactly do i think about when im running i dont have a clue i dont think much of anything worth mentioning i just run i run in a void or maybe i should put it the other way i run in order to acquire a void essentially im not thinking of a thing all i do is keep on running in my own cozy homemade voide my own nostalgic silence
1758958 wow my lungs are chugging wow my legs are burning when can i stop
1758959 eu vim para chamar os pecadores a fim de que mudem de vida e n o para chamar os bons
1758960 porque deus tanto amou o mundo que deu o seu filho unig nito para que todo o que nele crer n o pere a mas tenha a vida eterna
1758961 weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate
1758962 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1758963 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1758964 if we can understand how we got into this relatively cold climate phase then that can help predict how global warming might push us back out of this phase
1758965 studies like ours that establish when and how climate thresholds were crossed along the way can be used to predict climate thresholds going the opposite direction from cool to warm
1758966 although to be fair were looking at one that is very far away warming would have to be greater than what is predicted for the next one or two centuries to cause a melting of the east antarctic ice sheet the west antarctic ice sheet is much more vulnerable
1758967 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1758968 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet i cannot even imagine how much that is but it is a lot i suppose for any state control is significant as other resources dwindle
1758969 to collate information and predict the way in which the arctic region may eventually be divided up the freezing land and seas of the arctic are likely to be getting hotter in terms of geopolitics
1758970 it is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity
1758971 the overall amount of conflict in a meeting could have an influence on overall voting behavior
1758972 put the responsibility for cutting the budget squarely on the shoulders of each agency head
1758973 top gun is a great chance to share your skills and talents with peers who understand and respect the challenges that pcb layout offers
1758974 we often lack recognition or gratification for the many difficult layout challenges we overcome but this contest will not let these great feats go unnoticed this is an opportunity to see if your pcb layout skills measure up to the expectations of todays high speed layout techniques and to find out if you really have what it takes to be a top gun pcb elitist
1758975 the situation hasnt changed really from day one certainly not for the last five years
1758976 ive been saying at every agm every time ive done interviews that were looking for investment we always have done we always will be and that continues
1758977 i do look at the clubs that have the champions league status that brings in millions and have the multi multi multi millionaires and the billionaires in them and think thats probably what it takes now to get a hugely successful club
1758978 theres a part of me that hopes thats not true but if you look at that top four and the consistency of the top four theres a lot of money floating around it and we at everton do not have that money
1758979 a ground move is certainly crucial to the economic future of everton
1758980 ive said it a million times i love goodison park but we have to move
1758981 we have to get more income into the football club to begin to compete with those clubs weve been discussing
1758982 thats the reason weve been contemplating a move and the truth is weve had enormous support from knowsley enormous support from tesco and we havent from liverpool
1758983 that is one of the ones you can believe in the papers
1758984 he is one of the major targets but there are others who have not made the papers yet thankfully i just want to pull one off if i can just get one of the ones weve been after that will be a start
1758985 there are four or five or even six out there at the moment that we are daily if not hourly trying to catch
1758986 lifes short get a divorce and you need not live in misery or in depression the jaws of the black dog
1758987 if problems exist now or if they can appear later especially divorce and income tax
1758988 theres a joy in having the first molecule of an idea or thought then testing it for a period of time long enough in front of audiences of millions of men and women who surf the internet to determine whether the idea is viable
1758989 do as i do and perhaps you might succeed as i have
1758990 i left my position in industry as house counsel advertising marketing sales manager and then ceo because i finally realized how much i missed the practice of law and began to practice law again on a full time basis

1759087 there remains a serious possibility that it could even raise them this will do little for consumer confidence and spending intentions
1759088 in the short term investors will be concerned about the extent to which the economic slowdown will harm corporate profitability
1759089 investors realise that some sectors have been aggressively oversold and that creates opportunity
1759090 from a corporate perspective expectations of organic growth will be harder to find and therefore increasingly companies will be looking to merger and acquisition activity to try to replace that

1759092 it has been something of a muted days trading despite plenty of news flow
1759093 big news of the day was xstratas bid for fellow miner lonmin this helped lift the mining sector as a whole but the effect on the index was balanced out by weakness in real estate stocks and across the financial sector
1759094 the idea is people from this camp will head down to the power station and using various peaceful methods will close it down for the day
1759095 weve been doing our best to go round the villages and talk to people were planning to disrupt the power station not the local people
1759096 its fluctuated but the tide is turning as people are actually realising that we are here to protest peacefully numbers are going up all the time
1759097 weve got a petition going locally and have about 1 500 signatures
1759098 the fact of the matter is a third of british power stations are going to close in the next 10 years we have to provide that capacity and probably a bit more
1759099 kingsnorth is not the main plank of what we plan to do in the future the majority of the replacement is nuclear

1759117 women in particular need a strong and smart response from the mta

1759121 when the diamond rush began very few people believed the stones were precious in fact a company which had been doing some explorations here even went as far as to say the stones were worthless industrial diamonds
1759122 we had nothing to lose because we had little to occupy our time as street dwellers we collected as many stones as possible and when buyers started flooding in we realised we had made a lot of money
1759123 the whole area is like a militarised zone which can only be accessed by the powerful there are checkpoints leading into and out of marange complete with sniffer dogs
1759124 one of the vice presidents has a big diamond field which is guarded by the military during the presidential campaigns president robert mugabe visited a diamond field together with the first lady grace mugabe we dont know the reason behind the visit but one of the most heavily guarded fields is said to belong to the first family
1759125 unfortunately our clients are not the traditional tourists they are diamond traders who usually hire the services of local prostitutes and many actually pay using the scarce us dollar
1759126 there has been an upsurge in crime and corruption following the discovery of diamonds our cells in the city are full and we are now holding some of the suspects in police cells outside mutare it is either that the suspect stole somebody elses diamonds or sold another person fake diamonds
1759127 most of them are here to pay bail money for friends relatives or spouses engaged in diamond trade
1759128 cases of children dropping out of school are higher in marange where the diamond fields are found
1759129 the explanation from the children and their parents is that they see no need to pursue education when diamond panning can provide instant riches
1759130 after seeing the change in lifestyles of other people in the city
1759131 transactions in most commodities and services such as medical consultations rentals even purchasing firewood are now done in foreign currency even commercial sex workers now demand payment in foreign currency
1759132 i resigned from the civil service just over three years ago and used to ply the border route when it was less lucrative when the diamonds were discovered business improved and i have increased the number of my taxis to four

1759141 i read in the newspaper last week that ngatjizeko had signed with jomo cosmos but the normal procedure is for the south african football association safa to contact the nfa to request for the international clearance certificate itc which the nfa is supposed to inform the club about
1759142 i do not know why they are mentioning my name because the player personally dealt with the club and not through me
1759143 we like mr obama and we hope that he will win the elections

1759146 from a clinical and public health perspective the 11 percent relative reduction in the use of fall related medical services translated into approximately 1 800 fewer emergency department visits or hospital admissions
1759147 in addition to discomfort and disability averted this decrease represents a potential savings of more than 21 million in health care costs on the basis of an average acute care cost of 12 000 per event
1759148 we know intuitively that in healthcare money spent on prevention efforts and early diagnosis and treatment pays dividends later by saving more expensive treatment later
1759149 its extremely gratifying to have these study results to document the return on this type of healthcare investment
1759150 fully two thirds of all fall related hospitalizations are paid for by medicare and since that program is a partnership between our state and federal governments its easy to see how quickly the savings would add up if we could simply prevent these falls
1759151 furthermore since more than half of these patients are subsequently discharged to formal rehabilitation settings there are additional savings to be realized in that regard if we can minimize the incidence of these falls

1759164 more pleasure than you could ever imagine ive become addicted
1759165 a pretty amusing if silly sex romp that will most likely fit the bill if you are looking for something naughty to read
1759166 with her usual strength of character sense of fun and powerfully passionate prose portia da costa shows us that even the lifeless hearts of the undead can still beat with the stirrings of romance
1759167 hotbed is a perfect showcase for portia da costas inestimable talent
1759168 suite seventeen contains all portias trademark treats from the arousing narrative a wicked blend of deviant episodes and an undercurrent of pragmatic and poignant romance
1759169 continuum is an intelligent articulate foray into an erotic world lurking just beneath our civilised society
1759170 witty engaging narrative strong characters and description so vivid the scenes rise three dimensionally from the page

1759173 homophobia versus burlesque in a musical cabaret showdown sexy political satire with razor wire barbs
1759174 our show is just like you a shameless spectacle its not just your fundamentalist hate addiction that fascinates me theres something more
1759175 youre not the type of conservative who hates fags but hides behind slick rhetoric about the sanctity of marriage and family values
1759176 no you are the real deal a balls to the wall lunatic spitting bile with all the conviction and dedication of a man possessed and theres a part of me that can respect that
1759177 you are so utterly loathsome your ideas so mind bendingly facile and your tactics so crassly ludicrous that you provide the perfect mirror to reflect the awesome stupidity of religious homophobia
1759178 it is of the fags by the fags and for the fags designed only to mock the word of god and the servants of god

1759182 recognise respect protect and celebrate all of the loving families they seek to represent
1759183 ill be a president that stands up for american families all of them
1759184 the desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive these are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
1759185 my own experience has taught me this lesson well i was born to a single mother my devoted grandparents helped raise me and then i married the woman of my dreams and had two beautiful daughters
1759186 the love that has blessed each of those households has been strong and sure and i know that millions of families across this nation share the same blessings
1759187 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
1759188 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
1759189 differ from the paradigm of a married heterosexual couple raising their biological children
1759190 thirty seven percent of parent households with children in the home are not headed by married
1759191 since 1940 grandparents have been the primary caregivers without biological parents in the home for approximately 2 percent of all children in this country some 1 6 million children today
1759192 forty percent of all children will likely be raised by unmarried partners living together for a portion of their lives
1759193 lesbian and gay parents are raising four percent of all adopted children in the united states as well as three percent of all children in foster care
1759194 until grandmothers and grandfathers can easily access the government benefits intended to keep their grandchildren healthy and safe until lesbian gay bisexual and transgender parents can have their relationships universally and unquestionably recognised until unmarried parents can access benefits without penalty or derision we will not be doing justice by the millions of american families that do not fit a small minoritys notion of what a
1759195 we are disappointed and saddened that a public leader who is himself an adoptive father would deny the children in americas foster care system the opportunity to thrive as part of a welcoming family
1759196 love makes a family but short sighted positions like senator mccains can certainly tear families apart too
1759197 in a country where more than 125 000 children are waiting for foster parents senator mccain would deny loving homes to children who desperately need them simply because of an outdated prejudice about what a family may look like
1759198 mccain could have been clearer in the interview in stating that his position on gay adoption is that it is a state issue just as he made it clear in the interview that marriage is a state issue
1759199 mccains expressed his personal preference for children to be raised by a mother and a father wherever possible
1759200 however as an adoptive father himself mccain believes children deserve loving and caring home environments and he recognises that there are many abandoned children who have yet to find homes
1759201 mccain believes that in those situations that caring parental figures are better for the child than the alternative

1759233 tools such as the book you and me make three and b b a cuddly teddy bear that goes back and forth to mom and dads might be just what their kids need to help them cope
1759234 frankly many divorcing parents dont handle the situation correctly and sadly act selfishly the innocent bystanders their children suffer the consequences which last long after the divorce
1759235 parents need to be more responsible in how they comport themselves during this tumultuous time from breaking this devastating news to their children to not badmouthing the ex in front of the children to simply allowing the child to love the other parent and shame on christie for making her children go through the public display of their fathers humiliation this may have made her feel vindicated but surely their children will be impacted forever
1759236 although many think divorce is not a big deal anymore because it is so common and socially acceptable the national child development study found otherwise children from disrupted families tend to do less well in school and subsequent careers than their peers they are also more likely to experience the break up of their own partnerships
1759237 were on a mission a crusade to help these children and what better place to reach them than in schools we have b b books and bears in schools in 26 states and are targeting all 50 states at our next launch benefiting care house and oakland county schools on september 19 2008 at the walter p chrysler museum in auburn hills michigan

1759266 anderson did not stop or seize any of the messages that were forwarded to him
1759267 andersons actions did not halt the transmission of the messages to their intended recipients as such under well settled case law as well as a reading of the statute and the ordinary meaning of the word intercept andersons acquisitions of the e mails did not violate the wiretap act
1759268 the information was obtained in a legal manner from a confidential informant who we believe obtained the information legally
1759269 the case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case
1759270 law enforcement officers could engage in the contemporaneous acquisition of e mails just as anderson did without having to comply with the wiretap acts requirements
1759271 internet service providers could intercept and use the private communications of their customers with no concern about liability
1759272 the government could go to your internet service provider and say copy all of your e mail but make the copy a millisecond after the email arrives and it would not be a wiretap
1759273 we crossed a number of scientific barriers in this case
1759274 i think there were a few mike stands that stayed in the truck investigators are going to look for any elements that can help them try to find possible suspects
1759275 are there any fingerprints in the car were any elements left on the scene that might help them find possible leads in this case

1759282 were not making any decisions about brandons ability to compete until the last possible moment
1759283 no ones panicking right now and were all expecting brandon to recover in time to compete on saturday
1759284 i have seen him in pain before many a time and he just grits through it when he landed this time it was different he knew it wasnt just a crunched ankle that he could walk off in 10 minutes my heart broke for him because i know what it feels like all too well to be laying on the side of the floor feeling helpless and having a million thoughts rush through your head
1759285 he came back to the village immediately and went to the polyclinic for some xray and all that jazz i can tell you that b randon has been doing physio every hour possible he has been icing elevating taking an anti inflammatories taping moving massaging stretching he is doing everything he can we are even bringing food to him so that he can take advantage of every second possible to heal in time we are a team and when one is wounded we all help in every way we can i am sending my positive vibes to brandon and so is everyone else
1759286 cases like this send a clear message to those who might be tempted to abuse our computer networks to steal information and harm law abiding people and businesses if you do we will track you down wherever you are in the world we will arrest you and we will send you to jail

1759289 this was a big deal that they finally proved its all linked
1759290 is the priority to get traffic through fast or is it to get traffic through with minimal effects on wildlife
1759291 this is not just any old section of the trans canada highway
1759292 when the construction is complete travel on the highway will be safer and more reliable for tourists residents and truckers
1759293 and there will be fewer traffic tie ups on this crucial national commercial transportation artery
1759294 the big concern is that although animals may not be killed directly on the highway we still dont have a really good understanding of how wildlife movement is being affected
1759295 if safety is a big issue then wouldnt a better option have been to have a really serious speed enforcement campaign for a fraction of the cost of twinning a highway you could have pretty much 100 per cent enforcement of the speed limit in an area like that wouldnt that be a more imaginative way to dealing with safety issues in a national park
1759296 were going to be watching very carefully that those mitigation measures with respect to wildlife crossings and corridors are closely respected

1759486 dogs possess the capacity for a rudimentary form of empathy
1759487 other studies also demonstrated that dogs follow human pointing more likely to tell humans the location of hidden objects when they didnt see the object being hidden and tend to steal food when the humans are looking away or closing their eyes
1759488 as the dogs amazing skills to read human communication cues are thought to have been selected by human over last 15 000 years it is also possible that the same evolutionary process affected their skills to empathise with humans
1759489 another possibility is that contagious yawning and possibly empathy could be a more widespread characteristics among mammals
1759490 it is possible that such contagion coordinate the mood status between the dogs and humans

1759492 are we better off today than we were eight years ago
1759493 a study shows that children growing up in homes with many books turn out the be smarter
1759494 but previous talk was pointing to a september launch on t mobile along with a new celldata option to give some location info based on cell tower usage
1759495 the challenge hamdan v rumsfeld and the fight over presidential power
1759496 he didnt appear to be a high ranking officer of al qaida nor was he known to have participated in any specific terrorist operations
1759497 but from americas perspective he did have certain things going for him because the military tribunal system was brand new the government thought it made sense to try some lower ranking operatives first in case anything went wrong
1759498 hamdan had been with bin laden from 1996 to 2001 a stretch of time that spanned not just 9 11 but 1998 attacks on two embassies in east africa and the 2000 bombing of the u s s cole in yemen
1759499 in response the administration redoubled its efforts pressing congress to authorize the military tribunals which it did by passing the military commissions act during the waning days of the republican congress in the fall of 2006
1759500 finally facing his day in court hamdan is a shell of a man
1759501 according to his lawyers hamdan can no longer meaningfully assist in his own criminal defense he is suicidal hears voices inside his head and talks to himself
1759502 we are not witnessing an epochal war crimes trial the first since the twin towers fell on september 11 2001
1759503 we are not unwinding the al qaida stem we are not at the heart of the matter we are instead watching penny ante stuff a trial the dramatic moments of which have come mostly because hamdan apparently doesnt like his attorney and spars with him at the defense table
1759504 he had knowledge clearly but just as clearly no great urge to fight
1759505 this testimony does not strike me as emblematic of the sentiments and actions of a dangerous jihadist but to paraphrase the architect of the war in iraq you go to trial with the defendant you have not the one you wish you had
1759506 because of the procedural wrangling that preceded it and the lengthy appellate process that is sure to follow it
1759507 but the future interrogation questions for our federal courts are hugely important in the upcoming trials of true al qaida leaders like ramzi binalshibh and khalid sheik mohammed
1759508 thats just one reason why the government is watching the hamdan trial far more closely than you are
1759509 in that sense the fame or infamy of salim hamdan may endure long after his trial does
1759510 pelatihan ini penting untuk mempersiapkan para pemimpin unpad yang akan datang termasuk harus dipikirkan pula bagaimana caranya agar ketika menjadi pemimpin kita tidak membawa baju kedaerahan masing masing tetapi benar benar memikirkan yang terbaik bagi almamater
1759511 untuk itulah pelatihan seperti ini diperlukan untuk membuka peluang munculnya calon pemimpin yang dibutuhkan unpad pada saatnya dalam berbagai bidang
1759512 kemudian untuk angkatan yang sama alangkah lebih baik apabila pelatihan ini dilanjutkan dengan pelatihan yang lain misalnya mengenai quality assurance self assessment dan sebagainya sebagai bagian pengetahuan yang harus dipahami oleh para pemimpin unpad nantinya menjadi pejabat harus visioner dan memiliki kelebihan teknis agar tidak tergagap di lapangan

1759516 i honestly believe this is a perfect time to leave both for my family and for me and for the district as a whole
1759517 at this time we are doing very well from an institutional financial facilities and staffing perspective and naperville 203 is blessed with seven hard working and dedicated board of education members whom i am certain will work with each other and with parents staff and community to find a talented and capable leader who will continue to move this district forward
1759518 therefore we need a decision in this case and we have decided to seek legal relief to allow cn to close on the transaction prior to dec 31 2008

1759524 the overall objective is to develop an iraqi led enduring quality health care system within wasit province
1759525 with improved training facilities medical equipment and supplies iraqi health professionals will be able to take the lead in caring for the iraqi people
1759526 this will allow coalition forces medical assets to take advisory and support roles
1759527 its a good experience for young medics and doctors to get out and see the people of iraq and work with them to help rebuild the country
1759528 we never got a rest or lunch break and didnt even notice we did a lot but there are so many more things we wish we could have done but couldnt

1759542 the public security authorities are currently investigating with their utmost effort
1759543 i think japan and china will further cooperate on this matter to find out the truth as soon as possible
1759544 we had to hide but we had lots of meetings
1759545 we felt that there was no justice or freedom so we decided we had to bring about an uprising that would end single party rule
1759546 columns of people came from all over and where we met in downtown rangoon there were about 500 000 people at the same time in other townships everywhere people were marching for the same things for democracy and human rights
1759547 i was too young i didnt know much about democracy and human rights i only knew that this was really wrong so it was really a spontaneous response
1759548 we were so confident when we saw the people really took to the streets and joined the demonstration it was quite wonderful
1759549 it was the first time i saw my friends and colleagues including some even younger than me get killed in front of my eyes
1759550 many thought that what happened in 1988 would stay in 1988 nobody expected that it would continue but it has survived to this day
1759551 we need a new generation of leaders to hold our flag and 2007 created that generation of students inside the country they are smarter than us and they are growing now
1759552 you can expect spontaneous demonstrations against the military but the problem is that you have to be organised my concern is whether it can lead to a genuine political change
1759553 i spent all of my adult life in the democracy movement and i havent seen any concrete results towards a transition to democracy
1759554 when we collected the rice bags we always promised them you will get democracy one day so i never met my promise
1759555 the voters wanted it they want the policies of the national party

1759563 when the individual was asked he did admit that he had a weapon on him
1759564 at that point it heightens the awareness of those on the checkpoint both police and secret service
1759565 there was at least enough probable cause to stop him as well as a need to talk to this individual
1759566 while blu ray discs offering both 25gb and 50gb are sufficient for users current demands we envision the need for a technology that can support far greater capacities as hd streaming in particular becomes commonplace and users build larger files of digital content the multi layered method is compatible with blu ray devices providing a long term future for the technology and is more easily produced when compared to competing technologies such as holographic storage

1759574 the first is going directly to the federal government namely president felipe calder n
1759575 the second option is requesting the lower house or the senate through their ecology and environment committees carry out an in depth evaluation and declare the definitive closure of this landfill
1759576 in addition to our dialogue with the pertinent authorities we are evaluating the possibility of organizing social protests to halt activities at the landfill
1759577 we want to know how semarnat and the mexico city government reached this kind of agreement without consulting the municipality
1759578 therefore we demand to be given the mechanisms resources and time to remediate and sanitize bordo poniente
1759579 until now we have not received any reports data or analysis to justify the decision much less a copy of the official document extending the landfills lifespan for another four months
1759580 in addition the site is the source of a great deal of atmospheric pollution winds in the mexico valley region blow from north to south and nezahualc yotl is especially affected because it is located south of the landfill
1759581 so far there have been no public analyses of the negative impact the site has caused for the last 20 years
1759582 we wanted to challenge the notion of kids will be kids
1759583 what we found through this process are four examples of outstanding young people who are showcasing the values so often associated with personal responsibility
1759584 additionally this was the first project weve worked on with hill holliday liberty mutuals agency of record and it proved to be a wonderful opportunity to illustrate this new division of time inc which has the bandwidth and expertise to fulfill clients desires in all forms of moving images whether film television or web video we very much value the relationship and are already in discussions to continue to do similar work for not only liberty mutual but also other hill holliday clients

1759688 there was no detectable change in air quality at least for the particulate matter which is the number one concern

1759754 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children

1759759 i hope he gets 100 of the european vote because hopefully hell get 0 of the american vote
1759760 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
1759761 mccain is a jerk and the big o is wonderful

1759764 after the split we never asked your chairman to join our party instead at the flate of your g secretary he asked us to have a merger again and we told him it is not so simple and this is not the time you can confirm it with your g sec
1759765 imdad qazi and chacha maula bux were expelled from cmkp without any reason and before the congress they requested to withdraw the expulsion letter but your people refused thats why they walked out and had a seprate congress confirm it with your seniors if any one left to tell the truth
1759766 would you please pause for a second and read our email again in your enthusiasm you have far fetched things and drawn conclusion which we never meant we just tried to clarify those lies which your comrade hamza put forward about the disintegration of communist party of pakistan after the pindi conspiracy case about imdad qazi and khrushchevs national democracy we think it was malicious dishonest and delibrate you didnt answer or subsanciate any of those lies but you embarked upon questioning our moral credibility instead of asking your comrade to stop telling lies
1759767 we never denied the contribution of mao in the world communist movement especialy on united front
1759768 nine commentaries on the open letter of the central committee of the cpsu by the editorial departments of renmin ribao peoples daily and hongqi red flag
1759769 once again in 1968 at the burdwan plenum on ideological issues the cpi m had to carry forward this relentless struggle against modern revisionism advocated by the cpsu headed by khruschchev
1759770 the 20th congress of the cpsu must also been seen in this light as an attempt made in the name of estimating the correlation of forces under changed circumstances the victory over fascism and the consequent international developments heightened the prestige and increased the influence of world socialism in general and ussr in particular but instead of utilising these positive factors for enriching socialism the gross distortion of the leninist concept of peaceful coexistence and the advocacy of peaceful competition and peaceful transition by the cpsu leadership under khruschchev threw the door open for revisionism and class collaboration of the worst kind as a consequence many a communist party was virtually decimated leaving the international communist movement much emasculated
1759771 we never accused any of your leaders after the spilt as hamza and other members of your party did
1759772 we wanted to send you some of our circulars on national question but now we think it will be an excercise in futality however we are open to have any idialogical and political discussion

1759776 i think mom also had a good time when she was there
1759777 she loves hosting people and always having a casual setting and as ive said before people havent seen her silly side enough and she was definitely much more playful with everyone up there
1759778 this is much better than washington d c isnt it

1759781 its really a film noir about a hollywood starlet that tara did to promote her line
1759782 its such a mantra for the wmc and some corporate leaders to talk about milwaukee and wisconsin trying to chase business away with their tax policies
1759783 really the opposite is true the state and city have bent over backwards to have a favorable tax structure
1759784 its frustrating that huge corporations such as microsoft merck pharmaceuticals and mcdonalds are paying less income tax than you and i
1759785 the issues that will appeal to latino voters are the same issues that will appeal to all voters and those are pocketbook issues
1759786 john mccain doesnt need an introduction to the hispanic community as barack obama needs
1759787 john mccain has been working for more than two decades for the values positions and issues the latino community cares about
1759788 for the latino community well i think for everyone in general the main concern is the economy which affects everything
1759789 plus the price of gas the war in iraq but mostly the economy
1759790 now mccain supports enforcement first and then hell get to legalization of undocu mented workers
1759791 obama recog nizes that we need a comprehensive approach and that we should create legal avenues for students and families of workers
1759792 larrabee estar basada en una serie de n cleos m ltiples
1759793 the movement of funeral processions across town affects the comfort of tourists while also generating an atmosphere of sadness and unhappiness
1759794 furthermore these processions put peoples lives at risk as the heavy summer traffic grapples with the towns congested streets
1759795 in modern society death is no longer an event shared among the community but an aspect of private life
1759796 the aim of this measure is to encourage the development of tourism in accordance with eu rulings

1759826 das 1000 km rennen lebt am 17 august auf dem n rburgring wieder auf ist das heimspiel auch f r audi etwas besonderes
1759827 selbstverst ndlich ist das 1000 km rennen auf dem n rburgring f r audi etwas besonderes im rahmen der lms ist es unser heimrennen wir haben die m glichkeit den deutschen fans unseren r10 tdi zu pr sentieren und ganz nah am geschehen zu sein der r10 startet erstmals in deutschland au erdem haben wir hier bereits 2004 mit dem r8 am ring gesiegt das m chten wir nat rlich gerne wiederholen und freuen uns auf ein spannendes rennen
1759828 wie hat sich das team in der zeit nach le mans auf dieses rennen vorbereitet
1759829 die wochen seit le mans haben wir genutzt um einige tests zu absolvieren aber auch die fahrzeuge bis ins letzte detail zu berpr fen und wieder f r das n chste rennen auf vordermann zu bringen au erdem gab es ein bisschen urlaubszeit und damit die m glichkeit ein wenig die batterien aufzuladen
1759830 in den bisherigen drei saisonrennen hat der gro e rivale peugeot gewonnen es wird also zeit f r einen audi sieg
1759831 bisher ist das so wir setzen alles daran dies zu ndern le mans hat gezeigt dass die konkurrenz weiterhin mit uns rechnen muss die mannschaft ist stark und nach dem erneuten erfolg beim schwersten rennen der welt hoch motiviert
1759832 auf jeden fall d rfen sich die fans freuen in einem langstreckenrennen wie wir es betreiben wird dem zuschauer sehr viel geboten vor allem viele fahrzeuge unterschiedlicher klassen und hersteller auf h chstem niveau und viele berholvorg nge es wird fast st ndig berholt und pausenlos action geboten durch die dauer des rennens von rund f nf stunden ist das motorsportereignis 1000 km rennen schon ein ganz spezielles
1759833 neben der american le mans serie und dem 24 stunden klassiker in le mans ist audi mit dem r10 tdi jetzt in der lms am start hat die europ ische le mans serie eine gro e zukunft
1759834 die akzeptanz der american le mans serie und der 24 stunden von le mans zeigt das interesse an diesem sport der faktor zeit spielt eine ganz andere rolle als bei einem sprintrennen speed und zuverl ssigkeit sind die h chsten gebote in einem so langen rennen wir wollen aktiv mitarbeiten und helfen dass diese serie den stellenwert und die akzeptanz bekommt die sie verdient hat
1759835 der reiz der le mans serie liegt nat rlich darin dass es eine europ ische serie ist aber auch die tatsache dass sie noch relativ in den kinderschuhen steckt sie hat unheimliches potenzial den langstreckensport auch in europa noch popul rer zu machen zudem ist es f r audi selbstverst ndlich eine sehr gute pr sentations plattform
1759836 wie f llt ihr fazit mit den sportwagen aus der le mans sieg berstrahlt in diesem jahr doch wieder alles oder
1759837 nat rlich ist le mans immer das highlight des jahres

1759863 is an interesting development guess some of the statistics finally caught on like this one 89 percent for mere possession taxpayers are stuck with the multibillion dollar bill for these hundreds of thousands of marijuana arrests which consume 4 5 million law enforcement hours the equivalent of taking 112 500 law enforcement officers off the streets

1759886 i do feel really bad for aaron but i think its the right decision

1759924 it is not our standard practice in official statistics to rank schools either by their raw grades in national curriculum tests and other qualifications or by their cva scores
1759925 we do occasionally release lists of the most improved maintained schools in the country
1759926 in both cases the range between the upper and lower confidence limits includes 1 000 so both schools are achieving average outcomes their performance is about as expected
1759927 no meaning can be attached to an absolute cva value and any ranking of schools by their cva values is meaningless
1759928 the top 100 schools using the contextual value added measure
1759929 scores above 1 000 represent schools where students on average made more progress than similar students nationally while scores below 1 000 represent schools where students made less progress
1759930 a measure of 1 006 means that on average each of the schools students achieved the equivalent of one gcse grade higher in one subject than the average attained by similar students
1759931 conversely a score of 994 means that the schools students achieved one grade lower in one subject on average while a score of 952 means that students achieved on average one grade lower in each of their best eight subjects
1759932 the data are only as good as the process that produce them and only reflect attainment as measured by specific exercises undertaken on a specific day
1759933 objections will always be possible it may be argued that assessment is flawed or the exercises test only certain kinds of attainment in certain ways
1759934 imperfect as they inevitably are these assessments have been developed and honed over time and their reliability is high

1759964 that single contribution is more than the rewards we usually offer
1759965 it is gratifying to see the support for identifying and apprehending those responsible for these acts the campus community is encouraged by the seriousness of the response to these acts and the support being shown by law enforcement agencies individuals and the humane society in acting quickly to encourage people with information to step forward
1759966 we wanted to let people know that if you care about the protection of animals you have to care about the protection of people as well

1759977 hes really throwing strikes a lot more compared to the past
1759978 i think sometimes he loses a little bit of focus on the mound when things go bad a lot of that is immaturity and inexperience which he will get better at as he pitches at this point theres no doubt hes a big league prospect
1759979 i was very happy that the astros gave me permission to go home to richmond those were the first games ive missed as manager in 10 years but if ever there was a time that would be it

1759992 when i first learned of the child abuse allegations against the noted pediatrician learning expert and founder of
1759993 please be advised that the presentations for the community on the evening of april 8 2008 and for the staff during the day on april 9 2008 by dr mel levine have been cancelled we have just learned from published news accounts that dr levine has been accused in a civil lawsuit of child abuse although the district has no way of knowing whether the allegations are true the district has decided to cancel the events due to the seriousness and the nature of the charges
1759994 the five men who have filed lawsuits against dr levine say they do not know one another but their charges are similar during physical examinations which parents were discouraged from attending the boys ages 5 to 13 were asked to strip naked and stay that way for the entire exam they were then allegedly touched inappropriately because of the nature of the accusations these men have chosen not to disclose their identities to the public their names however are known to defendants one plaintiff is in prison mr durso said because of a serious charge relating to carrying a firearm since mr durso held a news conference last spring he says 43 former male patients or their mothers speaking for them have also said they were victims of abuse all were treated at childrens hospital or at the university of north carolina those from north carolina are represented by elizabeth kuniholm a lawyer working with mr durso ms kuniholm says four men and the parents of two others told their stories to the north carolina medical board she does not yet know how many will sue one of those men now 28 agreed to meet with the times because his father and sister are prominent educators who do not want to tangle publicly with dr levine he asked that his name not be published he said he was not planning to sue the visits with dr levine began when he was 9 his family had moved and he began struggling in school his parents worried that he might have a learning disability medical records sent to the times by ms kuniholm confirm that this man was a patient of dr levine for several years with regular visits and physical exams in addition the times interviewed the father who took him to many appointments and confirms that dr levine routinely gave his son a physical exam alone in the room the young man said he remembered only the first two visits clearly he recalled a series of tests related to reading and math given by dr levines associates he said dr levine met with his parents to discuss the results then sent them to a waiting room while he conducted a physical examination my mom remembers thinking it was unusual that i was there for educational issues and that he would take me into an exam room unattended he said but my mom didnt want to protest because she trusted him in the room he was asked to strip he said he remembered sitting nervously on the exam table and staring at his clothes on the floor dr levine he said told him he was very special and rubbed the boys penis until it was erect at the same time he asked if the boy had wet dreams he said dr levine was wearing gray pants and had an erection as he brushed against his side then the exam was over the man said he did not tell his parents at that time because he felt ashamed he came forward he said when he read about the lawsuits in a newspaper it enraged him that dr levine had prospered and he wanted to corroborate the accusations what i cant understand now he said is why this was allowed to go on for so long points in defense of dr mel levine dr levines defenders make several points none of the complaints were ever substantiated the similarities are also suspicious said edward f mahoney a lawyer representing dr levine in the current lawsuits his firm martin magnuson mccarthy amp kenney represented dr levine in 1988 as well frankly we think there is a copycat element he said dr coleman who worked with dr levine in north carolina for two decades added that dr levine had seen thousands of patients and that most remained loyal and grateful he had a huge follow up population of kids who have been coming back over and over dr coleman said based on his lawyers statements dr levines defense will most likely rest on the idea of standard practice dr levine has not denied that he examined the boys genitals but his lawyers have issued statements explaining that the accusations were most likely based on distorted or misinterpreted memories the exams they said were medically necessary even for children with learning and emotional difficulties a thorough assessment includes a complete physical and neurological examination the lawyers wrote examination of a childs genitals can give the doctor important information about genetic disorders physical maturity hormone problems hernias or conditions relating to the testicles and other medically important issues dr nancy a murphy chairwoman of the council on children with disabilities for the american academy of pediatricians called the statement fair but only for an initial exam dr murphy who is not familiar with dr levines practices said that typically the primary pediatrician would check for physical problems and the consulting doctor would administer neurological exams she added every time the kids come in they dont need a complete physical examination all the men in the four lawsuits say they were subject to at least two physical exams dr coleman dr levines colleague said he stopped conducting physical examinations years ago but he defended dr levine he is more thorough and more traditional than the average practitioner dr coleman said no one ever called in 1988 a 17 year old man filed a lawsuit alleging that starting when he was 7 dr levine who was then at childrens hospital treated him for bowel trouble and sexually abused him court records show that in a letter dated october 1985 just months after dr levine had departed for north carolina the mans mother wrote dr david weiner then the president of childrens hospital to alert him to her concerns in the spring of 1984 she wrote while my son and i were on the way to childrens hospital he told me that he was frightened about the examination dr levine would always examine his testicles while chriss penis touched or was located very close to the doctors cheek she wrote but the mother said no one from childrens hospital ever interviewed her or her son dr weiner said he could not recall the specific event and therefore did not feel comfortable commenting on the case in a written statement childrens hospital said there were no complaints about dr levine until after he left in 1985 michelle davis a spokeswoman for the hospital said the institution had investigated the accusations and found that dr levines care had been appropriate within the context of the childs medical needs the university of north carolina says childrens hospital never relayed information about the complaint karen mccall a spokeswoman for the medical school and hospitals said they learned of the case from dr levine sometime after it was dismissed in 1991 the hospital did not do an investigation she said because it doesnt have a protocol to investigate dismissed lawsuits in november 1993 the board of registration in medicine in massachusetts received a similar complaint the man whose name is not available to the public said that as a child he had seen dr levine for bowel trouble in the late 1970s dr levine would lay me on the examination table nude he wrote the board and play with his penis and discuss his wet dreams in a detailed reply to the board dr levine said that he did not remember the patient but that examining testicles was medically necessary and that children particularly adolescents needed to discuss their sexuality the board accepted dr levines response but russell aims the boards spokesman said there was no evidence that the board had contacted the man filing the complaint standards for investigations had changed mr aims added and today the complainant is always contacted in massachusetts such complaints are a matter of public record once closed but the medical board is not required to notify the doctors hospital if there is no formal discipline the board and dr levine never informed the university of north carolina about this second complaint ms mccall said like most hospitals however the university of north carolina does ask its doctors as part of their credential application which must be filed every two years whether they have been the subject of complaints even unfounded ones ms mccall said that because of legal restraints about personnel files she could not say whether dr levines credential application omitted such information dr levines lawyers declined to comment next steps in the mel levine cases what will happen next for dr levine is unclear the lawsuits may take years to litigate in april he voluntarily suspended his license while being investigated by the north carolina medical board the board does not discuss investigations but a person familiar with it said the earliest a decision could be made on dr levine would be in the fall meanwhile throughout the spring dr levine continued lecturing and promoting all kinds of minds which pays him an annual licensing fee mary dean barringer the chief executive of all kinds of minds said most parents were incredulous over the accusations she added that dr levines work would not be compromised even if the allegations were true we wouldnt back away from using the incredible groundbreaking ideas and compassion in understanding how childrens minds work ms barringer said
