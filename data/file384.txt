3840015 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle

3840030 alcohol consumption increases ratings of attractiveness of facial stimuli and this effect is not selective for opposite sex faces
3840031 we did not observe marked effects of alcohol on self reported measures of mood suggesting that the effects on ratings of attractiveness were not due simply to global hedonic effects or reporting biases
3840032 to me it seemed more gimmicky a hot chick in the future who does parkour than substantive to me the first person perspective really didnt work for a game where youre trying to manipulate a character through complex spatial puzzles and the challenge often felt more about timing can you jump off this ledge with enough speed at the very last second than brains

3840089 we hope to bring smiles back to the people and the children
3840090 we want to put smiles back on their faces after years of misery in addition to the enjoyment people will get from watching them they will present opportunities for students and the public to learn about this and other endangered species
3840091 this is exemplary of how people in iraq are taking the lead to improve the circumstances in iraq
3840092 our port visit to umm qasr demonstrates the great confidence we have in our iraqi partners and reflects the marked improvements in security that they have achieved within the past several months
3840093 this visit gave us a chance to interact with senior iraqi navy leadership and further enhance coalition cooperation with the iraqi navy and marines
3840094 not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse
3840095 we cannot continue with the situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to this problem
3840096 what we must do now is ensure that its a lasting ceasefire and that there is humanitarian aid which we are prepared to provide for those who are casualties of what has been a terrible set of events
3840097 its also important and we are prepared to contribute to this that there is humanitarian aid for the people who have been displaced and for the cities and towns that have been brought into danger
3840098 more and more people are coming to understand that our actions have consequences for the natural world around us and theyre wondering how they can reduce their impact on the planet
3840099 many of these grants will be used to give young students hands on lessons and conduct workshops for teachers on such critical issues as renewable energy climate change water conservation air quality and acid mine drainage helping students and the public understand issues like these is the first step in finding solutions to our most pressing environmental challenges
3840100 films about developing countries often portray people as victims faced by terrible obstacles in this series we show theyre also people trying to make tough decisions that may change lives
3840101 this is a historic day for the state of michigan
3840102 we must ensure that our great lakes are protected and preserved for generations to come and this legislation fulfills that promise
3840103 i applaud governor granholm and the state of michigan it is gratifying to see our region uniting as never before to protect the great lakes we must now build on this momentum working with our congressional partners to turn these protections into law
3840104 because by serving you demonstrated you were as good as anybody else and therefore you should not be denied
3840105 the truth is we do like to blame the federal government and rightly so the highway system was a national interstate defense highway system when it was created a half century ago
3840106 our national economy is continuing to pose enormous challenges for our working families
3840107 we cannot afford to wait for help from washington or for the situation to grow worse that is why we are moving forward with a pennsylvania solution to grow our own economy and create jobs for pennsylvania workers
3840108 we know this strategy will work because we have proven it before
3840109 when i took office in 2003 pennsylvania was trailing the nation in job growth and had spent most of the prior four years with a higher unemployment rate than the nations jobless number
3840110 our investments paid off even in these tough economic times pennsylvania has added jobs in four of the past six months while the u s as a whole has consistently lost jobs and our unemployment rate is lower than the nations
3840111 here in erie with todays announcement we will have invested 330 million in new state funds since 2003 erie now has 5 500 more people working than in january 2003 and unemployment is down by more than 18 percent
3840112 the 411 bridges in this years accelerated repair program will require enough concrete to build 16 000 homes which would be equal to a 60 percent increase in new home construction
3840113 in addition that bridge work will demand enough steel to build four eiffel towers
3840114 its striking how many states have taken on poverty as a top policy priority
3840115 no one even used the word poverty in the past it was all about helping working families
3840116 these new state and local efforts are important because they reflect a greater level of engagement and commitment by legislators and governors
3840117 states are also putting pressure on the federal government to do more
3840118 a lot of initiatives dont produce good results the political support is there now but if you want an impact on poverty you need a 10 year program
3840119 were bringing people together at the table so the efforts arent just haphazard by individual entities but collaborative and holistic in their approach
3840120 when we showed lawmakers how much poverty and extreme poverty was in their districts it really did change their minds they understood the urgency of taking action
3840121 i will not raise taxes on the people of california period
3840122 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3840123 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
3840124 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick
3840125 the pool of individuals who are u s born and have insurance still make up a huge number

3840131 martha jones ex time traveler and now working as a doctor for a u n task force has been called to cern the worlds largest particle physics laboratory in geneva where theyre about to activate the large hadron collider lhc
3840132 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france
3840133 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
3840134 do wind turbines take away from the scenic beauty of p e i
3840135 one thing we know from the exit survey is that a large portion of the first time visitors to p e i who come because of the scenery and do the wind turbines affect that perception that really was one of the underlying themes of the survey
3840136 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting

3840138 the decision to have one girl lip sync anothers voice during a song featured in the beijing games opening ceremony was not about who was cuter but about achieving the best overall performance
3840139 directed at the organizers for not going public with the decision rather than at miaoke whose performance was highly praised

3840146 georgian ports and airfields would be taken under control of the american military for the establishment of humanitarian and other missions for the defence of people this announcement is very important for defusing the situation

3840148 having the opportunity to represent the multi national division baghdad command as a voting assistance officer is an awesome opportunity
3840149 i try my best to ensure that i give a 100 percent effort to any and everybody who comes in my section to ask about voting
3840150 ive had junior soldiers to officers pull me in the hallway or in the dining facility and say hey what do i need to do to vote
3840151 its a simple process but i think one of the biggest challenges that we are going to have here while in theater is just getting the word out
3840152 i think a lot of times people think the process is harder than it is when it really only takes five minutes
3840153 weve signed up about 180 people in the last five weeks
3840154 soldiers are at the core of an organization that protects democracy protects the rights that we believe in
3840155 every person every soldier from the lower enlisted to the highest ranking has a part to play in voting because every issue or every policy every directive that comes down from our higher our commander in chief affects us all
3840156 being able to have an opportunity to at least put a word in edgewise
3840157 did the author innocently write that out of sincere ignorance or was it another of the many attempts to degrade the religion of islam and its followers muslims
3840158 hey a kindle i didnt realize people really used those
3840159 when the economy takes a turn for a worse everyone starts tightening their belts
3840160 but one place that is often overlooked is the amount of taxes they pay
3840161 we have found that the wealthiest people in the country are paying as little as 5 of their income in taxes while the average person is paying upwards of 30 50 of their income in taxes
3840162 its amazing how im going to save and how much this is going to help me this year it looks like im going to save 30 000 in taxes
3840163 meaning that half of the income that i usually pay in taxes im going to get to keep
3840164 it is important for people to realize that americans are making far more money than they are actually taking home
3840165 a very large percentage of their weekly salary is lost to taxes before they ever cash a check this money can be recovered and used to pay for rising expenses when you realize just how much money you are losing right off the top tax savings is like getting an instant pay raise from the government
3840166 as wonderfully beautiful as as when the sligo illuminators gave free reign to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the barmecides
3840167 but the very misfortunes of a temporal kind that have fallen on ireland have sent forth the children of that unhappy land to every clime and every latitude and wherever they are found not only do they cherish fond memory for the apostle of their native land but they propagate it and make the infection as if it were contagious
3840168 it is a strange time to maintain the theory that a distinctive culture cannot exist without cultural intercourse but since the mainspring of our freedom was not political theory but the claim that ireland possessed and could develop a unique culture of her own it is seasonable to examine this claim
3840169 i think there are two ways in which place is known and cherished two ways which may be complementary but which are just as likely to be antipathetic one is lived illiterate and unconscious the other learned literate and conscious in the literary sensibility both are likely to co exist in a conscious and unconscious tension
3840170 which relate the original meanings of place names and constitute a form of mythological etymology
3840171 in order to read the full meaning of the name and to flesh out the topographical record with its human accretions
3840172 the lovely lakes of killarney the ruins of clonmacnois cong abbey glen inagh and the twelve pins irelands eye the green hills of tallaght croaght patrick the brewey of messrs arthur guiness son and company limited lough neaghs banks the vale of ovoca isoldes tower the mapas obelisk sir patrick duns hospital cape clear the glen of aherlow lynchs castle the scotch house rathdown union workhouse at loughlinstown tullamore jail castleconnel rapids killballymacshonakill the cross at monasterboice jurys hotel s patricks purgatory the salmon leap maynooth college refectory curleys hole the three birthplaces of the first duke of wellington the rock of cashel the bog of allen the henry street warehouse fingals cave all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time
3840173 we irish should keep these personages much in our hearts for they lived in the places where we ride and go marketing and sometimes they have met one another on the hills that cast their shadows upon our doors at evening if we will but tell these stories to our children the land will begin again to be a holy land as it was before men gave their hearts to greece and rome and judea when i was a child i had only to climb the hill behind the house to see long blue ragged hills flowing along the southern horizon what beauty was lost to me what depth of emotion is still perhaps lacking in me because nobody told me not even the merchant captains who knew everything that cruachan of the enchantments lay behind those long blue ragged hills
3840174 a blazing love of place and a fond memory for the lost generations of the tribe
3840175 i should be glad if we could do without coal
3840176 the well being of england and the english people a pride in its ancient history its ancient traditions the very language of its grey skies and rocky shores
3840177 men lived in a world where anything might flow and change and become any other thing and among great gods whose passions were in the flaming sunset and in the thunder and the thunder shower had not our thoughts of weight and measure
3840178 no landowners in any other country ever knew their territories as these caels knew theirs since in the literature land and literature were almost indivisible every bluff and brake they looked on they were aware was known at the other end of the country because it had at some time or other been enshrined in verse or a heoic tale
3840179 there is something here that is nowhere else its away far back and away deep down a man going down a moonlit road from a fair may know it or a child reading on a broken sill of niam or aideen or maeve but they will tell you no name for it they will look away from you and the tears will come with a sudden rush but the cry is within them forever and neither money nor mating will make them happy
3840180 look at that stingy thin and wrinkled face of the returned yank and learn a lesson from it

3840182 dont be hard michael boy theres a good time coming you wont have to face what i had to face the struggling with landlords and the law the law that would leave a rich man poor and a poor man broken
3840183 i had come upon a reality i had discovered where my own roots could find comfort in a sense of the past
3840184 les celtes vent les plus ancien peuple de la terre leur langue mere des autres langues sest conservee presque intact dans le bas breton ils etaient des profondes philosophes
3840185 the celts are the oldest people on earth their language mother of all other languages is conserved almost intact in low breton they were profound philosophers
3840186 on this one day in the year an irishman is a man
3840187 with teeth like that i could have swallowed up paris and much of the rest of the world into the bargain as it was i had a good bite of it
3840188 when her characters make declarations of love they deaw blood
3840189 old roues old courtesans aping the women of the middle class
3840190 adorned and powdered as in some alexandrian tale retold by pierre louys
3840191 i have not come near those men whom others call great they have not sought me
3840192 with her nose and forehead covered with yellow pollen her hair in disorder and full of twigs a bump here and a scratch there her face innocent of powder and her neck moist stumbling along out of breath she was just like a bacchante after libations
3840193 but when the din was at its height there would be my mother peering through a big brass rimmed magnifying glass lost in wonder as she counted the branched crystals of a handful of snow she had just snatched from the very jaws of the west wind as it flung itself upon our garden
3840194 deserted in the form of a little enclosure with a trellis and a sloping roof she wanted the jungle to be virgin but even so inhabited only by swallows cats and bees and the huge spider balancing atop his wheel of lace silvered by the night
3840195 the cruel little queen who hands out poison and knives to an entire imaginary people
3840196 every marriage maintains itself by means of a grain of hatred
3840197 she is a cat in heat for whom life is a succession of roof tops
3840198 the sexual inventions of humanity are nearly all anterior or even exterior to man there is not one whose model even perfected is not offered him by the animals
3840199 the bold female scaraboea adroit chalicodomes cold wise lycoses and proud terrible mantes
3840200 in the insect world the male is the frail elegant sex gentle and sober with no employment save to please and to love to the female the heavy work of digging of masonry and the danger of the hunt and of war
3840201 if the animal moving towards us so securely in a different direction had our kind of consoiousness it would wrench us around and drag us along its path
3840202 these indeed these oonfidants of the whole the animals who are most at home in a broader segment of oonsciousness most readily oonduct us once again across and are near to the medial condition
3840203 in front of the pink curtains barred by the sun he danced black as a dainty devil on a grill but as he drew near the bed he became white again in silk pyjamas doe skin mules
3840204 especially his lashes his lashes are he stared at cheris lashes lustrous and thick and at the shadow they shed over the brown black and blue white of his eye

3840313 youre constantly bombarded by what other people non members outside the church are telling other people about what our faith is how it works and what the doctrines are the unfortunate thing is that 99 9 of the time the things these folks are telling other people are totally incorrect and are in most cases out and out lies now in many instances some of these people are just repeating what someone else has told them because they dont know that its inaccurate and they dont know any better than to repeat misinformation nevertheless in some of these cases they are premeditated theyre falsehoods perpetuated by certain individuals who have an agenda
3840314 i can understand why he would say that on the other hand after thirty two years of hearing the same old misinformation being repeated time and again it gets old so a person has a choice to make he can either sit by silently allowing the misinformation to be perpetuated which leads to further misunderstanding or he can stand up and say excuse me what youre saying is incorrect thats not what our faith is about those are not our doctrines thats not what we teach

3840320 he was missing with his pitches but mostly to one guy
3840321 youve heard all the talk about liriano im sure did that have any effect on you mentally as you pitched tonight
3840322 the small forward is exchanging words with his new teammates even before setting foot in his new locker room
3840323 thats not going to change im never going to change my culture yao has played with a lot of black players but i dont think hes ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture once yao ming gets to know me hell understand what im about
3840324 if you go back to the brawl thats a culture issue right there somebody was disrespecting me so hes got to understand where im coming from people that know me know that ron artest never changed
3840325 yao ming and luis scola spent wednesday morning furiously exchanging test messages and opinions after word of the deal broke out of houston
3840326 because in the games we play against him i hate him
3840327 when i text messaged with luis we talked about team chemistry thats only what worries us
3840328 we worry about the new attitude to the team we are adding talent to the team and we need that but building team chemistry is important this is not bad i dont mean he is not welcome to houston but a new player always needs some time
3840329 also he was the biggest part of a team in sacramento he was a star player we need more chemistry and more communication
3840330 hes a good player why should i not be excited
3840331 he brings defense he brings talent he brings athleticism thats a lot
3840332 we will think about it of course hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands
3840333 i havent talked to ron yet so its hard to say i have to find a way to talk to him and see what we can do as a basketball team he has a history but we know he is a physical player he is a good player he really can help us and ron is on a contract year too
3840334 i think ron artest is a good player if coach rick adelman can control the team well
3840335 because were getting rid of rookies this year and next year and were getting an experienced player thats a team that needs to win right now not in the future
3840336 i think this team has no problem being a good team in the regular season how good can we be depends on how we show up in the playoffs its very clear the playoffs we already know are a different game its playing fundamentally thats how utah gets success two years in a row against us i think for some reason ron is that kind of person he plays very fundamentally body up physical defensively offensively
3840337 you know yao brings a lot to the table and if we can get him to stay healthy or play any defense this could potentially work out theres obviously worries with yao since hes such a soft player but im confident that coach adelman can make it work
3840338 we are trying to ascertain whether its a suicide blast or not

3840412 weve had a few false starts and ive had to run a couple of laps no big deal
3840413 no one wants to see that you want it to run like it should and i think for the most part weve done that now they havent thrown everything at me but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3840414 there has not been a tremendous amount of demand for that from our customers
3840415 i think you could be a model i want to take pictures of you

3840483 these projects further our commitment to incorporate sustainability into all aspects of our operations we will closely monitor the results to determine how we can best leverage these innovative methods to increase our participation in renewable energy projects while also benefiting our business
3840484 we are proud of what we are accomplishing as an organization to reduce energy consumption and extend jcpenneys legacy of social responsibility and our associates remain focused on seeking new ways to protect the environment
3840485 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
3840486 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

3840488 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
3840489 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
3840490 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
3840491 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
3840492 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
3840493 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
3840494 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
3840495 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
3840496 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
3840497 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
3840498 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
3840499 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
3840500 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
3840501 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
3840502 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

3840550 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3840551 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3840552 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3840553 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3840554 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3840555 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3840556 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3840557 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3840558 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3840559 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3840560 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3840561 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3840562 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3840563 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3840564 they dont him the best color man in the business for nothing

3840567 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
3840568 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
3840569 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
3840570 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
3840571 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get them to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work

3840592 i am laughing because i just now remembered that butts exist
3840593 it was a long wait for one race and the conditions were very light
3840594 in those conditions anything could have happened so im pretty relieved to have come away with a good result
3840595 i was really fortunate to get seventh in that race i was sixth of seventh at the first windward mark and just had a disastrous downwind at the bottom mark i was 15 or something like that it all went wrong
3840596 i just had to calm myself down on the second upwind and went out to the right of the fleet and i got some wind pressure and was able to get back i had to do something to get back into the race
3840597 there are three more races probably and the medal race which counts double so i have to keep trying hard
3840598 we were prepared to sit around a lot here it was just all part of the plan
3840599 we tried to stay cool and then really focused in when the time came
3840600 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3840601 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3840602 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3840603 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3840604 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3840605 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3840606 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3840607 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3840608 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3840609 i was more or less sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take for 50 and i was hoping that i would be dead on
3840610 it was a best time but i was just disappointed
3840611 its always difficult to compete against each other and was especially so with an olympics spot on the line
3840612 weve gotten used to since weve been doing it for the last six years but its never fun to win at the expense of a family member
3840613 we just went to the range for fun and did it alongside him
3840614 as we were practicing one day he said it would be fun to go to a match and we ended up placing very well for our first time and it progressed from there we all enjoyed the competition
3840615 we can get pretty competitive but its fun it helps us stay focused
3840616 how many people get world class athletes to train with every day i think im pretty lucky
3840617 a counselor asked me why i wasnt writing anything and i told him and he said if thats you dream put down then work hard and it can happen
3840618 i walked in the opening ceremony and there are now rods to describe it you dream about it and when its there its almost surreal its truly amazing
3840619 it takes a lot more effort a lot of strength and a little bit of stubbornness from her to hold the gun

3840813 if you take a book with you on a journey an odd thing happens the book begins collecting your memories and forever after you have only to open that book to be back where you first read it it will all come into your mind with the very first words the sights you saw in that place what it smelled like the ice cream you ate while you were reading it yes books are like flypaper memories cling to the printed page better than anything else
3840814 we are honored to welcome eli harari a pioneering leader in both technology and business as a keynote speaker at flash memory summit 2008
3840815 under elis leadership sandisk has grown into a major international retail brand with more than 860 u s and 550 international patents as flash technology proliferates across applications ranging from consumer devices to spacecraft we believe that sandisk will continue to make tremendous contributions to the advancement of flash memory and the ways in which it impacts our lives

3840817 iphone 2 0 is ready for the enterprise but caveats apply
3840818 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and browsing
3840819 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3840820 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3840821 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3840822 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3840823 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3840824 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3840825 accept the lowered overall security footprint that adoption will dictate or block the device from use
3840826 which could be an issue if the it organization hasnt verified what apple has delivered
3840827 we strongly suggest that enterprises use existing management tools to modify the itunes registry entries to disable firmware updates file transfers and other activities that could inject unwanted content into the enterprise as well as to lock down the registry
3840828 eliminate itunes as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device as microsoft and rim have done
3840829 although we cannot confirm what is causing the battery life to be so short we believe it to be apples implementation of exchange activesync and or wi fi
3840830 apple has delivered an iphone that is acceptable for business use at the appliance level most prospective iphone users will judge the device based on consumer appeal the app store applications and the iphones excellent browser are supplemented with an e mail client which provides acceptable business capability with excellence in some areas
3840831 hay que devolverle la autoridad a los docentes trabajar junto a ellos para que los adolescentes vean claramente qu es lo que est bien y qu es lo que est mal

3840840 the price boom of the last five years may well have passed into history but so far the effect of its demise is to slow the number of transactions rather than cause a drop in prices the scottish housing market is demonstrating its traditional resilience in the face of an economic downturn
3840841 the number looks disturbingly bullish but well probably see some rebound in gasoline supplies next week now that refineries are back online after the storm
3840842 weve got a good sized really going here today but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3840843 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3840844 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3840845 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3840846 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3840847 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3840848 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3840849 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3840850 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3840851 recent reports have indicated that economic growth outside of the housing market remains robust with a healthy consumer sector and improving business spending

3840855 i kept telling him you dont want to do this
3840856 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
3840857 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3840858 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3840859 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3840860 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
3840861 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
3840862 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3840863 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think lee harvey oswald is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a conspiracy theory
3840864 ive seen the theories that he was a pawn like lee harvey oswald thats going to be hard to disprove
3840865 how do you disprove that a dead man was not a puppet being manipulated by the cia youre talking about proving a negative you cant prove aliens didnt mail the letters
3840866 to rally a free world in defence of a free georgia
3840867 the us stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists the territorial sovereignty of georgia be respected
3840868 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3840869 yesterday i heard senator mccain say we are all georgians now
3840870 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but okay its time to pass from this from words to deeds

3840878 there is now far too much on the table particularly for developing countries to give up on these negotiations
3840879 this is trying to rewrite history this serves as the benchmark to resume negotiations

3840883 you can have her shipped home for 5 000 or you can bury her here in the holy land for 150
3840884 why would you spend 5 000 to ship your wife home when it would be wonderful to be buried here and you would spend only 150
3840885 long ago a man died here was buried here and three days later he rose from the dead i just cant take that chance

3840888 morgans 25th century earth is convincing while the questions he poses about how much self is tied to body chemistry and how the rich believe themselves above the law are especially timely
3840889 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3840890 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3840891 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there
3840892 terrible 6 efficiency even an old 80c51 can do at least 3x
3840893 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3840894 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3840895 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3840896 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3840897 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3840898 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund
3840899 hey rick we think your low fee and very low touch service model is a disservice to investors we would like to ask you to increase the support you offer your clients
3840900 shes been such a good dog i knew that if she was there she was doing her best to take care of jake
3840901 it was a relief to know that theres an end and that we still have a part of jake
3840902 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3840903 we need to put some weight on her shes a big dog and looks too skinny
3840904 increasing temperature and increasing carbon dioxide the result of global warming increase the ragweed pollen production up to two to four times than its normal production the previous years
3840905 ragweed allergy will be more severe and last longer this year
3840906 im seeing patients that never have allergy before even in their 60s 70s or 80s or young children became sensitized directly to ragweed pollen
3840907 if you are a patient and have allergy problems and suffering if you check the pollen count and its very high then you need to plan ahead
3840908 you should not be outside more than eight hours without taking your allergy medication

3840911 when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3840912 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3840913 so the fact that the cost of borrowing money has dropped over the last 10 days has had limited impact
3840914 basically we have a situation where all of the term deposits are rolling over at the moment at a higher rate of around 150 200 basis points and all of the long term funding we are rolling over at a higher rate
3840915 the good news is that in a pinch the rba has a big 7 25 percentage points to work with
3840916 in times like these the challenge is to present a product that represents good value and a good home entertainment solution and i think we have been substantially effective in doing that
3840917 in the course of the second six months of the year we actually got churn down from what wed had in the first six months of the year so i think our settings are pretty good and our growth has continued to be solid
3840918 shit nee dit moet ik niet doen als deze bak leeg is voel ik me straks eenzaam en dik dat wil ik niet

3840924 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3840925 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3840926 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3840927 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3840928 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3840929 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3840930 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3840931 americans respect your courageous choice for liberty and as you build a free and democratic georgia the american people will stand with you
3840932 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russia actions that are inconsistent with these statements

3840934 ho appreso ha spiegato morzenti che il presidente del comitato organizzatore della val badia marcello varallo ha scritto una lettera ai componenti del proprio comitato annunciando che per contrasti economici con la fisi non sar pi possibile organizzare in occasione della competizione il consueto gal e il tendone di ospitalit
3840935 il problema semplice ha aggiunto morzenti ed che ormai come fisi abbiamo raggiunto accordi con tutte le principali localit organizzatrici di gare di coppa del mondo da cortina a sestriere da thuille a bormio per una pi equa ripartizione a favore della fisi delle entrate entrate agli interessi televisivi solo con gardena e badia non ancora stato trovato un accordo sembrano pi interessate ai soldi che alle gare
3840936 possibile che a fine mese quando si riunir il comitato fis per programmare le competizioni a partire dalla stagione 2009 2010 litalia non proponga pi gardena e badia

3840944 we take it for granted that a vote means a secret ballot but it was not always that way
3840945 with labor unions being major supporters of the democratic party spending hundreds of millions of dollars in this years election campaign it is hardly surprising that congressional democrats have lined up solidly behind legislation to let union organizers simply collect signed cards from a majority of workers in order to be certified as the officially recognized union for those workers

3840958 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence

3840965 after you see who the businesses are we found that the majority of consumers want to interact with those businesses by going to the website or calling them
3840966 but the ones still in research mode arent ready to select a business and are looking for a way to connect that is a little bit more on their terms they can fill out the lead form and fill out what their requirements are

3840983 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by

3840993 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3840994 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3840995 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3840996 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3840997 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3840998 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live

3841035 yup tim team mccain is just not giving themselves the opportunity to cover much the greater part of the playing field of the north nj and south nj is left wide open
3841036 thanks tim i can always count on you to laugh at my bad jokes now with team obama new jersey a completely different story they have strong coverage on all fronts north south and central
3841037 they have offices in west jersey boom in camden boom again and in edison boom times three now that is coverage
3841038 you got that right a ratio of one office for every 3 million people and for team mccain a lousy ratio one office for every 18 million people thats gotta hurt their team tim
3841039 enough on geography now lets go to the issues team obama is in the lead there too healthcare the economy especially the war in iraq team obama is all over team mccain pouncing everywhere
3841040 you got that right new jersey has spent more than 25 billion itself on this war and people are tired of this that could pay for 2 751 979 people with health care for one full year or 398 195 teachers for the same one year or get this 119 131 affordable housing units thats a lot of scratch
3841041 that could save dollars in property taxes team obama has the strategy in the game there team mccains plan they want to stay in iraq for 100 years
3841042 yup again kent and now to the people numbers team obama leads in most areas team obama gets the support of 94 of black voters and has a 15 point lead among women is ahead among men narrowly 48 45 and leads among independents 45 42 but team mccain leads among white voters 50 42
3841043 but thats not as bad as the last place team bush nj who is lounging in the basement at a 26 approval rating
3841044 so overall in new jersey team obama still leads by 10 points over team mccain
3841045 we have not announced or revealed any hard drive this is nothing but rumour and speculation

3841047 the willingness to bear with discomforts is really one of the distinguishing features of this convention
3841048 today the capacity of the lumber camp near the exhibition building where pork and beans are cooked in true northwestern lumbermans style has been severely tested hundreds of people who paid to enter the camp today and then paid for dishes of pork and beans came to the conclusion that worse food was easier to get than this minneapolis people think that they have kept their pledges to the national committee if the thousands now here are not obligated to go hungry they did not contract to feed everybody in fifth avenue hotel style
3841049 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game

3841057 well we dont want a student organization on the level of a national office
3841058 all the shit we said last year was just fucked up its not how things fundamentally work
3841059 listen we dont need partisanship on that level we need partisanship on the level of on issues of the war on issues of the environment on issues of worker organizing
3841060 does a white puerto rican person face national oppression in the united states
3841061 elections are fucked up and were going to do our own thing and youre just being fooled
3841062 well be on the streets protesting mccains imperialism and then well show the contradictions to the obama supporters with their candidate
3841063 what kind of relationship can we have with bourgeois electoral politics
3841064 yes this is an issue facing students and we have to do something about it nationally

3841074 international visitors know almost nothing theyre lucky if they understand the term maori and know what it means
3841075 new zealanders are generally less interested than internationals in maori experiences although a small number are very interested some new zealanders were very nervous about what they didnt know but feel they should know more so they feel embarrassed to go to these things
3841076 will visitors pay more for maori products not at this stage

3841084 continued failure by u s tax policymakers to keep up with our top global economic competitors means that were solidifying a trend that will result in our children and grandchildren not seeing the economic growth weve seen in our lifetimes
3841085 theres a real wallet impact for americans as we continue to sit idly by while other countries improve the way they do business and we should be very concerned about jobs capital and investments moving from high tax countries to low tax countries

3841087 we found that some gifted and talented students are not engaged in learning because they dont see school as being relevant to them
3841088 theyre thinking laterally and they think quickly theyre creative with their ideas and they are creative thinkers as well
3841089 their mind is going a thousand miles an hour and its just not being challenged

3841101 ci piace ma bisogna rispettare alcuni parametri societari nel fare degli acquisti
3841102 posso dir loro che ci presenteremo nelle migliori condizioni possibili allinizio della stagione e che siamo la stessa squadra dello scorso anno con il valore aggiunto di aquilani che nella passata stagione ha giocato poco
3841103 rispetto tutti i miei colleghi dai quali spesso imparo molte cose sono sicuro che sar cos anche con mourinho
3841104 ci sono varie squadre che possono fare bene ringrazio lippi per i complimenti che ci ha fatto per essere al pari dellinter forse ci vorrebbe lui come allenatore
3841105 i grandi calciatori sanno inserirsi subito in un gruppo e comunque non detto che chi arrivi sia migliore di chi gi nella rosa
3841106 great job with the conference completely professional and completely fascinating
3841107 thank you for a fantastic conference great people exciting new technology and an excellent view of where we are and where we are going in this space i appreciated being a part of it and look forward to next years event
3841108 i really didnt know what to expect with this conference but i knew that it represented something important i believe this conference will be seen as one of the compelling and catalyzing events of 2006 as well as the one that introduced the new office 2 0 market category congratulations and thanks
3841109 the inaugural office 2 0 conference successfully brought together the people products and ideas forming around the next major phase of computing
3841110 office 2 0 was one of the best conferences ive ever attended in my 20 years experience in the high tech industry why because there was a special magic in the air that we were all on the ground floor of something big even the skeptics who made for some interesting panel discord couldnt deny there was something going on here that was worth sticking around for for the record i am an unabashed believer
3841111 it feels good to underestimate somebody or some group or an event with the millstone of office 2 0 branding but ismaels centered confidence in what he has discovered both in terms of focus and community has birthed a formidable model that sits comfortably along the conference unconference fault line with few of the defects of either extreme
3841112 great gathering the quality to the audience reminded me of the first javaone event as the governator says ill be back
3841113 during the two day event i was struck by the tremendous focus on my favorite subject the end user experience the high quality user experience touched everything from the innovative use of the user friendly ipod as the giveaway pre loaded with the agenda to the use of imacs as demo pods to the group demonstration sessions to the vendors in the demo pods everything spoke breathed and smelled of rich high quality end user experience
3841114 the office 2 0 conference has set a new standard in high tech conferences
3841115 great conference easily the best most rewarding one ive been to this year
3841116 im about to leave san francisco following the office 2 0 conference and thought id share a few of the highlights and some reflection on what transpired over the past couple of days for the most part i would declare this inaugural event a great success due in no small part to the tireless efforts of ismael ghalimi of it redux and the very energetic team he assembled for the event
3841117 great conference we look forward to participating in the next one
3841118 high quality venue high quality content it was great to see innovation aimed at solving real business problems the smaller size of the conference made for a more intimate experience enhanced by engaged experts with a shared passion
3841119 extremely interesting conference well organized and leaving me with lots to think about
3841120 everyone out there looking for a way to attract and keep the press mimic the office 2 0 conference the press loves free food all day long the press loves free ipods the press loves free laptops press kits and when you give these sorts of things to the press they are far more likely to feel that inborn guilt welling up hell it may even drive them to check out the booths in the halls
3841121 it truely was a well organized conference and ive seen my share
3841122 i should say that the office 2 0 conference turned out to be a great event at which to announce our plans we met a ton of great people who not only were interested in joining the community or tapping its knowledge but also had a number of great discussions with people who had ideas for future plans for the service as well
3841123 before this week i considered myself to be fairly well read and well connected in the web 2 0 for business scene but the office 2 0 conference made me realize how limited my view has actually been it was a very valuable and enjoyable event for me personally
3841124 i was very impressed with the conference organizer ismael galimi who whipped together this conference after evangelizing the concept in his blog earlier in the year his philosophy expounded on his blog about the move from desktop installed software to hosted web applications spurred much debate before and during the conference it was pretty impressive that he and his team were able to assemble such a strong line of speakers and vendors in such a short period of time
3841125 terrific event one of the best ive attended on exploring the application of web 2 0 ideas to business
3841126 i found the conference to be amazing and riveting the people i met in the hallway were as diverse as interesting and as insightful as the panels the range of problems identified and solutions proposed was incredible the intermingling of clients like me solution providers like iupload and teqlo vcs and of course the enterprise irregulars was amazing where else do you get a chance to deal with that range of people thinking about the next generation in office productivity tools and enterprise solutions
3841127 thank you for a great show it was great to see and hear and contribute amongst so many visionary voices we look for ward to next year
3841128 using an ipod nano to deliver content related to the event and replace a shwag bag stuffed with paper and disposable trinkets was a great idea and a big hit with the attendees it was a perfect example of the sense of design and style ismael brought ot the event another nice touch a rigid plastic badge holder strung on a clear plastic cord that refused to spin around and threaten asphyxiation
3841129 the office 2 0 conference that was held this week was exciting for me aside from the fact that i came out of the shadows with my new company teqlo there was a sense of determination and intent about the office 2 0 meme that extends beyond hype there are real companies with real and substantial products working here
3841130 i feel like i learned more in two days at the show than i have all year not just about office 2 0 but about questioning assumptions
3841131 the office 2 0 conference provided an outstanding forum for the key players in todays office revolution to exchange ideas and push boundaries of what our industry can achieve i look forward to our joining together again next year to see what solutions have been born out of these two outstanding days in october and how they get adopted by the end user community
3841132 at the office 2 0 conference enthusiasm was in abundance having seen several other it revolutions in the past i sense that this is another that cannot be ignored
3841133 office 2 0 was a great conference all around how often do you get the opportunity to connect with a group of like minded people at the earliest stages of inventing a new way of working online better yet this was a chance to start working with a passionate community to realize the office 2 0 vision im looking forward to the next event with more customers on stage and seeing all of online office apps working together to serve the needs of end users
3841134 great conference great to see the office 2 0 concept gaining the acceptance it deserves business software regains it long lost creativity
3841135 the office 2 0 conference was fantastic for itensil and the seminal event for the whole enterprise 2 0 ecosystem it exceeded our wildest expectations for meeting key customers partners media and investors

3841137 all these areas we controlled since 2003 but now they are coming and attacking and now they are in the control of the government
3841138 they are readying to move to other places the government is cheating us and cheating the international community they are going to destroy all the places to control them
3841139 government soldiers are shooting randomly in the area civilians have been killed and are missing some have fled
3841140 government forces and arab militia are moving north the government is conducting the second round of ethnic cleansing in northern darfur i call on the international community to stop the killing of civilians
3841141 the movement is still in pursuit of enemy forces at various locations
3841142 we are going to make a joint evaluation of the political situation and how we are going to fight for our legitimate economic resources
3841143 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3841144 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3841145 it appears that a suicide bomber blew himself up next to the police in a very crowded area we have five people killed and seven injured at the moment
3841146 it appears the motorcycle rider blasted them his body was making burning noises
3841147 i saw at least three policemen lying on the ground unconscious or dead there were three to four other policemen standing nearby with their uniforms torn

3841156 no one has much sympathy for these banks that made subprime loans
3841157 and in some cities like cleveland judges arent letting them sit on the properties theyre ordering them to tear them down or sell them
3841158 it doesnt make sense in some neighborhoods to keep paying costs and costs
3841159 it can make more financial sense to give it away

3841163 they want to come in where theres an opportunity to invest some capital and take an ownership position but leave the operations in the hands of management
3841164 the economics on the expansions could look pretty attractive in terms of the payback and rate of returns
3841165 the problem is usually those big internationals want to operate as well in this case i would be very surprised if harvest gave up operatorship of the refinery
3841166 its actually cheaper to ship it than it is to pipeline it from the refining area down in the gulf of mexico
3841167 there actually is a geographic advantage to where theyre at right now
3841168 having that flexibility helps them when gasoline margins are so weak in north america they can actually ship that away
3841169 in our view financing such a significant expansion could prove to be a major challenge harvest already boasts the most levered balance sheet in the sector and is not likely to retire any debt going forward as the entirety of its cash flow will be required for capital spending and distributions
3841170 economic analyses indicate the projected return on investment and other financial metrics are compelling
3841171 my opinion is that if you really look out for good deals you can combat this unlike the price of gas
3841172 i was able to get all my cereal for free

3841194 the partnership will deliver products that strengthen the new version of groupwise and allow gwava netcleanse technologies and vircom to collaborate in order to explore more joint opportunities
3841195 our teaming with netcleanse and vircom enhances gwavas leadership in the groupwise community as well
3841196 expanding our existing partnership with gwava to include vircom makes perfect sense for netcleanse
3841197 we expect to derive great dividends from the addition of a strong technology partner like vircom
3841198 partnering with gwava and netcleanse not only benefits our customers with better solutions and more control it also lets us strengthen our position in the spam control software space

3841201 this transaction will not affect our employees or the service we provide to more than 7 million texas consumers our dedicated employees will continue to provide superior reliability while deploying one of the most advanced utility technology platforms in the country
3841202 the upgrade is a strong vote of confidence by an independent voice of the structure that was put in place to ring fence oncor from the obligations of efh and its subsidiaries
3841203 oncor plans to invest billions of dollars in the infrastructure needs of texas over the next several years and these measures only serve to strengthen our ability to do so
3841204 pennsylvanias families and businesses are facing high energy costs now and by january 2011 when the remaining electricity rate caps come off statewide electricity rates will rise which is not surprising after 14 years of capped rates
3841205 electricity prices in pennsylvania have been capped since 1996 and electricity has not increased in constant or inflation adjusted dollars unlike gasoline home heating oil natural gas and other energy products
3841206 reducing demand for energy and for electricity through conservation is the surest quickest way to reduce energy prices and electricity bills
3841207 reduced demand for oil not drilling is the major reason why the price for oil has fallen from 147 to 113 per barrel in the last month hb 2200 the energy savings bill must pass right away if the electricity conservation programs will be in place when the remaining electricity rate caps are removed in the next 16 to 28 months
3841208 i pledge that i will lead the fight to pass a robust energy savings policy without delay specifically house bill 2200 and i further pledge to have that legislation to the governors desk before the november 2008 election
3841209 i further promise that i will not let the citizens of pennsylvania be held hostage by legislative inertia at a time when each and every family and business is suffering from out of control energy bills with no end in sight hb 2200 provides important relief from high electricity costs that our citizens need and passing it will be my solemn duty during this legislative session
3841210 we must give our families and businesses the help they need without delay
3841211 even with more than 400 industry professionals registered for the webinar we continue to receive requests to make the presentation available
3841212 the purpose of our webinar is to emphasize that the fusion of thermoplastic pipe is a critical process that demands an open and full analysis by contractors utilities engineers and pipe manufacturers alike
3841213 for nearly sixty years the ppi has and will continue to engage the standards community in creating transparent criteria and test methods that provide the specifier and end user with the most up to date technical information available we believe the presence of these industry standards provides assurance that the technology and process for fusing plastic pipe are proven and reliable
3841214 too many times end users make the assumption that all plastics are alike and we are concerned that failures in one type of plastic can affect the reputation of other plastics
3841215 the primary feature that differentiates the morpho rapid 1100 is its all in one design
3841216 this smaller lighter unit is fully functional as a stand alone device holding its own watch list without being physically connected to any other terminal or computer this technology streamlines law enforcement and border control activity that requires near real time identification of suspects on site where they have been apprehended
3841217 we have re engineered the morpho rapid 1100 based on direct input from public safety officers who use this technology in the field every day
3841218 as a result the rapid 1100 now offers more robust wireless communication options for faster and more reliable data transmission

3841464 as the states population grows and use of outdoor recreational areas increases we must be sure were doing everything we can to protect all users
3841465 we do not condone or accept the actions taken by this person and feel that we as a community must take a stand against such blatant disregard for safety of those we share the woods with
3841466 is everyone in this city so mean i just got robbed a homeless guy asked me for some money to eat and i opened up my wallet and he grabbed it and took off i had 300 in my wallet and now i have nothing
3841467 maam im not trying to get money im not a bad person im so hungry but im not a bum im not trying to beg for money

3841474 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3841475 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3841476 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3841477 but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3841478 although the failures are only seen in small percentages of all the chips weve shipped with this material set the repair cost of a notebook can be expensive
3841479 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3841480 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3841481 but the states leaders have failed to act therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3841482 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3841483 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3841484 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3841485 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3841486 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3841487 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3841488 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3841489 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3841490 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3841491 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3841492 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3841493 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3841494 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3841495 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3841496 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3841497 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3841498 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3841499 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them

3841521 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3841522 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3841523 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3841524 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3841525 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3841526 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3841527 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3841528 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3841529 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3841530 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3841531 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3841532 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3841533 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3841534 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3841535 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3841536 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3841537 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3841538 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3841539 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3841540 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3841541 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3841542 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3841543 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3841544 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3841545 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3841546 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3841547 the streets are full of people and wrecked vehicles and you get a lot of dead eyed stares there was no soccer with kids or anything our job was to kill the taliban we were there to fight it was other guys who came in behind us who sat down for tea with village elders

3841567 taking advantage of the negotiations to free the bay of pigs prisoners the cia tried to use a key person in the talks american lawyer james b
3841568 the revelation is one of many anecdotes in after the bay of pigs a book on the negotiations held between the committee of relatives for the liberation of prisoners and havana from april to december 1962
3841569 the 238 page book published late last year was written by cuban exile pablo p rez cisneros with businessman john b donovan son of the late negotiator and jeff koenreich a veteran member of the red cross who has promoted humanitarian missions between the united states and cuba
3841570 p rez cisneros is the son of berta barreto de los heros who was coordinator in cuba of the families committee and interceded with castro to trade off the 1 113 prisoners from the failed april 1961 invasion
3841571 barreto de los heros started the book but died in march of 1993 her son who spent eight years researching and finishing the book was the person who bought the wetsuit and scuba gear at the end of 1962 not knowing that both were destined for castro
3841572 two months later donovan made the first of 11 trips to havana for mediation with the cuban government
3841573 when donovan returns to cuba in october 1962 castro tells him he wants to have an aqualung scuba gear and wetsuit for diving
3841574 so donovan tells me he wants to get quality equipment for a person but without telling me they are for castro
3841575 p rez cisneros who had been a champion underwater spearfisherman in cuba bought a 130 wetsuit and scuba equipment for 215 in a well known store in times square new york
3841576 castro received them in november 1962 and some weeks later on another one of donovans trips the cuban president told the lawyer that he had used them
3841577 only months after the negotiations had concluded did p rez cisneros learn all the details about the real story
3841578 during world war ii james donovan had worked for the office of strategic services which preceded the cia
3841579 when donovan informed the cia that castro had requested diving equipment the u s agency said it would take care of it but the lawyer rejected any involvement in the proposal to contaminate the wetsuit and scuba equipment and preferred to give castro the equipment bought in times square
3841580 in may of 1963 castro invited donovan and lawyer john e nolan who represented then justice secretary robert kennedy to a day of diving in the bay of pigs area and again used the u s equipment
3841581 the book sprinkled with curious and unexpected events is a tense story of how love determination and cleverness made possible the exchange of the brigade 2506 prisoners for 53 million in food medicine and medical equipment
3841582 the efforts of donovan and the families committee came at a moment of uncertainty over the prisoners fates
3841583 the committees first meeting with castro took place in barreto de los heros house in miramar on april 10 1962 four days later 60 wounded brigade members were flown to miami
3841584 knowing that barreto de los heros telephone was tapped donovan arranged a secret code for communications
3841585 in mid december castro agreed to an exchange and handed over a 29 page list of food and medicine that was to be sent to cuba by the american red cross
3841586 on dec 23 1962 the first five planes left for miami carrying 484 members of the brigade a day later the 719 prisoners that remained flew in nine more flights
3841587 i was often accused of being an indifferent student and given some of my grades i can appreciate the charity in that remark but i was not so much indifferent as selective i liked english and history and i usually did well in those classes i was less interested and less successful in math and science
3841588 a few months prior to graduation i had taken the naval academy entrance exams did surprisingly well even on the math exam
3841589 my reputation as a rowdy and impetuous young man was not im embarrassed to confess confined to academy circles many upstanding residents of lovely annapolis witnesses to some of our more extravagant acts of insubordination disapproved of me as did many academy officials
3841590 at the smallest provocation i would go off in a mad frenzy and then suddenly crash to the floor unconscious
3841591 the doctor prescribed a treatment that seems a little severe by modern standards of child care he instructed my parents to fill a bathtub with cold water whenever i commenced a tantrum and when i appeared to be holding my breath to drop me fully clothed into it

3841600 the draws are bullish across the board lower refinery output and lower imports led to the draws in the products for the past week
3841601 i think concerns over the georgian situation raised by president george w bush technical buy stops and the stock draws on oil and products are combining to push crude futures higher
3841602 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3841603 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3841604 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
3841605 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
3841606 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
3841607 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
3841608 for urgent cases at the top of the list information is sent back and forth by email or fax

3841612 im very happy to come back to the race of champions as its an event that i really enjoy
3841613 it will be very nice to compete against michael again like in 2004 we live very close to each other but rarely have a chance to meet
3841614 last time we actually met was on a track racing motorcycles michael was a little bit faster than me but i hope to get my revenge in identical cars at the race of champions
3841615 we kind of respected it because the process hadnt been moving
3841616 we have instructions from gen oviedo to collaborate as much as possible with lugo because this is the only way to lift this country out of poverty
3841617 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
3841618 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3841619 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3841620 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3841621 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3841622 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3841623 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3841624 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem

3841641 increasing temperature and increasing carbon dioxide the result of global warming increase the ragweed pollen production up to two to four times than its normal production the previous years
3841642 ragweed allergy will be more severe and last longer this year
3841643 im seeing patients that never have allergy before even in their 60s 70s or 80s or young children became sensitized directly to ragweed pollen
3841644 if you are a patient and have allergy problems and suffering if you check the pollen count and its very high then you need to plan ahead
3841645 you should not be outside more than eight hours without taking your allergy medication
3841646 that leads in my case and i would think in other cases as well that people say well lets just not reinsulate the roof

3841658 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3841659 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
3841660 im sure he can afford a ticket if he wants to be here it would have been have nice for him to be here and witness it i really feel he contributed a lot to swimming but its time to turn the reigns over to somebody else youve got to move on with life get a life after swimming

3841686 i need a new set of boots after that we should see about getting some clockwork parts how many do you think the ship can hold
3841687 we can safely stash a few hundred before we run out of good hiding spots if we pick up some cover material we can start filling in the hull as well

3841691 they say that you have to wear a filter mask in the morning if you are traveling for more than a few minutes through the bowels of this place
3841692 i dont doubt by the ever bitter teats of arkuros are those narlyocrian soldiers
3841693 what in the world is a squad of narlyos doing in ecidia much less walking around in edora without a company of homeland guardians escorting them
3841694 theyve assured us that they will not interfere if it reaches them
3841695 wherever they are going isnt here thats all we should be concerned with they are terrifying enough in the narl
3841696 nah theyre not going to do anything here they wont use their particular brand of finger wiggling and curse muttering in a place where they can shield themselves behind their own laws
3841697 tell me little one why did your master send you to us
3841698 master informs me that i am underproductive and slow to respond
3841699 see here sherry two gears on her inner core are misaligned one spins but it only catches every third or fourth tooth it must have been a poor fit when she was made and over time it has grown worse and worse
3841700 shes got a malfunctioning power supply as well could you bring me a nexus as well
3841701 wont that damage her memories and behaviors if we swap it out
3841702 only if we take too long replacing it the one she has is ramping up too quickly causing excessive wear on her joints shell be completely bust in another year if this continues
3841703 master informs me that i am next to useless and he wishes he had his old model back i am unable to appease him on this
3841704 your master will get many years out of you yet he just should have had you looked at immediately instead of waiting so long now tell me if this hurts you
3841705 you know that isnt correct you feel discomfort and pain so that you know you are being damaged you do not feel the need or desire to vocalize it however what i want to know is if this makes you feel better or worse little one
3841706 well have you walking around once we replace that damaged power supply you can tell us then how you feel
3841707 now we will swap this out in a moment but when we do you fill experience a distinct sensation do your best to not thrash about when it happens but it is only natural for your body to react unpleasantly
3841708 in essence you will be dead for about five minutes but then you will return you should experience no further ill effects beyond a mild start up jolt which may cause you to cycle through a few imbedded memories and commands your motors will be disabled until we confirm youre operational again however
3841709 proceed master would like me back by dinner or he fears he will starve if no one is around to cook for him
3841710 okay remove that tainted supply and place it over on the bench for examination ill install the new one and power her up again
3841711 you referred to it as a her it is an it
3841712 it looks like a small girl it is only natural to occasionally refer to them as what they appear to be
3841713 its overheating if you observe it long enough youll see it discharging slightly so something is rather wrong with it set it down over there and help me attach all cables to this new one
3841714 we have two minutes and forty seconds before memory death occurs
3841715 plenty of time make sure to attach the rear cables my old hands have trouble getting those on tight these days
3841716 master over the windows rainbows dozens for tea always problems these days more paper sir
3841717 yes we turned those off prior to removing your old power supply
3841718 im restoring power to your motors could you please give a diagnostic of what remains to be worked on
3841719 your master must have you doing a lot of work cleaning
3841720 i can tell from the joint wear you will require a servicing in three months for a few of these but there is nothing pressing at this point we can replace a few of your coils and gearings for general performance improvements
3841721 master wants any and all service work done as soon as possible
3841722 well we are at isagul if they let us go we can just carry on as we were planning to before
3841723 no need for that i didnt choose to make myself known until youd taken to talking to one another now this plan give me some details
3841724 were heading into the northlands obviously we are wanted men here if we can get past the gates we have a straight march towards gallaron we can be in relative safety after only a few days once we cross through the gates no one in their right mind would chase us up there not even the beast in the shard
3841725 i thought i recognized you i watched you two search the speakers room youre quite well read if you could recognize a star shard at a glance you didnt even try to touch it out of curiosity
3841726 thank you id read about them in a book from the library at cotinari
3841727 ive checked your bags over one bag was full of supplies and clothing the other was stuffed full of books but very specific books old tomes things that were supposed to have been purged from the libraries when the church rose to power youve even got yourself a few first editions in there for a mundane youre incredibly well stocked in arcane tomes your collection rivals mine and im a dedicated collector
3841728 reading is a bit of a hobby of mine i wasnt aware they were valuable books just that they were old and curious
3841729 how do you plan on getting past the gate the guards on this side arent just going to let you pass and the guards on the other side ive chatted with them a few times they arent necessarily the most sane of folk
3841730 there is a lesser gate well a walkway more like on the northern edge of the wall if we walk to the oceans edge there is a small entrance into the northlands there its hardly guarded three guards tops we were going to kill our way through it if we had to but if youre coming with us then we might just have another option
3841731 you said plenty you wouldnt be curious about where we were going unless you were coming with us or we were going with you youre not leaving with these mages most of them seem to regard you slightly less than they regard us and the majority of them still believe that muro and myself are responsible for killing quite a few of their friends
3841732 they are putting you two into my custody as soon as my apprentice is able to move on her own we are leaving here do not make me regret my decision to not turn you over to them i may not look like much but i assure you the fate the two zealots shared is just a sample of what i can and will do
3841733 i was training to be a priestess i knew i had something in me that would let me treat the sick mend the wounded and comfort those with loss a priestess i tried so hard but something was wrong with me i tried to hide it for so long but it kept growing and getting worse
3841734 i never had the talent for healing my talents lay in the infliction of pain i hurt people i never wanted to hurt people but my touch could send spider webs of pain over someones skin my breath could blister and my will could hurt everyone around me
3841735 i can only hurt people when im happy helping people would make me happy and then i would hurt them and i would feel sad i would help them again and feel happy it was a roller coaster i wanted to die i wanted to be something i couldnt i was an abomination i was evil despite how much i tried not to be i couldnt control my power then
3841736 they found me the inquisition at first they wanted to burn me alive for being a warlock a witch but one of their superiors heard of my power and told me that i had been blessed with a terrible gift i should use that gift for the good of all instead of trying to hide it so they started to train me
3841737 they gave me drugs to make me feel good then they had me practice my talents then they would give me more drugs drugs to bring me up drugs to even me out to help me cope with my powers and what they needed me to do
3841738 i was an examiner for the inquisition thats a nice word for sadist and torturer they would get me soaring high and then send me in with a list of questions as long as i had answers when i was done i could do whatever i wanted if they liked what i found they gave me just enough to keep me glowing until next time if they didnt get what they wanted i got nothing they had to be careful as if they gave me too much id probably hurt them a lot more than they would ever want me too i never learned how to control the flow when i wasnt working but when i was asking questions i was an artist a master at what i did they trained me well
3841739 torine makes you feel like a small child getting a great big present you are on top of the world and you stay on top as long as you keep taking torine they started putting it in my water as i struggled through my training and before you know it they had me perfectly conditioned they bombarded me over and over with their dogma their methods their well their everything all while keeping me high on torine they would bring me down with viartes root just enough to even me out after a while you start to associate all the good things in life with the inquisitions point of view torine has the bonus side effect of removing your guilt viarte also suppresses it so that you can deal with whatever you did while you were high
3841740 they had me examine three hundred and seventy two individuals personally be present for the examinations of four hundred and ninety seven and capture another hundred and fifteen personally
3841741 seventeen hundred men women and children have died because of the use of my powers at the command of the inquisition some of them where warlocks or evil mages or priests most though most where just normal people caught up in the whole mess once we finished with them we couldnt let them leave theyd get me really high and let me finish them off the torine would tell me that i loved it when it wore off i would be a wreck though i started taking viarte when i woke up after my first year im on viarte constantly now they tried to break my addiction to it after my second year of service but i kept trying to kill myself so they just kept me on it as long as they could give me enough torine to let me do my job they didnt care they had plenty of torine they only had one of me
3841742 you had several clashes with the brotherhood of mages did you not
3841743 that was the organization i was charged with taking down well to take down their members at least they would give me a name and a sketch and i would head into town and ask around if i found information i got a bit of torine as a treat when i found one of theirs i was to take a vial of the emergency medication id been given and take them into custody or take them down whatever was in those vials was fantastic it was always like flying i would inflict pain tear off flesh and skin and burn out peoples eyes with a touch all while flying above it all i was charged with tracking this one girl towards the end of my service with the inquisition she was a pretty little thing but she was also a warlock her powers were horrible devastating not unlike my own but because she was on the other side they were alien and disgusting she could conjure fire electricity anything she wanted she had to be in pain though and it had to be enough pain to be of use i was chasing her once again she was my last assignment but she kept getting away we were fighting through a city i forget the city now but it was a big one near the ocean i was starting to come down i couldnt let myself come down in the middle of a fight but i was too busy chasing her to get one of my vials open i found her in an alley crying to herself you see to get the pain she needed to cast any of her magic she was cutting herself in her haste she cut herself way too deep she was bleeding out in shock fearful and there i was rapidly coming down afraid that i wouldnt be happy enough to finish her off so im standing there struggling with my emergency vial trying to get the cap off but it wont come off i broke down she was trying to feel pain through her shock so she could finish me off and im trying to get high enough that i can kill her
3841744 before i could get my vial open he the mage lord the one wed been hunting for years came out and slammed me into a wall repeatedly with a wave of his hand he smashed all but one of my vials on the ground even the viarte he then rubbed a pinch full of dust over the last vial of torine i had and handed it to me he told me it was poisoned that it would kill me instantly if i took it he knew i was desperate just to even myself out he scooped up the girl she was almost unconscious at this point and left me there weeping over my poisoned vial in the middle of the alley i spent three days searching for an inquisitor that whole time i couldnt find a single vial of viarte or torine i did horrible things to try and get some but all i had was my poisoned vial i found an inquisitor he took a look at my vial and told me that it was fine he tasted it himself it was fine id been tricked i spent three days in absolute hell having to live with everything id done everything id become and the whole time i had the ticket out right there in front of me i couldnt take torine again every vial i was handed became that poisoned vial they tried everything to get me functional again but nothing worked so they left me they dropped me in some no name town on the mainland with a months worth of viarte and a single vial of torine they figured that eventually the brotherhood would find me and kill me that was four years ago
3841745 the brotherhood regards itself as merciful miss gend but for a creature as foul violent and horrible as yourself we can have little mercy
3841746 i want you to hit me brother yanin i want you to hit me very very hard
3841747 why are we even in ecidia we should have flown to narlyocria and picked up something illicit it feels like were wasting time just flying around with an empty hull and nothing smuggled in
3841748 were going to edora to pick up a shipment of clock work parts and take them to the protectorate and then exchange them for some raw bars which we will return to edora with and then sell for considerable profit
3841749 we should have picked something up on the way then raided a farm or something just for some laughs and profit
3841750 were privateers not outright pirates or bandits we made some good coin smuggling crystals out of narlyocria and if everything goes well well make a rather tasty profit in these next few exchanges
3841751 i miss when we were just rough and tumble pirate types fighting in bars stealing from anyone who turned their backs and laughing off into the sky in the middle of the night
3841752 we were none of those things you typically would just get drunk in bars and id have to drag you back to the ship most of our heists were poorly planned poorly executed and resulted in little to no coin being gained and finally the few hurried escapes weve been forced to endure have had little to no humor in them
3841753 shush you let a girl dream of days long gone by without tainting them with your dreary reality
3841754 that response was almost lucid i think i may actually be pounding some sense into that brain of yours after all
3841755 you respect your captain or ill haul you off the side of the ship like the runt you are
3841756 that would require you to actually be able to leave the wheel for more than a few seconds without both of us spiraling to our deaths if you would only put the money up for the tail repairs we could actually use the auto pilot again
3841757 tiana get your rifle weve got company off the port side
3841758 hold fire until we see what their intentions are theyre probably just scouting us as we make our approach if you see them loading weapons or preparing to fire on us work your magic im going to try to take us into a better air stream for combat
3841759 aye holding nothing hostile yet they dont have anyone actively scanning us yet theyve got the crest of the customs officials on their bow
3841760 then were good lower your weapon and lets fly white to show them were nice and friendly everyones friendly up here
3841761 greetings ladies welcome to ecidia were officials from the customs department im marshal gidesar and we happened to see you flying towards the capital do you folks have anything you wish to declare
3841762 no sir were flying in with an empty hull and a desire to spend some coin in your fine city
3841763 good to hear we wont keep you girls long xal athe mind hopping over and checking their cargo hold quickly and well let them be on their way
3841764 good to hear which of you two is the captain
3841765 do you have the ships registry and papers handy for inspection
3841766 certainly tiana you know where they are mind fetching them for me
3841767 well i plan to pick up some new boots maybe a new hat probably hit some bars get into a bit of trouble you know typical saturday night in the big city
3841768 your captain tells me she plans to get into a bit of trouble in the city
3841769 my captain cannot walk two blocks without getting herself into something she shouldnt sir
3841770 says here this ship wasnt originally yours belonged to some fellow named davis
3841771 old friend left the ship to me when he passed on
3841772 well everything here looks like it checks out wed appreciate it if youd make right for the capital present them with this document and you can bypass the inspection there as weve already taken care of that up here the document clears you for three days and nights within edora should you plan on staying longer please see the customs and immigration office for an extension
3841773 every minute of that was just death customs doesnt even wait for us to land anymore before doing their goddamn searches tiana make a note were never not smuggling something into ecidia ever again
3841774 though i will say this if they can spot us coming in at day and are inclined to search us so casually we might as well load up on illicits next time particularly if this document turns out to be the real deal if we can land and hit the trade district without a full search with this thing ill never fly into ecidia at night again
3841775 lets not count our sheep until after the customs office has thoroughly examined and confiscated them
3841776 i suspect since they could see us from the city far enough out to dispatch that ship to intercept us that theyd see the battle and probably send out reinforcements not that we couldnt make for a border and hope they broke off but it certainly would make things interesting
3841777 it works now from top to bottom it probably hasnt worked or looked like this since the 1970s
3841778 the airport will make a great home for the clock over the next couple of years
3841779 there is no question that the clock of the nations is a true community treasure and a significant part of rochesters history
3841780 women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea
3841781 youre going to be the big sister or big brother
3841782 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic breakup
3841783 its just slowed down whos to say where it will end up but now he has a lot going on

3841818 or would he simply fall horribly to a lonely death at the foot of the abbey spire and leave his scrotum at the pinnacle as a sort of makeshift shrine to his passing
3841819 mooney is the cur who almost ruined the economy of spanx eh i say we do more than hang mooney up by his scrotum i say we suffocate him with it
3841820 but hes not here how can you 132 suffocate an absentee
3841821 mooney were going to knock you stupid with these beans then hang you from the abbey spire by your scrotum
3841822 is why someone from an advanced society such as yours would bother owning a dreadful little hovel like the rancid maggot inn i mean its ghastly i feel like i want to wash my paws all the time and im certain ive picked up some ghastly fur complaint here too
3841823 how much did you pay for our lizard pasties and rough ale

3841832 the lord kills and brings to life he brings down to sheol and raises up

3841836 kingdom of god on earth rather than in heaven note the following two lds scripture statements
3841837 we believe in the literal gathering of israel and in the restoration of the ten tribes that zion the new jerusalem will be built upon the american continent that christ will reign personally upon the earth and that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory
3841838 and the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things in whose bosom it is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall inherit it the earth therefore it the earth must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness that it may be prepared for the celestial glory for after it hath filled the measure of its creation it shall be crowned with the glory even with the presence of god the father wherefore it the earth shall be sanctified yea notwithstanding it shall die it shall be quickened again and shall abide the power by which it is quickened and the righteous shall inherit it
3841839 what we should be talking about is food security not food production
3841840 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3841841 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water
3841842 it takes it to a whole new level when you see the game on a screen thats more than 50 feet wide

3841909 to me it seemed more gimmicky a hot chick in the future who does parkour than substantive to me the first person perspective really didnt work for a game where youre trying to manipulate a character through complex spatial puzzles and the challenge often felt more about timing can you jump off this ledge with enough speed at the very last second than brains

3841938 parents are being very alarmist it is just due to their ignorance and because it is a gun shop
3841939 firearm related incidents compared to those with hockey sticks or baseball bats incidents is minimal the history of gun shops being broken into by criminals in sydney is also minimal non existent
3841940 they imagined bikies coming in and buying guns and people having gunfights in the streets or the shop getting robbed every second week
3841941 now if you interviewed people from the area i dont think they would say they are living in fear

3841953 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today

3841969 western countries should not support them israel so much the life of this regime has come to an end
3841970 our position is clear on this issue a referendum should take place in palestine if they withdraw from invaded lands it would be a good step
3841971 russias ongoing action raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3841972 will personally convey americas unwavering support for georgias democratic government on this trip she will continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3841973 in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3841974 we fully expect russia to keep its word to provide free access to humanitarian assistance and allow any of our assistance to arrive either by military or commercial means by air land and sea

3841979 he has two options to stay and fight or quit and go home
3841980 if he fights back we are with him we will support him and that is the preferred option
3841981 using that power would be undemocratic under the present circumstances even though it is in the constitution the democratic process should continue

3841987 no resolution passed by any provincial assembly has any relevance to the impeachment of the president and if the coalition has any case it must follow the proper course by moving a motion in the parliament
3841988 the tidal wave against president pervez musharraf shows that all the democratic forces are together for his impeachment

3841992 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3841993 current uncertain economic conditions combined with a significant downturn in rv demand
3841994 the price of gas will impact a persons travel habits but for the rv industry its really about the lack of financing thats causing the current downward trend in rv sales
3841995 consumer confidence is factor too people have less confidence to make a larger ticket purchase and rvs are discretionary purchases so theyre more difficult to justify
3841996 but its not like the suv market where everyone is running away because of the price of gas
3841997 one of the common ways people finance an rv purchase especially for the bigger vehicles is by taking out a home equity loan and that has of course become more problematic lately because home prices have fallen and people have less home equity
3841998 theres about four five six different variables not just one focus point you have escalating food prices you cant turn on the tv or radio without hearing its another record setting day for fuel and i think thats probably one of the biggest concerns right now not only of rvers but everybody they dont know where this is going to settle in

3842034 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3842035 we have credible reports of villages being burned shootings and killings
3842036 russian tanks are going through villages inhabited by the georgian population and throwing people out of the houses pushing people into concentration camps that they are setting up in those villages and separating men and women
3842037 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3842038 taking advantage of this lull we are reburying those killed in the georgian aggression

3842058 crowdspring brings the power of choice to individuals and businesses and creates a community for untapped creative talent
3842059 when people buy art or music or movies they see all the options available to them and then decide which theyd like to purchase but the purchase of many other creative services has traditionally been a lot more risky
3842060 buyers are asked to dig through portfolios review past work and make a commitment before seeing the end product crowdspring offers a better way buyers can now purchase the work they love at a price they set without the risk
3842061 we also showed that great creative talent exists in every corner of the world and comes from people you would never have guessed

3842063 they are important and interesting conclusions but they take place within a very controlled context and are not necessarily applicable in all countries
3842064 the evidence is quite sound but it is in a way indirect there are practical political and ethical difficulties for doing this type of study
3842065 you have to explain to people all of the details also if antiretroviral treatment stops working in the infected individual because it generates resistance that person is going to start to transmit the virus

3842072 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3842073 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3842074 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3842075 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3842076 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3842077 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3842078 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3842079 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3842080 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3842081 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3842082 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3842083 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3842084 mary gave birth to it and three guys brought it some presents
3842085 we all know youve been sucking brets c0 k every night
3842086 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3842087 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3842088 mtv needs to play more videos we dont want to see reality tv

3842122 it would have been nice to be competing in the team final but doing the all around competition will be a lot of fun
3842123 theyve been working so hard in the past few months of training camps and they deserve to be in the all around final and i think theyre going to achieve best results for canada there

3842138 they will be looking at cyberspace and the cyber command capabilities and try to determine the best way forward with that as of this point in time today we have not officially been told to put anything on hold

3842147 if you are a patient and have allergy problems and suffering if you check the pollen count and its very high then you need to plan ahead
3842148 you should not be outside more than eight hours without taking your allergy medication
3842149 if we were to implement georgian president mikhail saakashvilis absurd demand that we halt our peacekeeping operation in abkhazia the region will risk being plunged deeper into crisis by the unhealthy ambitions of the incumbent georgian leadership

3842174 women in iraq today are either using violence to protest the loss of their society or the loss of their country to an occupation they dont believe in recall that the first two female bombers in march 2003 who detonated themselves days after u s forces entered baghdad declared on television that their primary motive was to protect iraq from a foreign invader
3842175 women had carried out more than 20 missions in iraq this year the most violent one yet for the women of al qaeda for almost 10 years we have warned that women would start playing a more aggressive role in groups like al qaeda
3842176 because im speaking to a largely western audience i use the term al qaeda loosely when im speaking to a muslim audience i never use the word al qaeda and the reason why is because it is such a vague term and because it is interpreted in so many different ways i will say that why i use this term is because the u s military uses this term and so in any kind of feedback that ive gotten from commanders there and im talking about heads of intelligence operations who are working in the diyala province this is the terms they are most comfortable with because they view and that all these attacks that are being perpetrated fall under the al qaeda rubric
3842177 in the case of iraq i am referring to the overall insurgency but you cant use the same term al qaeda in other parts of the world

3842180 manifold is the first gis to exploit massively parallel supercomputer technology on a desktop using inexpensive plug in cards that provide hundreds of processors for less than 500 that enables gis tasks and analysis to be completed hundreds of times faster than before through an innovative use of inexpensive consumer hardware

3842199 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3842200 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

3842205 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3842206 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3842253 the department is gratified that the court recognized the complexities and uncertainties involved in this case
3842254 we look forward to working with the court the congress and the plaintiffs to bring the case to final closure

3842300 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3842301 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3842302 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3842303 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3842304 seven year old yang peiyi looks apparently failed the cuteness test with officials organizing the ceremony but chen said her voice was judged the most beautiful

3842480 the number looks disturbingly bullish but well probably see some rebound in gasoline supplies next week now that refineries are back online after the storm
3842481 weve got a good sized really going here today but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3842482 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3842483 rules have changed meaning funds will only be given to performers
3842484 sometimes we visit upcountry and people ask us what so many of these organizations do that is no more funding will only go to groups with tangible programs
3842485 the system has now changed and all funding will be through cnls because it the authority that oversees the fight against hiv aids in the country
3842486 many inmates may actually believe that since they are already incarcerated nobody is going to fool with prosecuting them and give them more time
3842487 his role in it on the inside is to gain names social security numbers and dates of birth from inmates who are willing to participate in the scams by providing that information for a cut of the return once it comes in
3842488 we continue to stress our defense and really work hard at that end of the floor

3842490 they are getting better each game and what you can expect from spain is they are athletic they play with a lot of passion and energy and feed off it

3842498 phillip was instrumental in getting two excellent mortgage refinancing deals for me one in 2005 and the other in 2008
3842499 the first time i came here was a few years back the night of the marina challenge
3842500 i had a seriously good time riding my bike from fishermans wharf over the gg bridge to sausalito and then onward to mill valley 6 miles
3842501 well with this fit youll know without a doubt if the problems are the bike or your body
3842502 oh great i just spent this money to get my seat lowered a couple shims in my cleat and an adjustment on my handlebars
3842503 i dont think rainbow grocery is particularly cost effective when it comes to their produce which costs about the same as tj or even
3842504 mcateer hs my task included driving him to his graduation site but i didnt want to show up empty handed and wanted to get him some balloons and flowers
3842505 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3842506 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3842507 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3842508 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3842509 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3842510 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3842511 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3842512 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3842513 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3842514 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3842515 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3842516 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3842517 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3842518 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3842519 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3842520 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3842521 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3842522 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
3842523 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3842524 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3842525 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3842526 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
3842527 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
3842528 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3842529 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think lee harvey oswald is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a conspiracy theory
3842530 ive seen the theories that he was a pawn like lee harvey oswald thats going to be hard to disprove
3842531 how do you disprove that a dead man was not a puppet being manipulated by the cia youre talking about proving a negative you cant prove aliens didnt mail the letters

3842577 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth
3842578 these low cost amplifying devices can look tempting to individuals with hearing impairment because of the significant cost differences
3842579 but our research found that the low cost aids generally dont meet the fitting requirements to help a hearing impaired person and could potentially damage a persons hearing
3842580 aside from being of extremely poor quality very low cost hearing aids those under 100 have the potential to damage your hearing because they send very loud sounds into the ear the studys mid range hearing aids 100 500 were of higher quality and were not considered a safety hazard
3842581 based on the research the best advice for consumers is to talk to an audiologist because hearing aids have complex technical features they need to be fitted and customized to the individual
3842582 currently more than 32 million people have a hearing impairment yet only about 25 percent of those use hearing aids
3842583 meanwhile the aging population is growing and hearing loss becomes more common as we become older
3842584 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
3842585 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
3842586 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
3842587 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
3842588 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us
3842589 many magazines are freelancer driven so while there might be an occasional staff cut or maybe one or two contributing editors might disappear from a masthead youre not talking about the same sheer number of employees as papers have

3842601 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read

3842620 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business
3842621 i will try absolutely anything if it might reduce energy prices
3842622 either youre for renewable energy or youre for off shore drilling
3842623 im for both and for anything else that will help lower energy prices
3842624 the court recognizes that although the defendants are the parties who must be ordered to pay into the civil penalty and forfeiture fund the moneys that should have been paid to the public schools but were improperly retained by the agencies for their own use ultimately it is the general assembly that will decide whether to appropriate sufficient funds to those agencies to allow them to make the required payments without disrupting their ongoing operations the court also recognizes that the general assembly has final responsibility for state appropriations to the public schools and can use that power to determine the net benefit the schools derive from this judgment

3842628 please god please god please god make everything be okay
3842629 four seconds do they last that long i dont know
3842630 no it is either something or nothing it is never just a little something
3842631 im an old lady what can you expect these things happen
3842632 the radiologist says everything is fine just come back in six months for another scan
3842633 i just got diagnosed with ms not even a year ago i just couldnt deal with something else
3842634 theres no question that its the little things i miss most just talking to him the things you cant do anymore
3842635 its been a very very hard year a long year
3842636 im looking forward to the challenge its a similar small school like bucknell with good academics hopefully ill just keep moving forward in the right direction
3842637 what wake forest did was just unbelievable they did everything they were very very good to us
3842638 when we committed we didnt commit just to coach prosser but to the school for an education and to the program as a family and to teammates
3842639 we werent going to leave just because the head coach died
3842640 the one thing skip told me was how each kid came from great families and the values were in the right order
3842641 he described each one of them a lesser person may have been tempted to leave after prosser died but it didnt surprise me that they all stayed they never wavered
3842642 we stayed because we wanted to keep the tradition going
3842643 coach gaudio was with coach prosser for 20 something years so we figured they had the right man for the job and we would have a lot of success
3842644 that was huge because this whole business is about credibility and for us to retain those kids then that was the first big stamp of credibility
3842645 they will be three of the most talented players in the league
3842646 were still a young team but weve got even more talent and now we have juniors and seniors who know what to do in certain situations
3842647 tony can bang with anyone that has collegiate strength hes not afraid to get down and dirty farouq has the face up game i can take you out on the perimeter and i can run as a big man we all have things we can do and we fit perfectly
3842648 an edgy contemporary spin off of the iconic drama 90210 looks at life through the eyes of annie wilson shenae grimes whose first day at west beverly hills high school leaves no doubt theyre not in kansas anymore
3842649 i just didnt want to miss so much time weve got one of the best teams and schedules in the country i wasnt expecting any of this when they first told me in akron that it was my hamstring then the acl came out of nowhere from the first doctor in l a then we met with two more doctors who gave me better news
3842650 it was two hours lots of media people 100 plus he signed a contract with the attorney owner and it was like an nba press conference
3842651 im so excited jennings said by phone from las vegas where he had been training the past week
3842652 i cant believe that it happened so fast i remember sonny vaccaro the former grassroots basketball camp director talking about it and then i called him and it happened so fast already
3842653 lets just see how the first year goes jennings said as to whether or not he would stay more than one season
3842654 i guess they want to make me the icon there theyre real excited about me coming to work for them they know the deal they know what theyre getting in and feel comfortable about the whole situation
3842655 i am really happy for his arrival in rome brandon is one of the greatest american talents and he is considered as one of the top players for the next nba draft its a big deal for us to have a player with such qualities
3842656 we are really happy to have reached an important agreement never done before with a player of great qualities as brandon is despite his young age enthusiasm and talent that is what we expect brandon will bring to rome
3842657 if i feel that someone is out for themselves i dont give a darn who it is they wont play
3842658 i didnt think there was any way in hades that wed have all three back
3842659 the 05 team had six or seven guys but this team has a chance to go much deeper
3842660 on the 05 team we won just 19 games the year before so there was no reason to be fat and happy none of those guys thought about the nba and the nba had no interest in them they were hungry to show people they were a big time basketball team if this team adopts that attitude and shows everybody then well be fine
3842661 we got to a point last season where we were ok defensively
3842662 we have to get to a point where were really good the 97 team was the best defensive team i ever coached the 2005 team held illinois and michigan state to below 30 percent in shooting in one half in the final four
3842663 its the most dumbfounded ive ever been as a coach
3842664 in the locker room we prepared like we did every game in the acc and in the ncaa theyd all been the same and the kids appeared to have a good focus im just dumbfounded still dumbfounded kansas just came in and hit us in the mouth
3842665 and in playing kentucky michigan state and the maui games i think those kinds of games will get us ready
3842666 i was really excited but i got by myself and just said to coach i wish you could be here
3842667 there were so many times during the season that brought back memories that would really affect me i had so many mixed emotions id be excited and then get sad it was an emotional roller coaster a very difficult year
3842668 i dont know if the program had ever been at a lower point
3842669 we were in shambles emotionally the staff the players the wake fan base students we had to quickly pick ourselves up and move on
3842670 wed be in a different position if he would have brought in a different coach from the outside
3842671 coach gaudio knew the system it was the same system just a different approach
3842672 wellman moved so decisively so swiftly that it allowed dino the monumental task of picking up the pieces and putting it all together
3842673 dino had the most difficult job in america last year in terms of coaching and trying to deal with the loss of his mentor and friend
3842674 at the same time he had to find a balance and make this his team he did a superb job
3842675 he meant so much to me and i cared so much about him
3842676 i was always giving him as much credit as i possibly could if another coach had filled his shoes he would have said what a great person what a great coach skip prosser was but after a point he might have said he had heard enough about this guy
3842677 the players knew dino as an assistant but once they saw him in that first practice as a head coach implementing his philosophies those kids eyes got real wide
3842678 skip was always more laid back dino got right in your teeth and is a ball of fire
3842679 i really wish we would have gotten into postseason play
3842680 that was the only thing disappointing to me we should have been in postseason play
3842681 there was a reminder of skip in every game and rightfully so
3842682 but you could see the team taking on his personality at the end of last season with how they played it will be even more this season
3842683 we feel this is our time our year we have no excuses we had a good year we tried to earn an ncaa berth for coach prosser last year well do it again for him this year and every other season for him too
3842684 theyll get everything bags uniforms shoes travel wear the whole nine yards
3842685 theres no question that this allows us to get with better players now that were one of his main people in gear and that he plays open gym here and put his camp here and the aau event here
3842686 perception is reality weve found that the lebron connection helps us when we ask a kid if hes ever been to ohio a number of them will say that they played in the aau event here in april were taking more shots at kids and all it takes is to get one or two
3842687 we kept lebron around the program for an extended period of time
3842688 he likes me but he loves them im his coach but those are his buddies just having them here kept him more tied to the program were his school if you ask him
3842689 he gave my friends an opportunity to play college basketball and im giving back to akron
3842690 hopefully this can attract kids to come to akron and make coach dambrots program better
3842691 i would like to be the person that they can build on
3842692 lebron didnt make me see it but when i did get here i did realize that lebron was an asset for the school
3842693 i didnt know that he supported the school or that he grew up here
3842694 weve positioned ourselves to be a consistent winner but the first thing we have to do is get in the ncaa tournament
3842695 this will be the true test for us with the freshmen can we win this year if we can then we have a great chance to propel instead of taking a step back i believe we did the right thing by going with young kids to maintain this we may not be as good but we still will win our share
3842696 we believe the sector will suffer from a slowdown in customer demand and a pick up in churn typical for a slowing economy this will in turn lead to further price competition particularly in the long distance markets volume growth is slowing at the same time that the long distance industry has added huge amounts of capacity unfavorable market conditions will likely limit access to new capital
3842697 these business models have high operating leverage and a slight slowdown in revenues will have a very negative impact on ebitda
3842698 we expect some of the smaller private clecs to go bankrupt which could pressure valuations in the sector
3842699 uh yeah greg whenever i do my sets i make sure to get that mind muscle connection
3842700 pr sent dans chaque ville il vous sera alors possible de choisir le personnage
3842701 its unfair for gas stations to impose a hold on their customers own money for amounts that exceed how much theyve spent on gas visa deserves credit for taking this step now its time for mastercard to end unfair debit holds at the pump and for every gas station to adopt this new process
3842702 high gas prices are already putting a strain on many family budgets
3842703 for some consumers a lengthy debit hold can make matters worse by making it harder to pay for other necessities or by triggering overdrawn bank accounts and penalty fees
3842704 i listened to george bushs statement and was surprised the facts he cited are untrue
3842705 we understand that the u s is concerned about the fate of this project but the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3842706 no mention was made about what happened on august 8 when western leaders fell silent while tskhinvali was shelled and bombed
3842707 the western political elite only got excited when russia made the decision not to abandon its peacekeepers and to prevent ethnic cleansing sending reinforcements to carry out an operation to force georgia to accept peace
3842708 only a bitch with two boobs that would not make a mouthful combined makes a comment like that
3842709 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
3842710 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
3842711 put the cat out and turn your alarm on you dumb arse
3842712 i think its a great victory for nevada civil rights i want to get into a court and take this all the way ive opened the floodgates for complaints
3842713 while this may be true this reason is not persuasive
3842714 calls into question such practices as charging different prices for seniors or children at movies or attractions such as museums or amusement parks
3842715 thats interesting but i really want to know how to give my alleged 500 buck race car an unfair advantage at the next race and get away with it
3842716 hey dont tell me thats not a factory part im the president of the north american car make model club and ive got a dozen of them in my back yard
3842717 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction
3842718 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3842719 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3842720 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3842721 the dictatorships propaganda lied for 40 years saying that the pazo was paid for by popular subscription as a gift for franco
3842722 but they bought it through extortion by imposing a revolutionary tax on galician citizens
3842723 as much for its uniqueness as for its cultural and symbolic significance the pazo has all the characteristics necessary to obtain the maximum degree of protection
3842724 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
3842725 to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3842726 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
3842727 probably the most important thing is to make decisions now before the wind starts blowing
3842728 medicines are a huge concern if youre leaving the area
3842729 this is part of preparedness deciding now where youll shelter your pets
3842730 the county is not going to provide it food for your pets
3842731 we started with two shelters and saw what a huge success they were
3842732 you need to know ahead of time where youre going to go
3842733 its difficult to live through a disaster its worse if you havent planned for it
3842734 when i started doing yoga with mandy i noticed many things
3842735 my legs getting leaner my arms getting stronger and most importantly an inner strength i feel like im getting a meditation a workout and time with my friend all rolled into one hour
3842736 john has been living the 5 factor lifestyle for 3 years and kicked it up over the last six months
3842737 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3842738 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3842739 new york gave me my words and my music and rock and roll gave me a place for that music to live
3842740 there really isnt a more fitting spot for this museum than new york the hometown of hall of famers like the velvet underground paul simon and blondie this is where ed sullivan met the beatles where lou reed took a walk on the wild side
3842741 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit

3842885 all these areas we controlled since 2003 but now they are coming and attacking and now they are in the control of the government
3842886 they are readying to move to other places the government is cheating us and cheating the international community they are going to destroy all the places to control them

3842891 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations

3842893 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3842894 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade

3842910 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3842911 had credible reports that russia is violating the cease fire agreement including as bush mentioned the bombing of vessels and the blocking of the port which were very concerned about

3842915 but the states leaders have failed to act therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3842916 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3842917 the rotolo book is not worth the money and i must say that i am astounded at how much critical praise it received
3842918 rotolos new age y writing style is in places abominable moreover though the dylan information is somewhat interesting hardcore fans will not glean much that is news or unknown
3842919 whats worse is that rotolo seems determined to keep certain aspects of her memory to herself so her disclosures become mere half disclosures
3842920 in the sections where rotolo discusses her life independent of dylan i skimmed or skipped when i did try to read these passages i found them uninteresting at best
3842921 if you really want to see the dylan specific stuff in the book i recommend simply waiting until you can borrow a copy

3843041 if people if muslims start to understand their religion first of all their religion and see how awful stuff is in there theyll start to figure out this cant be because most religious people focus on certain points of islam they have many points that they are very embarrassed to talk about
3843042 my message to them is first of all to open their minds they were born to muslim families this is how they got islam and this is just like any other religion like growing up in a christian family or growing up in a jewish family so my point is that i want those people to open their eyes their minds to start to understand and imagine that they werent born for a muslim famiily and use their minds why did god give them minds open their hearts study their religion i want to open the gate for them i want them to be free

3843084 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3843086 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3843087 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3843105 the land of extreme saw its share of superstars looking for revenge after what happened last week here is what i mean
3843106 ecw original tommy dreamer took on his former protege turned traitor in colin delaney who turned on his mentor 3 weeks ago at the great american bash when he cost him a shot at the ecw championship and last week cost him his match against armando estrada giving him his ecw contract delaney wanted no part of this match so he tried running back to the locker room but dreamer caught him and started using all of his weapons he had on delaney including kendo sticks garbage cans and traffic signs then dreamer nails delaney with a hard hitting ddt giving him the win with another loss under his belt you think that colin delaney has learned his lesson by now
3843107 speaking of armando estrada he toasted the new ecw contract with ecw general manager teddy long and his super sexy assistant tiffany tiffany was looking ever so hot in black the celebration was cut short when estrada learned that his first match as an ecw superstar was against finlay estradas record is now 0 1 when he lost against the man who loves to fight as mike knox was looking finlay won the match he started urging knox to come down to the ring and find out that finlay isnt soft at all but knox wanted no part of him at all as he walked away come on knox it looks to me that you are the one who is soft i think that you knox are afraid of what might happen to you when you get in the ring with finlay
3843108 then the high flyer evan bourne took on bam neely for the second week in a row but this time in singles action bam neely who was not at 100 after what happened to him and chavo guererro last friday night on smackdown at the hands of edge neely was ordered by chavo to compete against bourne regardless of his concussion but bourne took adavantage of the situtation as he nailed neely with his shooting star press off the top rope giving him the victory if the wwe should one day decide to bring back the cruiserweight championship evan bourne would be champion for a long time to come

3843121 the states of india are held together by force and not by the sentiment of a common nationality it is an assumption that makes a mockery of the indian nation and a tyrant of the indian state
3843122 the change from his own early marxist phase is reflected in the contrast between his praise for state power in why socialism written in 1935 and his censure of it in from socialism to sarvodaya more than 20 years later but he later went further to find sarvodaya inadequate in remedying deep rooted social ills and stressed the need to mobilise mass struggle he grew increasingly impatient and justified violence if the government failed to perform as he announced in new delhi in 1969

3843194 we were able to characterize the motion of the receptor proteins in the membrane in real time as they respond to the antigen
3843195 perhaps more importantly we learned the cell membrane is really complicated and highly structured rather than fluid and unstructured as is the prevailing notion
3843196 when proteins bind antigens they begin to cluster this causes other proteins to thrash around that sends a message from the membrane to the cell nucleus that somethings wrong
3843197 but if there are places on the membrane that are walled off and an antigen lands there the cell may not be notified theres a problem no protein no warning

3843222 its the love of the game i live for football
3843223 to have them cut me no matter how many times just made me go home hungrier and work out harder i get another opportunity to play football its a lot easier to return because i got to know the people that cuts some of the uncertainty out i just need to learn to hold my own
3843224 to his credit he stayed ready and he didnt burn bridges and we didnt burn our bridges with him now well have a chance to have a real good look
3843225 it actually made me have tougher skin it made me learn the business
3843226 coming in i thought it was like college i would come in and play i came in like a redshirt i knew i had to learn the ropes
3843227 i was saying this is such a crazy business youre living day to day
3843228 then they called me and let me know i was released i was really surprised i couldnt believe it
3843229 i was kind of homeless living between my frat brothers houses thinking about having to go back home and live with mom

3843239 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3843240 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3843241 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3843242 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3843243 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3843244 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3843245 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3843246 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3843247 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3843248 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3843249 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3843250 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3843251 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3843252 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3843253 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3843254 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3843255 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them

3843281 i have contacted many members of the westmoreland county republican committee and there is overwhelming support for ms ward myself included he said
3843282 after much thought and consideration and many calls asking me to enter the partys nomination process to replace sen regola i have decided to do so ms ward said in a statement today
3843283 wasnt something i was seeking or planned to do she said
3843284 but this unexpected turn of events and outpouring of calls of encouragement from friends and strangers has led me to believe it is something that needed to be done

3843287 they can find their favorite junk foods they meet students who wear the same kind of clothes use the same ipods even use the same americanisms it is not a culture shock that you might get say in china or japan

3843289 for years we always thought it would be great to have our own beer
3843290 people like them because they re big only sold in the 22 ounce size
3843291 people love the labels and then people are surprised to find out that the beer s really good the financial arrangement included a signing bonus and some future residuals mr gratt said but has brought nonprofits for the nonprofit so far still he added we hope it ll be a nice little chunk of change as we go forward

3843297 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3843298 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3843299 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3843300 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out

3843313 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3843314 but the states leaders have failed to act therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3843315 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3843316 no one gave us a chance in the beginning saying we werent going to advance
3843317 we improved each game and the bond and chemistry we developed as players in such a short amount of time is something special
3843318 when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3843319 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3843320 so the fact that the cost of borrowing money has dropped over the last 10 days has had limited impact
3843321 basically we have a situation where all of the term deposits are rolling over at the moment at a higher rate of around 150 200 basis points and all of the long term funding we are rolling over at a higher rate
3843322 the good news is that in a pinch the rba has a big 7 25 percentage points to work with
3843323 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3843324 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3843325 we received and were able to process incoming dvds tuesday morning but due to a technology issue we werent able to send e mails confirming dvd receipt and we wont ship any dvds

3843330 if they wanted to book a four hour window we could certainly go later in the evening
3843331 if the theatre manager has the staffing they could go till two in the morning
3843332 in times like these the challenge is to present a product that represents good value and a good home entertainment solution and i think we have been substantially effective in doing that
3843333 in the course of the second six months of the year we actually got churn down from what wed had in the first six months of the year so i think our settings are pretty good and our growth has continued to be solid
3843334 vanya may not strike the perfect balance between irony and tears near certainly captures the solace of laughter
3843335 who but a stupid barbarian would destroy what he cannot make man has been endowed with reason in order to increase what hes been given and what have we done

3843340 there is at least one na on each machine and an na must be able to start all server instances on the machine independent of the clusters to which the instances belong there can be multiple node agents on a machine for different versions of the product or in cases where the instances on the machine reside in multiple domains
3843341 in the vast majority of websites we identified it was plain that they were offering these drugs and doing so in a way that violates u s federal law frankly one doesnt have to be an expert to see what these websites are doing
3843342 we also received and in some cases presented to the registrars information from the website operator with information about the drugs including photos and instructions for payment
3843343 we think that these sites are fairly straightforward to identify in many cases and the remedy termination is equally clear
3843344 each of the sites in the report have been investigated by our 24x7 abuse department and do not appear to be violating our terms of service we hope in the future through reform from congress we can easily identify rogue vendors selling drugs illegally

3843354 kasi nga maiintindihan ko kung bibigyan ako ng sitcom e kasali ako sa isang sitcom pero biglang host sabi ko bakit ako pinagho host tapos kahit medyo nakakatawa yong pagkaka host iba pa rin talaga siya
3843355 ang sabi naman sa akin madali lang pero hindi mahirap sa hosting pero napagod ako noong first taping day ko ibang iba siya iba ang makipag usap sa camera na alam mo dapat ang sinasabi mo trying to entertain your audience so sana naman magawa ko siya ng mabuti

3843403 we want him to promise he will never leave a priest in place after four allegations have been made we want him to promise he will never try to free a convicted child molester from prison early
3843404 did it ever occur to you in 2002 what it would mean to the victims if you had been successful in facilitating early release of this convicted offender
3843405 that fact that he would never function as a priest again was what most of the victims i spoke to were most concerned about not whether he was in prison or not
3843406 we have tried as you know a number of avenues to see if your sentence might be reduced or parole given early i personally hope you will not lose hope
3843407 this is a fathers letter to a son in prison a sinful son and it was designed to give him some hope and encouragement
3843408 because somebody has to tell me information that i might base a letter on and it isnt always sure what a victim will make of such a letter sometimes victims resent being addressed by a bishop out of the blue we ask the victim when can the cardinal apologize when can the cardinal come into the process that is asked right at the beginning

3843425 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
3843426 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
3843427 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure

3843442 i know very little about them simon when nahum was younger he used to make pictures of thrae and of the woods and valleys hereabouts there are boxfulls put away others are pictures brought back from foreign parts but many of them as i believe
3843443 are pictures of nothing on earth he has his two worlds take your time simon some day you too i dare say will go off on your travels some day perhaps nahum will shake himself free of thrae altogether i dont know myself simon this house is enough for me and what i remember of sure vine compared with which thrae is but the smallest of bubbles in a large glass

3843447 well many of the pictures i take it in mr nahums round tower are of that world his mind i have never examined them my duties are elsewhere your duty is to keep your senses heart and courage and to go where you are called and in black strange places you will at times lose yourself and find yourself simon now mr nahum is calling dont think of me too much i have great faith in him share your eyes with his pictures and having seen them compare them if you will say this is this and that is that and make of all that he has exactly what use you can

3843452 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
3843453 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
3843454 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
3843455 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them

3843493 hoe dan ook is na de invoering van de katalysator de uitstoot van stikstofoxiden gedaald
3843494 de europese commissie sprak met de constructeurs af dat die tegen 2008 de uitstoot van hun modellen zouden beperken tot 140 gram co2 per kilometer in 2006 bedroeg de gemiddelde uitstoot van nieuwe wagens in belgi ongeveer 154 gram voorlopig is de afspraak met de constructeurs vrijwillig omdat het streefdoel wellicht niet wordt gehaald lopen nu onderhandelingen om ook de co2 normen verplicht te maken
3843495 in de brandstof voor schepen zit wel nog veel zwavel maar ook daar komt de komende jaren verandering in de belangrijkste bronnen van so2 zijn op dit moment de industrie de elektriciteitsproductie en de verwarming van gebouwen
3843496 er zijn niet alleen meer voertuigen ingeschreven er worden ook meer kilometers gereden dat zie je aan de totale transportstromen waarbij ook de buitenlandse wagens en vrachtwagens zijn gerekend het totaal aantal kilometers gereden op vlaamse wegen is sedert 1990 gestegen met 32 procent op autosnelwegen met 56 procent
3843497 diesel is voorlopig nog goedkoper aan de pomp dan benzine gemiddeld verbruiken dieselwagens minder dan benzinewagens ze stoten dan ook minder co2 uit maar dieselmotoren stoten wel meer stikstofoxiden en fijn stof uit sommige nieuwere modellen zijn weliswaar reeds uitgerust met een roetfilter maar het zal nog tot 2009 duren vooraleer alle nieuwe wagens die hebben

3843510 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3843511 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3843512 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3843513 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3843514 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3843515 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3843516 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3843517 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3843518 we are as a species very good at coming up with rationalizations and justifications to persuade ourselves why its ok to do whatever we want to do regardless of the consequences or the effects our actions have on others
3843519 michael i dont know anyone who could get through the day without two or three juicy rationalizations theyre more important than sex sam ah come on nothings more important than sex michael oh yeah ever gone a week without a rationalization
3843520 the fact is being ethical means sometimes you dont get to do what you want to do being ethical sometimes means you dont get to fuck someone you really really really really want to fuck thats why justifications are so easy and ethical people are so thin on the ground
3843521 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3843522 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3843523 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3843524 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3843525 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3843526 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3843527 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3843528 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3843529 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3843530 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3843531 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3843532 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3843533 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3843534 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3843535 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3843536 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3843537 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3843538 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3843539 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3843540 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3843541 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3843542 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3843543 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3843544 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3843545 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3843546 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3843547 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3843548 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3843549 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3843550 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3843551 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3843552 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3843553 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3843554 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3843555 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3843556 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3843557 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3843558 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3843559 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3843560 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3843561 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3843562 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3843563 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3843564 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3843565 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3843566 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3843567 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3843568 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3843569 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3843570 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3843571 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3843572 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3843573 i totally understand limiting my funds until the check has cleared because you dont know if there is a check until monday and u verify that it is legitimate so automatically giving overdraft fees is a natural defense by a bank to deter excessive non sufficient funds transactions however once the check is cleared the bank should carry the responsibility of reimbursing the overdraft fees because they now know that the money spent was truly there
3843574 hello officer id like to report a bank robbery in progress no nobody is holding up a bank the bank is stealing from my account
3843575 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3843576 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3843577 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3843578 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3843579 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3843580 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3843581 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3843582 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3843583 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3843584 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3843585 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3843586 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3843587 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3843588 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3843589 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3843590 im absolutely sure there are more mass graves hidden here
3843591 ibms supplier diversity program helps increase purchasing opportunities and contracts with diverse businesses
3843592 the single most important thing is modified mandatory and enforceable reliability standards in the united states and we are working towards that in all of the provinces of canada
3843593 in ontario theres very little that has changed since the blackout because frankly we were already there
3843594 if we continue with our current centralized energy system were vulnerable to power mishaps
3843595 we kind of respected it because the process hadnt been moving
3843596 party officials decided it was fine it was perfectly legal
3843597 dimostrano che le donne che prendono lanticoncezionale preferiscono uomini con odori geneticamente simili questo pu portare non solo a problemi di fertilit ma anche a una rottura della coppia quando la donna smette di assumere la pillola visto che la percezione dellodore gioca un ruolo importante nellessere attratti dal partner
3843598 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3843599 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3843600 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3843601 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3843602 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3843603 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3843604 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3843605 who are open to doing something on the production side
3843606 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3843607 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3843608 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3843609 i wonder what will happen if i pull its wings off
3843610 even as the potent mix of a misfiring economy and consumers changing media habits shave advertising dollars from traditional venues such as newspapers and television internet ad spending will continue to grow rapidly

3843653 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3843654 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3843655 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3843656 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3843657 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3843658 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3843659 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3843660 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3843661 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3843662 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3843663 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3843664 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3843665 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3843666 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3843667 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3843668 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3843669 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3843670 we are very sorry but service is unavailable now please try again later
3843671 its not just music for the united states its world music

3843673 its totally given me a new energey a new everything
3843674 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
3843675 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
3843676 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
3843677 with my fan base being broader and larger now im looking to somewhere where somebody can really take advantage of that and take it to the next level
3843678 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there

3843680 this is a grave warning it is not enough to lean on a biblical text to be right it is not enough to adduce biblical arguments whether theological or pietistic to be in tune with god all this may denote opposition to god it may even be a way of disobeying him the using of gods word to tempt god is a danger which threatens all christians every time the christian thinks he has gods word in store to be used as needed he commits this sin which is that of satan himself against christ this is the attitude of the historian who dissects scripture to set it against scripture of the theologian who uses a text to construct his doctrine or philosophy or of the simple christian who opens his bible to find himself justified there or to find his arguments against non christians or against christians who do not hold the same views arguments which show how far superior my position is to that of others
3843681 when we find in the bible that which justifies us in our own eyes when in reading the bible we say i was right when we see in it an argument for us and against others when we are righteous in our own judgment we can be certain that like jonah we have turned the revelation against god for what revelation teaches us about ourselves is all to the effect that we are not righteous that we have no means of justifying ourselves that we have no possibility of disputing with god that we have no right to condemn others and be in the right against them and that in this extreme distress only a gracious act of god which is external to us though it becomes internal can save us this is what scripture teaches us and if we stick to this reading the bible is useful healthy and brings forth fruit in us
3843682 i think hes going to have his best year ever hes better than ive ever seen him barring anything unknown theres no reason he wont go out and set records
3843683 no not really the 600 cc bikes are about 20 kilograms lighter and also have more power but the two cylinder engine of my bmw perfectly matches my riding style
3843684 it is unbelievable how stunt riding is booming there in the moment
3843685 in this country stunt riding seems to go the same way as skateboarding or bmx in the past
3843686 i have tried a bit to hard rode very aggressively and nearly came off the bike on an extremely tilted donut then i stalled the engine because i unintentionally engaged the side stand which has never happened to me before
3843687 i was writing christian horror before christian horror was cool
3843688 we feel that this game is the ea sports freestyle answer to a great wii party game it explores the lighter side of sports and pulls inspiration from the entertainment spectacles that are so prevalent in pop culture today
3843689 celebrity sports showdown will bring people to the party with a collection of games and celebrities that appeal to everyone
3843690 we did it because we thought it was going to be something nice something with no problem
3843691 but somebody wants to talk about it it is too much of a big deal with you guys the media and everybody talking about that
3843692 if i go to play with a taller team and i put here raising up on the tips of his toes it is not an offense
3843693 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it just because to me it was a little clownish for our part to be doing that
3843694 but the sponsors insisted and insisted i think it is just a bad idea i guess to do that but it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3843695 i didnt find it very funny i didnt find it offensive either i guess some guys didnt mind to me i dont want to be that way i guess to be doing that stuff
3843696 if anybody feels offended by it we totally apologize for it we never meant anything offensive by it
3843697 if you put it in the wrong context and put it with the wrong people or a different kind of people you could take it that way
3843698 but not with our group and not with our people i would find that a wrong read
3843699 stupid loyal and humble customer employee patient or citizen is dead
3843700 these new interfaces make fedex easy to do business with and they make our customers highly productive
3843701 i dont know cheryl why did you break my heart
3843702 my dog died he died and hes never coming back
3843703 theyre going through all that as a team trying to figure out if favre or aaron rodgers was the man while weve got the same team we had all offseason im glad they got all that darn press cause when we go down there itll be the kids first start and his first damn loss
3843704 playing green bay on monday night to start the season thats everything you want
3843705 hopefully i can put my helmet square in the back of his spine if i can do that and knock the ball loose itll be a good day
3843706 they had a nice year last year but they dont understand that brett made those guys better than they were
3843707 he has the game all figured out and youve got to factor all that into the equation brett favre would throw the ball when the receivers hadnt even made their cut yet and it would be there waiting for them those guys had it good
3843708 people think its the system but it aint no damn system brett favre just knows where his guys are going to be at all times and i dont think aaron rodgers has got that yet
3843709 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3843710 it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3843711 we must take the initiative to further develop higher yielding and climate resilient varieties of crop
3843712 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
3843713 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
3843714 to construct and instantiate a set of related objects without specifying their concrete objects
3843715 historically hip hop has been more than entertainment it has motivated movements and been the voice of young people hungry for change
3843716 this agenda is about young people moving forward together it s about turning our individual hopes into concrete possibilities for change check it out sign on and pass it on
3843717 we are not just here to vote we are here to change the world
3843718 it is a fact we won the game but i feel like we lost
3843719 one of our two goals was lucky and there are still areas where we have to improve so we have to learn from our mistakes hopefully we can get better for the next game
3843720 our goalkeeper gave away another christmas present and it is not even november yet i have told him that he has to shape up or i will ship him out
3843721 at this stage where we are you cant give away presents like that if anybody wants to score a goal against us they have to work hard for it
3843722 ambrose is my boy and we are going to speak to him about it and make sure he knows exactly what we expect of him the next match is very crucial and we cant just put him ezenwa in like that
3843723 overall it was not a good game from us every aspect of our game has to improve so far only the defenders have come to the party
3843724 the strikers are not scoring as much as they should with the chances we are creating
3843725 we have too many ball hoggers in the team they need to release the ball quickly but almost everybody wants to hog the ball we have talked about this over and over again and at our training session we work on it two touches pass the ball to the next man and run into space
3843726 but they keep trying to hold on to the ball we will have to do some more work there
3843727 it is better to play badly and get the points than to play well and lose the game the important thing is that we won and we have qualified
3843728 we continue to stress our defense and really work hard at that end of the floor
3843729 oh well records are meant to be broken it feels good but we just wanted to get the win we wanted to come out and perform well

3843756 lo nico que hemos logrado porque los estatutos lo permiten es hacer una comisi n de apoyo y ayuda que va a hacer todo lo humanamente posible para cumplir todo lo que hemos hablado con los jugadores
3843757 los jugadores han vuelto a entrenar y quiero que quede claro la valent a de los jugadores y cuerpo t cnico por todos los inconvenientes que lamentablemente han vivido porque quieren al club porque estamos clasificados a la liguilla sino otro ser a el cantar
3843758 lo nico que ellos dicen es que hoy cambia la tortilla la tortilla estaba negra y para poder empezar bien tiene que volverse diferente y dar la vuelta total
3843759 se les ha mentido tanto que hubo un jugador que dijo yo ya no cree a nadie ojal dios nos ayude para cumplir
3843760 lo nico que pienso es ganar estas son lindas oportunidades para sacar adelante al equipo y mostrarse es algo grande aprovechar la oportunidad

3843764 they are dragging their feet in forcing these banks to reserve realistically some of these banks could have been closed two or three quarters earlier
3843765 in some of these cases i believe regulators should act sooner than later to prevent future losses to the fund

3843769 because we think it is not the right response to the balance of power in europe and between europe and russia and we want to have a dialogue with russia on the subject
3843770 i think the current conflict has moved us away from the map plan moving forward wouldnt be a great idea
3843771 it makes you ask about georgias motives for joining nato
3843772 if you could prove beforehand that had nato extended the map nothing would have happened then sure that looks like an obviously good outcome
3843773 it certainly would have raised the stakes of intervention in russias mind
3843774 the russians could easily have said with the map in place well call the u
3843775 when your credibility is on the line its a very dangerous situation having these bluffs called
3843776 russians think if we attack then that country is automatically excluded from western institutions like nato
3843777 a country thats under occupation with its territory severed and its capital on fire is not a nato country its is not an eu country
3843778 through its actions russia is sending a message not just to georgia but to ukraine

3843785 when you go downrange for 12 months youre packing a lot of stuff
3843786 those who wear the uniform today are a special class of citizen who enable everyone else to enjoy every liberty our great country holds dear

3843790 chunk of change out of a young enlisted mans pocket
3843791 you submit vouchers for portion of travel particularly if youre going to be deployed in a place for a long time
3843792 paying 100 up front and knowing itll be reimbursed quickly is a great electronic advancement but soldiers deploying into a war zone have far more important things on their minds that filing travel vouchers
3843793 meanwhile back on the home front especially for junior enlisted and guard and reservists who are taking a cut in pay while being activated that 100 means groceries and gasoline
3843794 i am so eager to get to beijing and to be with our people

3843799 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from

3843880 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3843881 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3843882 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3843883 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
3843884 we have a real opportunity on our hand over the next couple of years to show people that we have world class cars that were bringing here to the u s

3843887 i led in the abramoff hearings in the in the obscure indian affairs committee for which people are still testifying and going to jail
3843888 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption

3843900 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
3843901 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
3843902 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
3843903 it is a trend that is not favorable to us
3843904 the possibility of a continued decline in sales tax revenue should serve as a reminder that while we want to get each district the best possible facility some extras might have to be scaled back
3843905 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3843906 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3843907 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3843908 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3843909 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3843910 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3843911 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3843912 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3843913 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3843914 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3843915 hey i dont remember dane cooks complexion looking quite so dewy fresh
3843916 hey how the hell are we going to promote this dane cook kate hudson film is it a raunchy adult comedy or a milquetoast rom com for the mary kay and tupperware set i know well make a really stupid poster that has nothing to do with the film and doesnt tell anyone what its about and then get dane cook to go off on it on his blog like it was all his idea
3843917 ricki lieberman is one hillraiser the designation for those who raised over 100 000 for hillary clinton whos not ready to give up the fight responding to jason horowitzs story in this weeks observer in which jason detailed the electability watch newsletter that shes been sending out every night since the democratic primaries ended lieberman has written in to make it clear that her efforts are aimed at one goal securing the democratic nomination in two weeks for hillary clinton who formally conceded the race on june 7
3843918 growing political unrest in places like georgia mauritania and the kashmir province highlight the need for news bureau boots on the ground to ferret out the real story coming out of those unfamiliar far off regions
3843919 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3843920 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3843921 offensive demeaning objectifying and just plain too damn sexually graphic for our daytime readers
3843922 it was supposed to be a picture that inspired the olympic spirit
3843923 whatever political reasons exist for what happened in south ossetia
3843924 the oil and gas markets find themselves right in the cross hairs of the whole thing resource wars fought over oil and gas pipelines water and other key resources seem likely to have a bigger role in the future politicians though will be quick to dress up any such war as being fought over something else
3843925 it is unlikely that aggression against our nato allies will occur with aircraft and tanks and troops
3843926 a nation could achieve the same and worse effects simply by turning off the taps people freeze industry stops
3843927 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field
3843928 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
3843929 this country russia seeks to restore its dominance but the time of dominance is over
3843930 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3843931 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3843932 this allows me to then use the magnet tool to manipulate my plain further select the magnet tool structure gt magnet and click and drag the cursor on the plane to create any desired effect
3843933 how horrible how fantastic how incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing
3843934 the lesson of appeasement that giving in to aggression just invites more aggression has calcified into dogma
3843935 the familiar tropes every dictator is hitler every negotiation is munich do not apply to the challenges facing the next president
3843936 the details of who did what to precipitate russias war against georgia are not very important
3843937 the events of the past week will be remembered that way too
3843938 he didnt have a chance to play and he is just taking fluids currently
3843939 hopefully he will be back this afternoon for wednesdays 5 p m practice if not then hopefully tomorrow
3843940 david should be joining us tomorrow if his workout went well this morning
3843941 it is part of the protocol that if they can work out very hard and there is no dizziness or headaches then they are cleared to come back
3843942 the policy here is the coaches and players have the opportunity to talk to the press
3843943 thats the policy from the head coach so that will always be the case
3843944 all those situations that are new or different they come basically down to principle and the principles in this case are simply that i love both jordan and coach hill and in a very visible situation it is hard on both of them
3843945 then it goes back to the principles of what we are trying to accomplish i gather as many facts as possible first express love for both of them second in individual settings third develop a plan we need to follow out and fourth if there is any accountability that needs to happen address that
3843946 in this particular case not to make light of it but everything we do is visible and if you wre to say in a family situation over breakfast or at night if there is an argument etc sometimes things get said that shouldnt be said and sometimes reactions are built up and people see just the end of it possibly it was escalating before then so in this particular case i think it has been addressed appropriately i dont intend to really have accountability on either side and i think the issue has been resolved the very best way possible and i am anxious now to get jordan back helping so we can move forward

3843948 the business case for delivering industry leading fuel economy performance from our products was too compelling for us to overlook and therefore drove this decision
3843949 we believe this decision demonstrates cummins decisiveness to do whats right to offer the right technology and it demonstrates our agility which we hold as a core value around here
3843950 that product was all set to launch in january 2010
3843951 the program was performing well the product was performing well and we were hitting all our targets
3843952 the first thing customers want to talk about is how we can help them improve their operating cost and primarily fuel economy
3843953 whether youre a fleet or owner operator the value of a percentage or two fuel economy improvement is a big number
3843954 differentiation comes in a lot of different forms its not necessarily defined by what technology you use versus what other people are using
3843955 differentiation with the 07 product line was defined on the customer side by performance reliability durability and how we support our customers and oem partners with our product

3843962 this is actually really interesting this month by my count we have 11 advisories covering 26 vulnerabilities
3843963 there were originally supposed to be 12 advisories but it appears as though the windows media player update was pulled since this was originally marked critical its not good that its pulled
3843964 its like a being given a treasure map thats half completed theres still a lot of space to cover but its significantly smaller than if you had no insight at all
3843965 also four of the 12 advisories had vulnerabilities that had already been publicly disclosed and one half of those publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are already being actively exploited

3843975 it went largely unnoticed in the united states at the time that our government was essentially proposing that the u s pledge itself through nato to defend the small country by all means necessary despite georgias strategic isolation outstanding separatist issues and tense relations with russia
3843976 the current situation reveals two things how little the united states is able or willing to do in the region in the face of a determined show of force by russia and how such displays of friendship and support by the united states can lead smaller countries to unwisely poke the russian bear which is essentially what the georgian government did

3844012 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
3844013 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3844014 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3844015 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3844016 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
3844017 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
3844018 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3844019 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think lee harvey oswald is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a conspiracy theory
3844020 ive seen the theories that he was a pawn like lee harvey oswald thats going to be hard to disprove
3844021 how do you disprove that a dead man was not a puppet being manipulated by the cia youre talking about proving a negative you cant prove aliens didnt mail the letters
3844022 hes a young player that we have been tracking for some time
3844023 its going to slowly pick up and i think it is picking up now
3844024 the markets are never down forever they are more up than down
3844025 this area probably isnt affected very much but i saw two people from auckland yesterday morning and they say it is dreadful up there every second person was a property developer and that is not in vogue at the moment
3844026 in that region we see two cholera seasons per year with peaks in spring and fall
3844027 are those mild cases infecting other people what are the immunological consequences how long are people with mild infections protected against re infection
3844028 our analysis showed that the best explanation for the patterns seen in the data is that many more people are being exposed to the bacteria than are getting serious infections or dying and that individuals with mild infections are losing their immunity quite quickly in a matter of weeks or months
3844029 in order to understand how to control this disease we really need to understand whats going on in the bulk of cases not just whats happening in the most severe
3844030 your conscious mind might tell you to vote for obama but in the privacy of the election booth your unconscious biases may vote differently
3844031 it remains to be seen but cautiously i think america is ready
3844032 extensive amounts of research have demonstrated the prevalence of stereotyping prejudice and discrimination but where others saw mere statistics trish saw an opportunity the premise upon which much of her research is based is that people desire to be good
3844033 in her personality lectures and research trish consistently conveys this message of optimism
3844034 i felt like i was this lone voice in the field saying you can trust what people say about their values but everybody was incredibly suspicious there was this clarion call to not trust peoples verbal reports because they are going to lie because it is socially acceptable to be non prejudiced i thought that was incredibly cynical
3844035 it turns out that the work i was doing changed the direction of the field it caused people to step up and take notice
3844036 prejudice is the legacy of our socialization experiences we all learn these stereotypes and have these biases at the ready whether we condone them or not whether we think they are good or not and as a result the immediate reaction is a biased one
3844037 if you are going to respond in nonbiased ways you have to gain control or override the automatically activated stereotypic response and instead respond in these thoughtful deliberate ways that might represent your personal values
3844038 it is almost impossible not to bump into devines research be it an introductory psychology textbook or in other researchers scholarly publications
3844039 whats most remarkable is that devines groundbreaking work of the late 1980s and early 1990s has stood the test of time the findings have been repeatedly replicated and they have served as a mighty catalyst for further investigation
3844040 eliminating prejudice is a process making that decision is the first step but then what you have to do is put some effort into it
3844041 just making the decision doesnt mean you wake up one day stretch and say im not prejudiced because you have got this whole socialization experience that you grew up with
3844042 when peoples values conflicted what i predicted is that if they were sincere in their non prejudicial beliefs they would feel guilty and self critical and they would hold themselves accountable
3844043 when given a chance low prejudice people tried to learn from mistakes tried to absorb material and at the next opportunity when prejudice was possible they responded in a fair and unbiased way
3844044 high internal high external individuals are not good at responding without bias so what they need is help learning to respond without bias they already have the motivation we need to give them the skills
3844045 for the high external individuals we need to create internal motivation that is what will rid them of prejudice over time
3844046 the low internal high external individuals on a campus like this receive a lot of pressure and not in a gentle way people say the way you think is wrong and people who like you are stupid you start to get irritated and you push the message away
3844047 that is one of the things i worry about backlash the harder non prejudiced norms are pushed on them the more they cement their walls of resistance for such individuals reducing prejudice requires finding ways to crack those walls of resistance
3844048 i couldnt have expected this puzzle because it is an ever evolving process i started with a set of ideas and did the best to test them but the results often challenge me and made me go in new directions
3844049 the end of the puzzle will only really be when we understand why people are prejudiced and when people learn to rid themselves of prejudice
3844050 all law is legislated morality the only question is whose morality because all morality is based on faith there is no such thing as religious neutrality in law or morality
3844051 the court can find no principled basis upon which to find that or even fully consider whether the new display is constitutionally impermissible

3844058 theres some very real questions that need to be answered
3844059 but the question is how do you get there and to have a finite timeframe like that theres a lot of work that has to be done and a lot of questions that need to be answered its a good idea good to have a goal but we need to do some practical work here before we can say its doable
3844060 the practical issues for us is whats the technology going to look like
3844061 and whos going to be around to apply it we have to put training programs in place to provide the industry with a substantial number of individuals who have expertise in this area so its not like we can go out and hire people or find the product today so theres a development time here a development of people material and application processes

3844078 this area probably isnt affected very much but i saw two people from auckland yesterday morning and they say it is dreadful up there every second person was a property developer and that is not in vogue at the moment
3844079 there is some evidence to suggest that property values around the world are coming under pressure
3844080 most people are expecting a fall of around 10 per cent
3844081 asbs profit result is pleasing in an economy which while slowing and undergoing change remains fundamentally sound
3844082 home lending activity has declined sharply this calendar year although asb has experienced less of a fall in volumes than the market
3844083 we are really investing in the business for the future
3844084 there will be a higher loss ratio in that lending but that is covered by the increased price
3844085 i see it as a reasonable market to operate in
3844086 it will tick over at a reasonable level of activity certainly not the heady activity that we have enjoyed in the last seven years but that had to slow down
3844087 so i think we are back to a more stable market i am confident that we can continue to grow the business perhaps slightly above the market

3844125 while voip services are being embraced by consumers worldwide businesses have been comparatively slower in their adoption due to various roadblocks this is about to change though as technical issues are resolved for example many pbx manufacturers have already added sip trunking interfaces to their equipment and more recently theyve greatly expanded the list of certified service providers and thats going to fuel the growth in sip trunking services these kinds of developments will boost the overall voip business services segment for years to come
3844126 this expansion will introduce mobile phone services to remote and war torn areas which lag far behind in the nations reconstruction efforts and for which telecom services are vital
3844127 it will give people in remote areas better access to markets access to information and will support families and communities that are often fragmented it will also be a great boost for the private sector by helping businesses access new parts of the country

3844232 if you are a patient and have allergy problems and suffering if you check the pollen count and its very high then you need to plan ahead

3844237 after years of violence we finally realized that al qaeda was only here to destroy our city
3844238 the relationship between the sos and isf in samarra is the best in all of iraq
3844239 from the beginning the americans were very serious about it
3844240 with all due respect to the coalition forces it was the sahwa movement that brought the most security to the city today is the safest samarra has been since al qaeda arrived in 2004
3844241 please pass along a message to your government from me tell them to do everything they can to get my boys hired into the iraqi security forces if they dont get hired they will go back to being jobless and we go back to the starting point

3844265 the only mention of school patrons who are after all the providers of education in the entire document is in this brief paragraph which seems to relegate them to the past and seems to consign their role in school ownership to history
3844266 there seems to be a policy assumption in the department of education that every new school at second level should be multi denominational
3844267 i would ask young men and women to consider the religious life and priesthood as a vocation option

3844283 rooted in the quite different moral and spiritual vision deriving from the bible

3844285 theocracies like those islam produces always produce command economies by their nature

3844288 best buy may well make no profit on the phone itself and even if it does its markup will amount to 50 or less mr mcgranahan says this is nonetheless a good deal for best buy because it will be able to sell 50 to 100 in very high margin accessories with each phone moreover it can attract customers to its stores with a semi exclusive arrangement mr mcgranahan said best buy wouldnt give him any information on its deal so this is all inference based on his understanding of the economics when i called best buy a spokesman wouldnt comment on its arrangement with apple and at amp t heres how mr mcgranahan works through his numbers relying in part on information from other bernstein analysts the wholesale price of the base model iphone according to bernsteins estimates is 550 when at amp t sells the phone for 199 it plans to make up the 350 subsidy from the monthly voice and data fees when apple sells that model bernstein estimates it receives a 450 subsidy from at amp t for best buy however the deal would not be as good mr mcgranahan figured if it paid a 550 wholesale price for an iphone that it then sells for 199 it may only receive 350 to 400 back from at amp t leaving it with a 0 to 50 profit on another smart phone with a price to consumers of 199 mr mcgranahan estimated the profit could easily be 100 to 200

3844303 doctors dont want patients to suffer they want people to get better
3844304 but they feel stress they feel time constraints they have to deal with pre authorizations its not the kind of practice they wanted theyre stressed and that leads to moving patients along
3844305 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3844306 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that
3844307 the patient needs to realize that the doctor may not be able to discern whats going on in the first visit often it takes a few visits
3844308 if you say its really depressing and upsetting me im in so much pain
3844309 doctors will see it in terms of emotion and treat it as an emotional problem referring you to psychiatric care or antidepressants
3844310 patients really need to be persistent about their complaints in a way that is constructive to get across to the physician that this is something real
3844311 there are some physicians who are more open to listening than others it may take a few doctors to find a marriage
3844312 this should send a strong warning to those who would undermine market integrity and undercut investor confidence for their own personal gain
3844313 adrenalin is the best painkiller and the crowd could see i was struggling and really got behind me they were fantastic
3844314 its just the drive that got me through i suppose
3844315 ive trained for so many years for this my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3844316 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3844317 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3844318 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3844319 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3844320 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3844321 my time was pretty average i have had a lot of experience at 200 of going out too fast and struggling at the end at the worlds i went off ridiculously fast and got smashed on the last 50 but i have learned from my mistakes
3844322 i have an absolutely wonderful wedding planner whos stopping me from being a bridezilla
3844323 im so excited its great its going to be a january wedding a lot of red white and silver and cranberries
3844324 he helped me pick the flowers most guys dont do that
3844325 hes great surprisingly hes been there every step of the way when ive needed him he is perfect
3844326 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
3844327 he never ends things with a clean slate he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
3844328 one of the biggest speculative endeavors was the hunt for whale oil
3844329 one thing that killed it off was the gold rush the same kind of guy that goes out to sea for two year was lured into the gold rush
3844330 it really has nothing to do with the underlying facts and figures
3844331 its the gambling nature of certain capital coupled with the frustration of nothing else working
3844332 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3844333 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3844334 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3844335 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3844336 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3844337 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3844338 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3844339 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3844340 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3844341 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3844342 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3844343 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3844344 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3844345 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3844346 im very optimistic about the fact that a year from now or a year and a half from now the market will be very high
3844347 in 1998 and 1999 stocks were really down but the companies then were not really full of assets now the boxes are full
3844348 we just launched a brand new quiz system with the latest build complete with a new look more quizzes to take and custom made user signatures imran
3844349 the board of directors is continuing to assess strategic alternatives for the company
3844350 our focus during the quarter has been on the divestiture of ifires assets at the same time we have been considering all possible options for the longer term structure of the corporate organization moving forward
3844351 with due skill care and diligence and failing to organize and control their business effectively
3844352 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
3844353 it is imperative particularly in more challenging financial conditions that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks
3844354 in light of ongoing challenging capital markets mgi implemented cost reduction initiatives and decreased its capital market activities and operations during the quarter
3844355 as a result mgi incurred approximately 700 000 of non recurring expenses of which 600 000 related to compensation and benefits
3844356 you could mine this stuff with teaspoons and still make money
3844357 from the point of view of the world we will be desperately short of this stuff if cigar lake doesnt come on stream
3844358 i think if cigar lake were to be delayed what cameco lost on sales volumes it would more than make up on higher prices
3844359 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3844360 weve got a good sized rally but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3844361 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there
3844362 i dont think people are going to change their commuting habits that fast
3844363 when we argue in an evidentialist way we overlook the inner authority of the scripture and seek to support it with an external authority truth is made dependent on something outside the authority of the bible we judge the bible by bringing it under a discipline reason science experience or some other field of study we must do the opposite bring all the disciplines under the word of god under gods narrative from beginning to end
3844364 there is no narrative that begins to compare with the christian narrative in which god enters our suffering to deliver us from sin and death and to deliver the world from the domain of darkness

3844382 weve tried to put together a committed honest and hard working team allied with the talent that was on show tonight
3844383 weve got a genuine bunch here and were all growing together but this is one win and were now concentrating on gillingham on saturday which is already a massive game for us
3844384 to be let down in the first half like we were is unthinkable
3844385 im an honest manager and all i ask is for the players to wear their hearts on the sleeve we had hundreds of fans come to see us tonight and the least they deserved is to see that
3844386 it was one of those nights where we thought we were going to be the top team and that we were going to do this and that but we didnt come to the show
3844387 i wish i hadnt made those changes now there are now a few question marks against a few players and only they can answer them

3844437 that is why this is so disappointing and frustrating im proud to be part of this team and proud of how we played but to make it mean something you have to get the results
3844438 plenty of these guys will be in contention for the world cup and we dont want the mentality that we just want to do ok or just make it out of the group
3844439 we want to be a force and that way of thinking is something i believe has changed from the past

3844468 there are quite a number of things that need to be done and the 4 cents will not solve it what we need is duty free on fuel fishing gears spare parts and ships like foreign fishing vessels
3844469 right now we are paying 13 to 14 cents more for fuel than foreign vessels so the 4 cents is nonsense and the temporary measure of two to thee months is also nonsense
3844470 it doesnt even come to 2 per cent to addressing the many big problems faced by this industry
3844471 we have always maintained that bottling companies in fiji are very small companies and were disadvantaged because we dont have the support from the government to be able to bring in more revenue
3844472 resource owners are entitled to much more than what they are getting and they are not even getting a million dollars these resource owners receive about 25 000 to 50 000 when they should be getting twenty to forty times much more
3844473 they use our infrastructure import a lot of fuel into the country and we have to move their cargo to the lautoka or suva wharf and bring huge machines that run into millions of dollars our roads are being damaged as a result of these heavy vehicles driving night and day
3844474 if they are exploiting our natural resources for commercial gain a fair share must be paid
3844475 pensaba que iba a ganar que quer a ganar necesitaba estar centrado en mi blanco
3844476 the way we will convey our message is different because we will use church pastors to do that
3844477 this is not some sort of political rally where the party is trying to draw support but merely a message out to the people
3844478 i dont think that there should be any suspicion whatsoever on what the party will be doing at the conference because this is the only way we can reach out to the people in their numbers
3844479 the future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive
3844480 lifestyles filled with hd media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
3844481 dell welcomes the availability of intels xhci specification because it provides a single interface standard that will expedite the industry transition to next generation usb 3 0
3844482 this interface standard is important to ensure that our customers have interoperable usb 3 0 systems devices and software drivers
3844483 microsoft has developed driver support for the usb industry standard since its inception and is committed to supporting the latest hardware technologies on the windows platform
3844484 microsoft intends to deliver windows support for hardware that is compliant with the xhci specification this is a huge step forward in enabling the industry and our customers to easily connect superspeed usb devices to their pcs for exciting new functionality and usages
3844485 nec electronics has supported intels ehci specification for usb 2 0 and whci specification for wireless usb 1 0 and developed solutions based on both of these standards
3844486 nec electronics will now provide usb 3 0 solutions based on intels xhci specification to ensure interoperability of our solution with multiple products from various manufacturers as we have done for usb 2 0 nec electronics would like to lead the usb 3 0 market with our discrete usb 3 0 host controller
3844487 we realize that there are many small form factor boards in the market
3844488 but we believe the new nano 8044 stands out from the crowd it is an off the shelf solution that can readily address todays need for applications that require a much smaller board size than the existing mini itx form factors and it provides a truly fanless configuration
3844489 the intel atom tm processor provides a fanless compact solution that meets the requirements of the market segments portwell serves
3844490 we have taken advantage of this technology to furnish a product that reduces the size of the mini itx by half when you add in lvds panel support and longevity support for seven years the new nano 8044 is the perfect solution for any embedded application with panel display

3844495 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3844496 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3844497 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws

3844505 it is not in any way overturned or compromised by judge brimmers decision in wyoming today
3844506 what it does do is create two conflicting court decisions in different federal courts different states both issuing decisions with nationwide impact
3844507 in light of the potential harm the roadless rule poses to our national forests due to beetle infestation and forest fires

3844521 two of the pubs near oxford which c s lewis frequented were the trout and the six bells some of lewiss american readers had written him to inquire about his views on drinking alcoholic beverages his response to them was in no uncertain terms i have always in my books been concerned simply to put forward mere christianity and am no guide on these most regrettable interdenominational questions i do however most strongly object to the tyrannic and unscriptural insolence of anything that calls itself a church and makes teetotalism a condition of membership apart from the more serious objection that our lord himself turned water into wine and made wine the medium of the only rite he imposed on all his followers it is so provincial what i believe you people call small town dont they realize that christianity arose in the mediterranean world where then as now wine was as much a part of the normal diet as bread
3844522 we ida estimate that there are approximately 2 500 outdoor lighting codes in the u s alone some of them very well written and others that are not having federal research and recognition of light pollution would assist states and municipalities in having a solid baseline for future codes and revisions to current ones
3844523 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
3844524 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
3844525 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
3844526 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
3844527 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
3844528 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
3844529 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes

3844536 this fall caused plaintiff extensive personal injuries including injuries to both knees
3844537 in all reasonable medical probability plaintiff will need future surgery and other medical care
3844538 defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the conditions of the premises because defendant or its agents or employee attempted to clean up the substance but failed to adequately do so

3844540 i spent six weeks in vienna dealing with the austrian police who treated me not as a mother in shock and disbelief but as a vile creature who had the audacity to ask them to help me find my gay son
3844541 according to the police since my son was gay it was obvious that he was emotionally unstable and thus must have committed suicide
3844542 you see children many years ago there was this thing called the cold war
3844543 you see children many years ago there was this thing called the cold war

3844547 moodys scramble to lock barn door impeded by fleeing horses
3844548 the substantial increase in bank loans average share of total debt will reduce average recoveries for both loans and bonds loans have less junior debt below them which will serve as a drag on recovery rates
3844549 on average first lien senior secured bank loans the first in the pecking order for payment in default will recover just 68 per cent on the dollar versus 87 per cent historically moodys estimates
3844550 moodys said the picture could change if creditors were able to minimize the decline in issuers overall worth at the time of default by for example forcing distressed issuers into bankruptcy relatively soon after they hit financial trouble

3844554 a vulnerability has been discovered in bittorrent which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a users system

3844556 this consultation takes forward gowers review recommendation 36 which recommended matching penalties for online and physical copyright infringement by increasing sanctions for online infringements
3844557 several submissions have called for a change in the law to increase online infringement penalties to the levels of physical infringement
3844558 the intention and impact of physical and online infringement are the same crimes committed in the online and physical world should not be subject to different sentences increasing the penalties for online infringement will therefore make the law more coherent
3844559 our investigations concluded that introducing exceptional summary maxima fines would allow magistrates courts to deal effectively with copyright offences as they would be able to award fines that took account of the illegal profits made from such offences
3844560 this represents both the most rapid and most significant expense savings ever realized for the airlines standing well in excess of any historic precedent for demand weakness
3844561 the industry today is a significantly different one than that which gave us pause last march both in our equity and credit views

3844564 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
3844565 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3844566 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3844567 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3844568 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
3844569 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3844570 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3844571 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
3844572 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
3844573 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
3844574 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3844575 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3844576 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
3844577 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
3844578 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
3844579 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
3844580 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
3844581 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3844582 the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
3844583 if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys

3844590 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3844591 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3844592 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3844593 the typical summer slowdown has been exacerbated by renewed fear over credit the direction of the economy and home price depreciation along with the sudden about face in the oil price and hedge fund losses on unusual market patterns

3844596 the operating results are not in zells favor theyrenot so draconian as to remove the positive of the cablevisionsale so its a holding pattern
3844597 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
3844598 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
3844599 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
3844600 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
3844601 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
3844602 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
3844603 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
3844604 were not ever really with people cause were always traveling
3844605 and you get on the phone and theyre like my day is awful blah and youre like this is not what i need right now
3844606 this is hard but if they are nagging and annoying youre like go away
3844607 we are secret agents and our cover is that were a band
3844608 everyone knew it was going to be about spies and thats changed a little bit i guess cause in the course of the last two years the band has changed a little bit were going to be the jonas brothers going through life like going to school but still being the jonas brothers
3844609 i love ben stiller and we met him just recently
3844610 it was weird writing a song talking about a boy
3844611 we were like so this is what girls go through
3844612 this suggests that refiners are cutting back and that should bring gasoline and to a lesser extent distillates back up
3844613 the combination of the inventory decline and the war in georgia gave people the incentive to buy oil
3844614 it amazes me how little attention crude oil traders have paid to the conflict between russia and georgia a month ago crude would have shot up 5 or maybe even 10 per barrel if it looked like we might lose a million barrels per day of supply
3844615 you strip out the gasoline and theres not much growth in what consumers are buying
3844616 with the prices being down at the pump i think people are starting to drive a little bit more
3844617 i went and had a meeting with the foreign minister the foreign minister said i was welcome anytime very kind man very welcoming and he said i was his most welcome guest so theres a shocker
3844618 it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii
3844619 it has consistently been the experience that strengthening in one place leads to new places becoming pressure points
3844620 the increase in maritime people smuggling is already with us
3844621 is only deflecting migrant traffic into other modes of entry
3844622 gee why should i have a mote and drawbridges when interlopers are just going to swim my moats and try to get in that way i should just give up fill in the moat put down the drawbridges and let all my enemies invade my castle while i die
3844623 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
3844624 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3844625 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3844626 all of my passion is with sap they have an active support program by comparison it is three years since i heard from microsoft which i think sees me as just another profit center from the customer standpoint the perception now is that upgrading microsoft is more complex it seems to me that customers are getting more frustrated anyone who doesnt look into microsoft infrastructure as part of their upgrade evaluation is going to be in for a rude surprise
3844627 in one implementation upgrading microsoft requires going through 175 screens were finding that businessone is much quicker typically a day or less all of this adds up to a lower tco a typical power style user on businessone is paying 2 975 the equivalent microsoft offering will cost 3 800
3844628 there are always four ways to do things and its important to learn which scenario works best you have to put the time in to offer the customer the best solution
3844629 saps brand is really important it makes a difference but is backed by a competitive product
3844630 with comparable performance to gpus on the market at that time
3844631 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3844632 we no longer have any rooms with a free shuttle service i could have a room but i would have to take a taxi
3844633 its easy to recruit because a lot of developers here are creating software for mobile devices on java for example it should be a win win situation for them since device support for windows mobile is increasing
3844634 the isv program is open to all developers that have demonstrated worthy open source projects our goal is to help them expand their market
3844635 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan the precursor to actual membership might have been viewed as a green light by russia i urge nato to revisit the decision
3844636 the single most important thing is modified mandatory and enforceable reliability standards in the united states and we are working towards that in all of the provinces of canada
3844637 in ontario there s very little that has changed since the blackout because frankly we were already there
3844638 if we continue with our current centralized energy system we re vulnerable to power mishaps
3844639 new generation fastsuits may be a technological advantage for swimmers who wear them
3844640 this is similar conceptually to how engineers design cars for racing and how we can employ physics to compliment human performance i think we all are eager to see how the swimmers in beijing will utilize these suits to showcase their prowess and years of hard work and training
3844641 can actually prevent these infections and the cervical abnormalities that require more invasive interventions
3844642 the crux of it is that we know how to prevent cervical cancer
3844643 one of the key questions is whether this huge outlay of money for the vaccine is a better strategy than reaching out to the women who arent getting pap tests and follow ups
3844644 the cdc and fda checked out these reports very carefully
3844645 and weve done calculations for the number of cases reported and the number of cases that youd find in the general population and we have not found an increase
3844646 while the vaccine will improve the health of american women its real benefit is in the developing world and no matter what pap screening shouldnt be neglected thats still our best safety net
3844647 may sound frivolous but little else has proven effective for the men most affected by the epidemic
3844648 committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
3844649 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
3844650 a very easy population to fund its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
3844651 you could mine this stuff with teaspoons and still make money
3844652 from the point of view of the world we will be desperately short of this stuff if cigar lake doesn t come on stream
3844653 i think if cigar lake were to be delayed what cameco lost on sales volumes it would more than make up on higher prices
3844654 an inflow at this rate is disappointing but our remediation plan as approved by our joint venture partners recognized the risk and included specific actions to be taken at various levels of inflow
3844655 there s no doubt that refiners are making less gasoline
3844656 the demand is bad so why store a product that you re going to have trouble selling
3844657 we ve got a good sized rally but it still doesn t feel like it s sustainable we re not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3844658 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there
3844659 i don t think people are going to change their commuting habits that fast
3844660 edwards is running for president on moral values his wife has been diagnosed with cancer and yet this is a man that were going to trust of leading the free world thats why this is an issue
3844661 if you cant keep a promise to your family cant keep a promise to your wife youre having an affair youre lying about the affair repeatedly why should the american people trust you when you say youre not gonna lie to them why should we trust you
3844662 amanda if thats true you cant trust somebody who had an affair how can we trust john mccain to be president of the united states since he cheated by his own admission on his first wife he didnt keep his marital vows he didnt keep his pledge to his first family
3844663 who are you how many hit records do you have
3844664 back in college when me and my roommates would get hammered and rap along to victory id yell to no one in particular that this was one of the 10 greatest hip hop songs of all time while clutching a quart of mickeys ice in one hand and a half eaten totinos party pizza in the other well just so you know heres a partial list of other things i thought were pretty great back then drunk driving self immolation ramen noodles the wwf phishs billy breathes and the career prospects of florida gators qb jesse palmer a k a the guy who ended up on the bachelor
3844665 when you go to eat at a stuckeys family restaurant and one of the girls from dream is your server do you tip her 20 percent or just the standard 15
3844666 carlitos way rise to power is perhaps the finest direct to dvd prequel to a substandard brian de palma al pacino gangster flick that also stars mario van peebles and that guy who played maurice tt rodriguez in boogie nights to be released this decade or at least in the past five years
3844667 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
3844668 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
3844669 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
3844670 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince jimmy page to appear in the video for that god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
3844671 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
3844672 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver

3844674 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
3844675 this funding gives me the opportunity to explore the archives of the gulag stalins labour camp system a vast network of mines lumber complexes and factories all staffed by prisoners that spanned the empty expanses of the soviet unions far north and eastern siberia
3844676 we know that forced labour killed many thousands in the gulag but paradoxically there was a network of labour camp hospitals and infirmaries mostly staffed by prisoner doctors and nurses keeping at least some prisoners alive
3844677 many gulag survivors mention these havens of mercy but no one has yet told their story
3844678 through survivor memoirs and official archives we will reconstruct the world of the gulag infirmary and ask how places of healing could co exist with the mass mortality of stalins prison camps
3844679 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
3844680 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to

3844694 redefining certain forms of birth control as abortion is an unreasonable interpretation of basic contraception and family planning
3844695 over 98 percent of all american women will use contraceptives at some point in their lives assuring access to safe affordable and reliable forms of family planning is sound public policy
3844696 any of the various procedures including prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
3844697 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3844698 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
3844699 they asked us to write something down that wed done since then and i just put down you wouldnt believe me any way who would believe that pete levi would end up preaching the gospel of jesus christ singing the gospel traveling around trying to help people i went clear out of character
3844700 i was principal at shelbyville and i quit i spent the next three years rodeo ing nobody would believe it ive been in the restaurant business gods let me do anything i wanted and i always took credit for it
3844701 my biggest claim to fame is that in all the years ive been preaching ive never had to work at getting a sermon out every time i get ready to preach its always there
3844702 i prayed for the wrong thing i said how can i help you i thought id become a sunday school teacher drive the bus the next morning my voice had changed i started my musical ministry and ive been preaching ever since thats the kind of life that ive had im so fortunate
3844703 i dont sell them if somebody wants to give me a love offering fine but god gives it to me
3844704 im not in this to make money if i was i wouldnt be a preacher
3844705 after the second week as interim they offered me the job full time and ive been there going on six years
3844706 that was not my idea i never figured id be a minister i fought it you know that we dont always go along with what god thinks is best
3844707 for about five years i was making big money and i didnt want to stop i was making twice in a day what i make in a week now but i have fun
3844708 its to get the word of god to people to get them to be saved to get them to come forward to accept jesus christ to be baptized
3844709 heres a place that in a summer time will baptize over 90 people i cant imagine that and to be able to go down there and to use their facilities and baptize my children is great
3844710 when we do our baptisms its quiet on sunday because the kids havent come in yet and the congregation is there up on the dry land im standing there and my head deacons beside me and this little child comes out and this child really doesnt have any idea what a wonderful step theyre taking to be a part of that thats what its all about
3844711 it is a beautiful old church and other ministers can go in and use the facilities weve got a gigantic new building there the cafeteria a full sized gymnasium upstairs we have dormitories downstairs we have private rooms
3844712 it is the ideal camp i think because its fun there are physical activities theres mental activities spiritual activities if i spent the rest of my life preaching i would never be able to do in my life what they do in a week or in a summer
3844713 if you are so charitable as far as john graziano is concerned why did you form all these limited liability corporations after your sons accident
3844714 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3844715 i dont know how political it was i had a high profile case
3844716 i went through all the training i served honorably in my unit i used army provisions to try become a noncombatant and remain in the army as a medic or something but i still would be subject to going on combat missions as a medic
3844717 my whole thing is that i cant bring myself to shoot another person if people want to criticize me for that then im honored to be criticized because im not a killer
3844718 its that outside unattended payment that we wanted to protect inside our point of sales systems were as secure as they could be and we wanted to provide this same level of security at our points of sale outside
3844719 i think people have a presumption that when theyre paying for something its secure but i know the reality is that there is a lot that goes into keeping someones account information completely secure
3844720 we wanted to make sure our customers were secure even when they didnt know it
3844721 the seminal film of the brazilian new wave movement is as naturalistic and heart wrenchingly earnest as any vittorio de sica weepie
3844722 with its telling compositions subjective shots and atomized overexposed lighting barren lives now seems relentlessly subjective keyed to the unarticulated anger of a people aware of its exploitation yet politically too embryonic to consider revolt
3844723 every friday the 11 regional directors file a detailed report to political director mike duhaime with precise numbers such as how many voters were contacted in their states that week and how many county and precinct chairs were added then on saturday morning duhaime holds a conference call with the regional directors as well as with top rnc aides and the state directors a month ago mccains campaign made a combined 20 000 phone calls and door knocks
3844724 there is so much excitement for the obama warner feder ticket it really is making a difference in connecting with the voters
3844725 virginias 10th congressional district is ready for change and in july what we really saw was a door to door blitz in the field that highlights the enthusiasm gap between democrats and republicans ive said this before and ill say it again anyone who thinks this is just going to be a replay of 2006 is kidding themselves
3844726 joel had one that was a prequel dating back all the way to the earthquake in san francisco the one we talk about in the original
3844727 the whole thing i found interesting was that once you were a vampire you go back to that youthful state
3844728 the prequel was always going to follow david when he was mortal before he got sucked into the earthquake and got turned that was joels idea and i thought that was really cool but apparently joel was really busy warner bros was really busy and it didnt happen
3844729 no absolutely not lost boys was a massive part of my life it still is you cant crap on that and im not going to go out and do a cameo in a dvd release sequel why they never talked to joel schumacher in the past 15 years about doing a proper sequel if youre not going to embrace what youre coming from in its original state look it was hard enough for me to do young guns 2 which i ended up thinking because we were all better was a better film
3844730 you have a suspicious substance that was found in a hotel room in conjunction with person being a foreign national and we have a lot of questions and that is why we are assisting

3844742 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3844743 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3844744 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3844745 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3844746 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3844747 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3844748 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3844749 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3844750 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3844751 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3844752 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3844753 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3844754 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3844763 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3844764 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3844765 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3844766 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3844767 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3844768 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3844769 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3844770 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3844771 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there
3844772 the financial services authority has today fined the uk operations of credit suisse for breaching fsa principles 2 and 3 by failing to conduct their business with due skill care and diligence and failing to organise and control their business effectively

3844877 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or sea ports to conduct this mission
3844878 personally convey americas unwavering support for the government of georgia
3844879 the united states stands with the democratic government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3844880 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement to end this conflict
3844881 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3844882 had credible reports that russia is violating the cease fire agreement including as bush mentioned the bombing of vessels and the blocking of the port which were very concerned about

3844893 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3844894 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3844895 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3844896 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3844897 one year ago today barack obama accused our men and women in afghanistan of just air raiding villages and killing civilians in this countrys fight against radical islamic extremism
3844898 whether those words were a product of inexperience or just bad judgment they were not the kind of words we expect from any candidate for our nations highest office
3844899 now you have narco drug lords who are helping to finance the taliban so weve got to get the job done there in afghanistan and that requires us to have enough troops that we are not just air raiding villages and killing civilians which is causing enormous problems there
3844900 as of aug 1 the ap count shows that while militants killed 231 civilians in attacks in 2007 western forces killed 286 another 20 were killed in crossfire that cant be attributed to one party
3844901 instead of a real debate about how to move forward in afghanistan its clear that the republicans would rather launch tired and old attacks to distract people from their record of completely failing to finish the fight against the taliban and al qaeda
3844902 i was patted on my butt by a united states president and
3844903 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3844904 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3844905 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3844906 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3844907 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity
3844908 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3844909 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3844910 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react in a way russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3844911 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3844912 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3844913 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3844914 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3844915 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbor country its not a good idea

3844921 designed to secure both physical and virtual environments through a single management window such a solution helps security administrators rapidly implement policies software based access management is helping organizations protect their critical business assets and enabling them to focus key staff on strategic projects

3844983 the fact that the parasite actively uses a component of the host hemoglobin as a way to protect itself against the defenses of the host is an interesting facet of the biology of parasites we discovered that the two subspecies of t brucei that can infect humans both possess tbhphpr
3844984 as the receptor shows equal affinity for the human specific hpr hb complex and the hp hb complex in contrast to the analogous human receptor cd163 which cannot bind hpr hb we deduce that tbhphbr is a parasite specific entry site for hpr hb thus the hprhb complex could be coupled to toxins and used as a novel drug against the parasite targeting only the parasite and not the host

3845033 the challenges mhb faces will likely continue throughout 2008 and into 2009 as the local economy in southeastern michigan suffers from high unemployment declining real estate values and further softness in the auto industry the distressed economic environment in michigan continues to weigh heavily on general business activity we are not unique in our situation as many banks are experiencing similar stresses while our challenges are not due to defaulted residential loans they are primarily centered on 10 to 12 commercial loan relationship which all have commercial real estate as the underlying collateral with a lack of general economic activity it is proving to be very difficult to pursue traditional paths when working out of these problem loans we have taken steps to shore up collateral require more equity and collateral from our borrowers and look for avenues to sell problem loans where appropriate and are taking additional measures to ensure the bank is prepared if the economic stress continues

3845036 the state board of education is embarking on major initiatives that will impact students for years to come
3845037 for example it recently made changes to require the states colleges and universities to better prepare students to be the next generation of teachers updated state academic standards and improved state policies that address educational programs and services for students with disabilities

3845045 the new standards both advance the consumer focus in health care management and continue to raise the bar on organizational quality improvement efforts the standards reflect significant input and recommendations from policy and corporate leaders across the health care management stakeholder spectrum
3845046 uracs new disease management information therapy standards send an important message that high quality chronic care management requires a patient centered approach

3845062 we are looking forward to having the nursing program running simultaneously at two locations and plan to continue implementing similar solutions with additional hospitals throughout the country
3845063 in california its estimated that over 10 000 new registered nurses will be needed each year for the next six years
3845064 hospitals today are being proactive in searching for ways to efficiently meet the high demand for nurses and our program is the solution theyve been looking for
3845065 use of temporary nurses is no longer a stop gap measure but has become a way of life for many hospitals
3845066 orbis education provided us with a transparent solution to help educate the nurses our community needs
3845067 we now host a fully accredited nursing program on premise without having to manage recruit or administer anything

3845085 this funding gives me the opportunity to explore the archives of the gulag stalins labour camp system a vast network of mines lumber complexes and factories all staffed by prisoners that spanned the empty expanses of the soviet unions far north and eastern siberia
3845086 we know that forced labour killed many thousands in the gulag but paradoxically there was a network of labour camp hospitals and infirmaries mostly staffed by prisoner doctors and nurses keeping at least some prisoners alive
3845087 many gulag survivors mention these havens of mercy but no one has yet told their story
3845088 through survivor memoirs and official archives we will reconstruct the world of the gulag infirmary and ask how places of healing could co exist with the mass mortality of stalins prison camps
3845089 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3845090 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3845091 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3845092 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3845093 were doing our best to keep up with them and to best understand the situation its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3845094 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3845095 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3845096 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3845097 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3845098 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3845099 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3845100 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3845101 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3845102 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth
3845103 a platform for informing inspiring and rallying those who care deeply about the family to greater involvement in the moral cultural and political issues that threaten our nation
3845104 im still pro life and im still in favor of marriage as being between one man and one woman and i would like the next president who will select justices for the next supreme court to agree

3845108 soldiers should not have to worry about filing expense forms in a war zone
3845109 we had mutual respect for each other even as we both planned each others murder
3845110 the commander explained to us that we will not receive building permits in this place he said we needed to find another place outside the fence with water and electricity and freer movement we told him we would not leave for any price we have documents proving this is our land everything is recorded in tabu the land registry
3845111 the supreme court approved moving the fence from the green line into the territories it did not decide to move people i believe israel is a country that follows the rule of law and also takes into account international law
3845112 however we have been here since the 1950s since the jordanians time and they came only in 1982 why are they taken into account but we arent why do i have to spend an hour in my car and be checked at two roadblocks in order to go shopping in qalqilyah which is a 10 minute walk from my house so it will be more comfortable for them you dont want us here so please move the fence to the green line and well go back to being a neighborhood of qalqilyah
3845113 the possibility exists of offering the bedouin residents in arab a ramadin and arab abu farda a living arrangement at a site beyond the fence route
3845114 even if you believe there is a big difference between forced transfer and voluntary transfer the difference is minimal when those designated for expulsion are dependent on civil administration permits and permission for every little thing
3845115 you know that there are hardly any areas where the village residents are not subject to the mercy of the army and the civil administration in all these areas you have limited our clients rights and occasionally even prevented them from being exercised at all
3845116 the administration wishes to find a permanent fitting and quality housing solution for the residents and is working to do so through dialogue and with their consent yet it is committed to enforcing the planning and construction laws in the region
3845117 the master plan submitted to the field unit several years ago was reviewed and turned down for various planning and security reasons and the residents representative was notified
3845118 este frustrant pentru c a fi vrut s debutez n lig

3845120 the decision to authorise the shot was reasonable given the circumstances of the incident
3845121 the facts show that the incident occurred against the backdrop of severe hostilities in the area earlier in the day three idf israeli army soldiers had been killed in an attack
3845122 only in retrospect was it discovered that the suspicious figures were reuters cameramen wearing vests and that the object mounted on a tripod was a camera and not an anti tank missile or a tripod mounted mortar
3845123 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3845124 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3845125 the latest in a long line of cases clearing soldiers of deadly negligence

3845134 no one knows what impact its going to have 10 years down the road but were still going to need more oil and gas
3845135 were not talking about alternatives because we both support alternatives

3845149 all the agents were happy about the issue because it gives us hope that other people will catch on and decide that its ok to use more black girls its ok to have more than just one and she doesnt have to always be naomi

3845152 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3845153 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
3845154 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then

3845160 the level of care owed is dependent upon the class of the person present
3845161 the unwarrantable entry on land in the peaceable possession of another is a trespass
3845162 hn6 an invitee is a person who enters onto the property of another at the express or implied invitation of the property owner
3845163 invitees are limited to those persons who enter or remain on land upon an invitation which carries with it an implied representation assurance or understanding that reasonable care has been used to prepare the premises and make 9 them safe for their reception
3845164 phrased somewhat differently hn7 it may be said that a person is an invitee on the land of another if he enters by express or implied invitation his entry is connected with the owners business or with an activity the owner conducts or permits to be conducted on his land and there is a mutuality of benefit or 717 a benefit to the owner
3845165 because larimore who was hired by the property owner to add vinyl siding to his home was a business visitor invited to enter or remain on the property for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with the property owner larimore was an invitee
3845166 invitees include patrons of stores patients in a physicians 10 office persons visiting a filling station to use the restroom or vending machine or to ask directions and workmen invited to work on the premises
3845167 a public invitee is one who is invited to enter or remain on the land as a member of the public for a purpose for which the land is held open to the public
3845168 business visitors are considered invitees as long as their purpose for entering the property is either directly or indirectly connected with the purpose for which the property owner uses the land
3845169 a business visitor is a 718 person who is invited to enter or remain on land for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with business dealings with the possessor of the land
3845170 the class of persons qualifying as business visitors is not limited to those coming upon the land for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with the business conducted thereon by the possessor but includes as well those coming upon the land for a purpose connected with their own business which itself is directly or indirectly 12 connected with a purpose for which the possessor uses the land
3845171 includes persons who are invited to come upon the land for a purpose connected with the business for which the land is held open to the public as where a person enters a shop to make a purchase or to look at goods on display
3845172 the second class includes those who come upon land not open to the public for a purpose connected with business which the possessor conducts upon the land or for a purpose connected with their own business which is connected with any purpose business or otherwise for which 863 the possessor uses the land
3845173 thus a truck driver from a provision store who enters to deliver goods to a private residence is a business visitor and so is a workman who comes to make alterations or repairs on land used for residence purposes
3845174 it is sufficient that there is a reasonable generalized gamut of greater than ordinary dangers of injury and that the sustaining of the injury was within this range
3845175 an injured person has been held to 17 be a licensee where he entered premises to seek a favor to make inquiries or ask directions to do volunteer work to use recreational facilities without asking specific permission to recover an item of personal property left on the premises to obtain some article of value given to the licensee by the occupant or while chasing his dog
3845176 since a licensee is there for his own benefit he 18 can be said to accept the premises as they are and demand no greater safety than his host provides himself
3845177 is there for his own purpose rather than to benefit the owner occupier
3845178 where it can be found that the public employee comes for a purpose which has some connection with business transacted on the premises by the occupier he is almost invariably treated as an invitee
3845179 a public utility employee who comes upon premises for the purpose of reading a meter or checking installing or maintaining the utility equipment is generally accorded the status of an invitee and accordingly the person in occupation or control of the premises owes him a duty of exercising reasonable care to keep the premises reasonably safe for the contemplated 865 use
3845180 the contention that a meter reader is not specifically invited onto the premises and is therefore only a licensee has been rejected
3845181 hn18 public employees like water meter readers are generally regarded as invitees
3845182 because larimore the vinyl siding subcontractor installer was a business visitor invited to enter or remain on the property for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with the landowner larimore was an invitee
3845183 not disputed that wilson was as a business invitee entitled to at least a warning of any unsafe conditions of which the landowner knew or should have known 22 and of which the invitee was reasonably not aware
3845184 in actions for personal injury to meter readers or similar public service employees coming upon premises in connection with the utilities supplied thereto the courts have usually treated the employee as an invitee of the person responsible for the maintenance of the premises and accordingly have imposed the ordinary duty of a landowner to an invitee that is the exercise of reasonable care to keep the premises reasonably safe for the contemplated use or at least to warn of dangers not open and obvious
3845185 it has generally been held either expressly or impliedly that a garbage or trash man while performing services for the owner is an invitee to whom the duty of exercising reasonable and ordinary care is owed by the owner or occupant in the operation and maintenance of its place of business or premises to avoid injuring him but where he exceeds the scope of his invitation or performs an act which is not covered by his invitation recovery has been denied by the court
3845186 there is no merit in the contention that phillips was a mere licensee on the premises
3845187 the principle appears to be that invitation is to be inferred where there is a common interest or mutual advantage while a license is inferred where the object is the mere pleasure or comfort of the person using it
3845188 everything connected with the situation was open and obvious a warning by the defendant would not give the plaintiff more than he could learn at a glance
3845189 the appellant was not only an 33 invitee of the tenant but was an invitee of the landlord because it is clear from the evidence in this case that one of the reasons for his inspection and checking of the electrical meters located in the back room of the building owned by the appellees was to avoid and correct any situation that may have existed that would create a fire hazard to the building
3845190 was not only an invitee of the appellees but was there on the premises for the benefit of the appellees or landowner
3845191 those who come upon the land for a purpose which is connected with their own business which itself is directly or indirectly 35 connected with any purpose business or otherwise for which the possessor used the land
3845192 a business visitor is a person who is invited to enter or remain on land for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with business dealings with the possessor of the land
3845193 invitation of the owner or occupant is implied by law where the person goes on the premises for the benefit real or supposed of the owner or occupant or in a matter of mutual interest or in the usual course of business or for the performance of some duty and the owner or person in possession of the premises owes it as a duty to those 38 who come on the premises by invitation express or implied to 732 exercise 870 reasonable or ordinary care to keep and maintain his premises in safe condition
3845194 if the invitee goes outside of the area of his invitation he becomes a trespasser or a licensee depending upon whether he goes there without the consent of the possessor or with such consent
3845195 the question of whether plaintiff exceeded the scope of his invitation by going to the factory room to see about the box was one for the jury

3845198 when a doctor doesnt look an asian american patient in the eye that might be seen as but making eye contact is encouraged with black patients according to the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons which has published a guidebook for culturally competent care as the countrys ethnic profile diversifies some states are trying to assure that health care providers are trained in cultural competency new mexico passed a law last year requiring that higher education institutions with health education programs provide such training though the state still is grappling with how it will be implemented new jersey and california are among a handful of states with similar measures already in place

3845200 we thank the swiss government not only for the values of freedom and civil rights that are enshrined in its culture but also for its willingness to share in its experience of federalism through the institute of federalism located in fribourg in switzerland which has been helping us do our studies on this form of government we advocate federalism as a way to ensure long lasting peace in mindanao
3845201 we have made progress but we will need your support to get the job done for the fundamental change in our political system
3845202 our present form of government has many gridlocks which have become a hindrance to our socio economic growth
3845203 i said the search for peace must be constitutional but the constitution must serve the quest for peace and i believe that we have a better chance for lasting peace and development in mindanao if indeed we have a federal form of government
3845204 federalism is not merely a political form it will have substantive implications on the political economy of the nation therefore we must address the issue of economic viability and the preparedness of component states from our present situation as an archipelago the next transition is now to gear towards a wider distribution of economic zones such as those pioneered successfully right here in china then towards autonomy and then to statehood as for the shift to the parliamentary form of government it must be spearheaded i believe and again it must be spearheaded by meaningful political reforms particularly a law on political parties that would spur the rehabilitation of our societal organizations and mass movements and cleaning up of our electoral processes
3845205 ours is a country divided the story of our nation is a tale of two philippines almost as it were two countries under the same name
3845206 perhaps we politicians have done our best but maybe our best is not enough given the present system perhaps we have strained the present political system to its final limit it is time to turn to the people bring them into government and change the way that government is done
3845207 the economic progress and social stability of the provinces along with the increasing self reliance and efficiency of political developments and public services there make a compelling case for federalism perhaps its time to take the power from the center to the countryside that feeds it

3845215 electricity run trains in principle may mean more upfront costs but it will also depend on the net present value of the project
3845216 apparently context is everything so the united states attacking grenada or nicaragua or panama or iraq or serbia is justified even if the reasons sometimes dont hold water or dont hold up before the united nations the hague or other institutions of international law
3845217 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
3845218 he has been championed by the bush administration but he failed in his attempt to impose georgian control over south ossetia and has to pay a price
3845219 once again the west was taken by surprise the word in washington and london is that president saakashvili was warned to exercise restraint if so not only has russia come out on top against a potential western nato ally but that potential ally ignored serious advice from its mentors this raises the issue of what happens now
3845220 this has been a difficult conflict in which to sort out the facts russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities and did not allow reporters and international observers in to check them georgia made all kinds of claims that russia was invading including a statement that russian troops had taken over the town of gori which proved not to be so the us and uk at least have chosen to represent this as russian aggression yet it was georgia that attacked with a rocket barrage which by its nature was indiscriminate
3845221 the fact is that the west needs russia and russia needs the west russia wants or will want to be better integrated into the world economic system and to be taken seriously as a diplomatic partner
3845222 every great cause begins as a movement becomes a business and eventually degenerates into a racket
3845223 to preserving the southwest museum site located in mount washington and the casa de adobe site located in highland park as key components of the future of the center
3845224 we envision multiple uses for these extraordinary sites which would ensure their prominence in our city
3845225 would include among other items i facility reports which will analyze structure of facilities of southwest and autry existing as of the date hereof and ii plans relating to capital and endowment campaigns
3845226 steps to save the southwest museum building as well as its world renowned collection
3845227 a new facility for displaying and storing the southwest museum collection in griffith park to maximize access to the collection
3845228 to build a new facility adjacent to the existing autry museum to expand exhibition space and audience for programs relating to the southwest
3845229 this initial study presents prototype plans and operating models for a museum only use however at this time we do not believe that it is possible to operate the site exclusively as a museum as a result of these studies we would like to explore compatible and complementary uses operated by the center that would allow for the buildings to be rehabilitated as well as ensure their survival as public places we simply cannot allow these historic sites to languish
3845230 with the levin study as a benchmark the center is seeking a partnership with the community to generate creative alternatives that will fulfill the original mission of southwest founder charles lummis and ensure that the buildings continue to be a vital resource for all of los angeles criteria for assessing any alternative use of both the mount washington site and the casa de adobe are as follows 1 the use should be compatible with the autry national centers mission and in line with lummis belief that all of the cultures of the southwest need to be understood respected and appreciated 2 the use should preserve the historical importance and fabric of the buildings and the site 3 the use should be economically feasible over a sustained period of time economic feasibility at the southwest must be integrated into the planning of the autry national center as a whole 4 the use as a public destination should enhance the vitality of the surrounding community
3845231 we believe that appropriate and compatible uses for both the southwest museum site and casa de adobe site can be found we want you to know that there is no intention to dispose of these sites for commercial development we will work with the community and elected officials as part of any decision making process we ask that you join with us in the planning process become members of the center and actively support all efforts to continue the southwest museum and casa de adobes important roles in our city signed john l gray
3845232 i told bocog that theres no way the scouts could sit anywhere but there
3845233 i told them thats their office thats where they do their work they have to sit behind home plate they cant be down the lines
3845234 ive got a box where i locked them away so they dont have to bring them back and forth everyday i mean i guess you can see it president george w bush after all was here for a game and its tough these days to even travel through an airport with one of those things you cant even call it a radar gun you have to call it a pitching velocity detector or something
3845235 the atmosphere wasnt quite what we expected but when it gets down to playing international games you play a lot of them in that fashion
3845236 its easy to recruit because a lot of developers here are creating software for mobile devices on java for example it should be a win win situation for them since device support for windows mobile is increasing
3845237 the isv program is open to all developers that have demonstrated worthy open source projects our goal is to help them expand their market
3845238 they are dragging their feet in forcing these banks to reserve realistically some of these banks could have been closed two or three quarters earlier
3845239 in some of these cases i believe regulators should act sooner than later to prevent future losses to the fund
3845240 the failures so far this year will drain the fdics insurance fund by an estimated 9 2 billion
3845241 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3845242 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3845243 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3845244 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3845245 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3845246 we were actually the first major newspaper in the u s to start a podcast
3845247 we saw podcasts as a way to reach audiences we werent reaching with the print product
3845248 and audio as a way to supplement print stories in ways we in newspapers couldnt do before
3845249 one is a pre existing studio thats also used when one of our reporters or editors is asked to appear on radio it has an isdn line but we also attached a computer to the microphones and record that way as well our main podcast studio is equipped with shure studio microphones an alesis audio mixer and a macintosh g4 computer we record on garageband but edit using adobe audition 2 0 we also have several marantz digital recorders for reporters to use in the field
3845250 i started the podcast about a year ago as a way to capture the informal conversations i have with fellow critics and filmmakers and its been very well received
3845251 a flexibility that radio doesnt provide the length of episodes can vary topics can be offbeat because theres no need to reach a mass audience and for some reason its more intimate listeners tell us they feel like a fly on the wall plus they can listen on the way home from work
3845252 a real time exchange of ideas two people in a room saying things that spark new thoughts this shows up in our interviews with filmmakers like guy maddin werner herzog thomas mccarthy mike white and david gordon green
3845253 theres an under served niche between the extremely academic cinephile sites and the promotional cheerleaders who are slaves to the publicity machine we hope to be a small but solid sliver in the middle
3845254 the show is very conversational and we dont try to come off as film critics but i think the show has better production values than most
3845255 means trying to find an interesting conversation to have each week its easy to just talk about whats in theaters that week but then were doing what everyone else is doing some of my favorite episodes have been when we walk in on monday and say something like i watched a herzog movie this weekend really i saw an amazing documentary on cable about china then these strange threads start to connect together and all of the sudden were watching wall e and talking about all three movies in a way we could never have guessed
3845256 and devote a significant amount of time to it but well also take time to really work through an art film we found at a festival or a youtube video we go into what a movie means to us and avoid being academic about it id hope our listeners wouldnt see us as experts as much as their favorite friends to watch movies with
3845257 we have a solid state field recorder that records sound directly to a compact flash card we download the files from the cf card onto a mac and edit with final cut pro kevin and i both have a video background so its more comfortable for us to use fcp the edited mp3 file is uploaded in a blog post to blog spout com using podpress a podcasting plugin for wordpress the blogging platform the xml feed from those posts is pulled into itunes and other podcast libraries
3845258 when we started doing the audio visual conference we so enjoyed having people talk with us
3845259 we have a lot of male listeners and we encourage men to interact
3845260 what we liked most about characters or the plot and how we identified with it we can often get into the emotional aspect of a movie where a lot of reviewers wont venture near it
3845261 the people of long island city desperately needed a food store
3845262 tonight should be terrific when people come home from work
3845263 theres still a great deal of strength in terms of the number of tourists who are coming to san francisco and in particular passengers who are coming through san francisco international airport
3845264 however were not seeing the same kind of growth in the hotel daily rates and in the average hotel occupancy in fact our hotel occupancy has actually slipped from may of this year as compared to may of last year
3845265 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl

3845279 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage
3845280 they did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts
3845281 they looked very happy the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3845282 i felt much more attracted to women and just felt like a man but i knew i was not lesbian
3845283 but the states leaders have failed to act therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3845284 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3845285 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3845286 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3845287 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3845288 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3845289 i cannot write anything today i think i wont write anything at all
3845290 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort
3845291 at home the husband is the master and the wife is out of doors
3845292 this is rabid anti gm misguidedly demonising gm results in the real issues being sidelined creating the very problems that prince charles is trying to address
3845293 there are several issues that have been muddled together resulting in serious dangers to the future direction of agriculture
3845294 he has confused the dominance of multinational companies and its consequences for food security with the use gm in agriculture if there were a total world ban on gm tomorrow it would have no effect at all on the dominance on big multinational companies
3845295 prince charles like many wealthy people has no concept of the hardships of other parts of the world he wants to retain his vision of a rural idyll by telling the poor to eat organic cake while he pours wine into the fuel tank of his sports car
3845296 he is using the privileged position of a prince of the realm to try to influence us with a one sided irresponsible view of food technology he is like a romantic 19th century poet writing and painting pictures of rural life
3845297 environmentalists have been saying for years all we need to do is redistribute wealth to feed the poor it has not happened so we have to produce more food the most effective way is through gm crops
3845298 i was shocked and saddened to read what prince charles said shocked because it was so ill informed one sided and generally negative
3845299 saddened because the prince is in a position to lead this country in solving some of the massive problems he identifies he could bring together our world class scientists and agricultural experts to catalyse constructive debate and action that would benefit the uk and the rest of the planet
3845300 instead he indulges in diatribes in which he appears to blame the problems of the planet on a single technological advance that he has completely misunderstood
3845301 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3845302 food security is an important issue we do need to evaluate a range of techniques and technologies which have been proposed for enhancing food crop production and the royal society is currently undertaking a study looking at this
3845303 if we go down this path i think we will put this country at risk there could be a period of great difficulty in the next 10 or 20 years
3845304 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3845305 prince charles has got a way of getting things absolutely wrong its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them out of hand
3845306 temperatures of up to around 20 c 68 f and a damp turf surface are all red thread needs to establish itself
3845307 sports fields simply cant be out of action so groundsmen learn to be incredibly vigilant and spray before it can take hold
3845308 for private gardeners who really prize their lawns it can be very frustrating its not terminal but it looks very unsightly
3845309 theres really not much they can do just wait for the weather to turn at this rate and knowing the british weather they may be waiting some time
3845310 we are now seeing a much stronger strain that creates footprint shaped damaged patches on the lawn
3845311 if closely inspected you will see a fine red needle coming off the leaf that attaches itself to the blade of grass
3845312 there are no signs of any prolonged spell of settled weather just yet
3845313 although it may seem it with the rain weve had recently the weather this year really hasnt been that unusual and rainfall totals are not out of the ordinary
3845314 its not as bad as it could be temperatures have been about half a degree above average and sunshine hours have been average
3845315 any theory that tries to explain quantum entanglement will need to be very spooky spookier perhaps than quantum mechanics itself
3845316 we try to be cautious and not excite too much premature enthusiasm among people suffering from diseases such as hepatitis c and hiv aids
3845317 in general metamaterials can be designed for many interesting applications beyond this work such as slow light in optical communications
3845318 our work at this point is concentrated on manipulating light beams at a small scale and bending them at our desire which enables technologies for imaging at molecular scale and building even smaller computer circuits
3845319 i am excited about the realization of the material by the berkeley team since this is precisely the kind of material with very much the right properties that we have assumed in our earlier work
3845320 theres a huge amount of research now showing people have a preference for attractive people from birth to death
3845321 babies prefer attractive faces and adults treat attractive babies better
3845322 our happiness levels seem to be pre set in life
3845323 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3845324 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3845325 we were appealing to everybody in the international community including russia saying stop that unfortunately no help came
3845326 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3845327 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
3845328 sometimes i have feared that in some wild paroxysm of rage the white race forgetful of the claims of humanity and the precepts of the christian religion will proceed to slaughter the negro in wholesale as some of that race have attempted to slaughter chinamen and as it has been done in detail in some districts of the southern states
3845329 how well we do will determine if we practice this afternoon
3845330 today as they confront new competition on the web television networks are increasingly embracing portable and inexpensive methods of production
3845331 nbc abc and cbs now pool most of their international resources in london and deploy reporters to other countries as needed
3845332 but a new breed of reporter sometimes called a one man band has become the new norm though the style of reporting has existed for years it is being adopted more widely as these reporters act as their own producer cameraman and editor and sometimes even transmit live video
3845333 three camera crews three producers two correspondents drivers and a chef in a house with a view of the eiffel tower
3845334 no one epitomizes the street food ethos quite like the tamale lady
3845335 xul and the desktop paradigm for extension development has a high cost of adoption
3845336 linux is only free if the value of my time is zero
3845337 we are proud to be one of prime buyers top 10 companies we feel it is extremely important to have independent sources such as prime buyers report to evaluate new growing industries like renewable energy
3845338 weve experienced tremendous growth in the last year and im thrilled we have assembled a world class team to capitalize on our market position
3845339 the depth and diversity of experience of our leadership team is a huge asset and will help take our business to the next level
3845340 to help americans use our health care resources more effectively providers must communicate clearly to their patients including the nearly one in two adults with low reading skills
3845341 instead of using medical speak we need to write medical materials at the 3rd to 5th grade reading level
3845342 i see him all the time at least once a week
3845343 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3845344 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3845345 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
3845346 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3845347 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3845348 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3845349 give it some time its new besides opera is so much better than ff or safari in so many ways thats just my opinion of course

3845369 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington
3845370 do you think you might be able to contact karl as i am sure you have more weight there
3845371 talked to rove about this and i think i killed it hes on it keep this between us dont want to raise expectations but i banged on this one hard
3845372 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
3845373 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
3845374 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
3845375 we have already stressed to him that his citizenship is of the utmost importance he understands that anything less than exemplary behavior will not be tolerated

3845377 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child
3845378 what we are waiting to hear is that he sees this as a moral issue
3845379 i spent six weeks in vienna dealing with the austrian police who treated me not as a mother in shock and disbelief but as a vile creature who had the audacity to ask them to help me find my gay son
3845380 according to the police since my son was gay it was obvious that he was emotionally unstable and thus must have committed suicide
3845381 that he probably killed himself because he was hiv positive or had aids
3845382 austrian law enforcement was not required to take missing persons reports on non citizens
3845383 i made this rule for myself that i wasnt going to cry during the day
3845384 when i would wake up there would be this repeating video loop of wheres aeryn
3845385 i want the truth and i dont think ill ever have that
3845386 i want my son home i just want to bring my son home
3845387 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
3845388 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3845389 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3845390 my most immediate task is to get us in the right financial position to take advantage of the sales pipeline and opportunities ahead
3845391 with strong support from key existing shareholders we believe we are close to securing the additional financing that will provide identiphi the capital for longer term stability and put us on the road toward profitability
3845392 declines in real estate values in pinnacles lending area began in the second half of 2007 and continued in the first and second quarters of 2008
3845393 challenging market conditions particularly those affecting small and micro cap companies have resulted in a sharp decline in the number of initial public offerings ipos and private equity transactions taking place
3845394 during the first six months of 2007 there were 147 ipos completed in the u s markets while only 42 have been completed in 2008 thus far whats more 56 companies have canceled planned ipos since the first of this year as a consequence investment banking firms nationwide have suffered and our company is no exception

3845404 it sends a message that you did the right thing
3845405 the fed is going to act and is going to establish a new baseline for consumer protection that everyone will follow
3845406 we hope they will consider the impact this will have on pricing in the marketplace and the big question of whether or not low risk consumers are going to have to subsidize people who pose a higher risk
3845407 weve got to take some strong action the feds action is a small step in the right direction but we take several steps that are needed

3845415 people will summarize your life in one sentence pick it now
3845416 it is never too early to think about the kind of long term impact youll have on your organization is it ever too early to think about what people will think say or do after your tenure as a leader has ended as a result of having worked with you we think the answer to both questions is no in fact we believe that the earlier leaders begin to consider their leadership legacy the better leaders they will be
3845417 legacy is organizing the way you live your life so that you will be a blessing to other people for generations to come living without a legacy perspective is like watching a high definition hd television without a high definition television set not only will it be blurry but you will also miss the layered brilliance of the whole experience
3845418 legacy is a desire with instructions flowing with inspiration from god through your imagination and compelling you to leave an impartation beyond your lifetime
3845419 everything about you matters every trial test and triumph is not just personal but generational with eternal consequences

3845457 the restraining order even if modified remains an improper prior restraint restricting speech
3845458 the first amendment does not allow people to be silenced because their speech exposes flaws even if those flaws might someday be illegally misused by others to protect our clients rights we had no choice but to ask the court to reconsider the gag order

3845478 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3845479 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3845480 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3845481 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3845482 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3845483 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3845484 apple inc nasdaq aapl formerly apple computer inc is an american multinational corporation with a focus on designing and manufacturing consumer electronics and closely related software 2125
3845485 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3845486 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3845487 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3845488 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3845489 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3845490 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3845491 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3845492 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3845493 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3845494 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3845495 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3845496 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3845497 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3845498 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3845499 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3845500 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3845501 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3845502 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3845503 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3845504 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3845505 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3845506 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3845507 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3845508 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3845509 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3845510 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3845511 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3845512 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3845513 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3845514 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3845515 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3845516 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3845517 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3845518 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3845519 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3845520 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3845521 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3845522 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3845523 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3845524 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3845525 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3845526 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3845527 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3845528 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3845529 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3845530 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3845531 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3845532 anjis sweet sweet sweet sweet voice i remember the first time i ever heard her way back in the day i said she could read me a chinese menu or the phone book and i would be all happy
3845533 anjis voice wouldnt be out of place in a smoky jazz or blues bar somewhere down in a dimly lit cellar sultry with a voice like syrupy silky satin with a marshmallow middle and a honey topping
3845534 cosiness abounds as the silken voiced anji bee lead singer of chillout band lovespirals pours a cocktail of mellow dance music mmm
3845535 if youre looking for a different brand of grown and sexy in the podcast world check out anji bee this young lady is bringing it from production to her voice to the music selection she is doing her thazizzle
3845536 no other voice in the podosphere is more sultry than anji bee
3845537 enjoying the chillcast its seriously awesome i listen to them like over and over again
3845538 i just love the tunes anji bee selects and her comments on them i no longer have to search for music to be creative i just susbcribe to the chillcast
3845539 like having a cocktail of lovely tunes and honey poured directly into your ear well chosen music voice links that make you feel cosy inside it all adds up to an essential weekly download
3845540 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3845541 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3845542 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3845543 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3845544 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3845545 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3845546 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3845547 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3845548 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3845549 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3845550 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3845551 how can they eat on vacation something theyd have as a pet at home

3845566 i dont want to go down in history as a man who allowed blood to be shed i couldnt stand the idea of bloodshed casualties
3845567 you know to address crowds and make promises does not require very much brains i believe politicians should always remain realistic
3845568 we are optimistic that this is going to go through because they are talking about the budget year they are in right now so we are seeing all that work starting to happen
3845569 i believe the traffic flow not only through the city but the bypass will be a lot safer
3845570 so it is going to be a lot safer to travel through the city of fort madison
3845571 it just turns you into a really suspicious person and it is consuming its consuming knowing someone is out there
3845572 we are going to attempt to connect the evidence from the robberies at tonys old place with the one from the abbey this morning
3845573 the similarities would be the way of entry in both cases the robbers broke a back window also the items taken from the restaurants are very similar
3845574 lets get an early start this morning more things can be done that way
3845575 really as in i have nothing to worry about even though i am in pain
3845576 why do you love me answer then send to 12ppl
3845577 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3845578 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3845579 thanks i have to i love playing with my band its the music thats all there is

3845669 end stage pulmonary sarcoidosis usually develops over one or two decades
3845670 ive had sarcoidosis since 1983 and it has not altered or limited my lifestyle no one knows where sarcoidosis comes from or where it starts and theres no known cause for this condition that affects primarily minorities
3845671 had double pneumonia which weakened his lungs and his entire immune system and the sarcoidosis symptoms became pronounced
3845672 i still walk play basketball and do normal things since sarcoidosis hasnt slowed me down then it shouldnt be a concern for others
3845673 bernie mac didnt have to die pervasive misconceptions about sarcoidosis
3845674 gets the patient back on his feet so he can walk all the way to the autopsy table
3845675 mac also suffered from sarcoidosis an inflammatory lung disease but he had said the condition went into remission in 2005
3845676 if you look at the patients doing the mp for sarcoidosis nearly all of them are not african american showing that a lot of people of other races get the disease
3845677 i have done hundreds of hours of research on the internet read many many studies and looked for something negative about the mp i couldnt find anything negative except that it hasnt had a double blind study
3845678 one thing is for sure if bernie mac had been treated with the marshall protocol he would be alive and well today
3845679 bernie was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
3845680 i think they did it issue an arrest warrant to pretty much scare us from coming back i went and had a meeting with the foreign minister and he said i was welcome anytime very kind man very welcoming and he said i was his most welcome guest so theres a shocker

3845708 i couldnt see my son he was engulfed by the bear the kid was in the fetal position on the ground and there was nothing in the world that was going to stop me from getting that bear off him

3845715 me and my dad were throwing sticks and stones and whatever we could find to keep it away from us we were yelling evan evan where are you we couldnt find him
3845716 the bear looked like he wanted to come back for more

3845736 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth

3845746 what is my daughter most excited about what captures her imagination what are her desires and dreams for her future is she more eager to be with friends than to be with family would she rather pursue activities outside of the home rather than endeavors in the home who does she admire more faithful homemakers or worldly women
3845747 its the kind of summer comedy that rolls in makes a lot of people laugh and rolls on to video its been a good summer for that
3845748 fun impaired critics who complained that last weeks pineapple express went over the top ought to get a load of this weeks r rated laugh riot tropic thunder mount everest would look like a speck from this ones extreme altitude which is exactly how it should be ben stillers latest sends up all things overblown about hollywood and the perfect volume setting for this kind of satire is 11
3845749 simultaneously smart and dumb mixing clever satire with way over the top raunch and unrelenting profanity
3845750 there are some wildly funny scenes a few leaden ones and others that are scattershot with humorous satire undercut by over the top grisliness still when its funny its really funny
3845751 all over the place but its hard to get too tough on a hollywood satire that in the end loves hollywood so much that its just not going to take any prisoners
3845752 tropic thunder is an assault in the guise of a comedy
3845753 watching it is like getting mugged by a clown sure by my bruised reckoning there are a few chuckles here but youll definitely pay a price for them
3845754 in the end tropic thunder is an expensive goof about an expensive goof and the results are very impressive and fancy looking too impressive really to fully unleash the humor in the situations
3845755 possible to bring back actors from the past and realistically put them in new films
3845756 so id really like it if i could say this
3845757 our job is not to support a lawyers theory its to find out the technical truth
3845758 this is one of our major pet peeves about working with attorneys
3845759 if were brought in early enough to a case we can establish the technical facts very well and lawyers can use that to guide their strategy the legal strategy that you can start off on given all the facts is usually just as beneficial and of course much more tenable than the legal strategies that you would embark on without all the technical facts
3845760 waiting until the discovery deadline may force the attorney into hiring an expert who just gives an opinion that the attorney wants to hear and not necessarily bound by the constraints of mother nature
3845761 at time of deposition or trial this could undermine the experts credibility under examination
3845762 at the time of the first phone call an expert should be able to give an attorney a list of specific tasks that need to be accomplished and an approximate cost
3845763 too often lawyers collect the cvs and fee schedules of experts they pick the expert whose fees are the lowest
3845764 they dont stop to think about why the expert is less expensive
3845765 in the courtroom convincing evidence and a convincing demonstrative that show your theory fits the evidence will routinely trump great credentialing from the other side
3845766 so you can have someone thats a professor that has participated in this technical field for years and years and his opinion will not be valued as strongly as one good videotape that shows a perfect re creation of the incident
3845767 think having a great excuse for the absence of something is as good as the presence of something if the car is out of gas a great excuse for not having gas isnt going to start the car
3845768 it is extremely important not to hide any facts from your expert even if you think they will damage your case
3845769 it is far worse for your expert to be confronted with these facts on the witness stand
3845770 anytime that you introduce a technical theory into court as an attorney or as an expert youve got to assume there will be some smartass from mit that will pick you apart with a fine toothed comb
3845771 the good news is that if your theory is right and its the technical truth theres no way it can be picked apart but if its not right it should be relatively straightforward to crush your theory in a way that will be easily demonstrated to the jury
3845772 lawyers can mentally get into this world of what is legally true or false as by stipulation or everyone agrees that such and such but that doesnt make it factually true
3845773 is for a lawyer to treat an expert with the respect and professionalism that the lawyer would expect for himself

3845778 all documents provided to or by you to revised by relied upon or otherwise used in consultation with or as a basis for consultation with any expert witness identified by you pursuant to fed r civ proc 26 a 2
3845779 responsive documents will be produced in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure 26 a 2
3845780 to preserve all documents including e mails and drafts of a report
3845781 a ll d ocuments provided to or by y ou to revised by relied upon or otherwise used in consultation with or as a basis for consultation with any expert witness
3845782 to bring uniformity to the inconsistent practices around the country that now vary by jurisdiction and judge
3845783 w orking with experts has become a cumbersome process because of the possibility that draft reports and communications might ultimately be disclosed
3845784 w hen there are differences between early drafts and the final report juries have been misled into believing that the attorney client collaboration was improper even though federal rules recognize that there should be collaboration between experts and the lawyers who hire them
3845785 two experts where one is a consulting expert and the other is the trial expert the consulting experts reports are never disclosed so counsel will work with them and then hire a trial expert when the arguments have been tested while this process protects the client from the extra level of discovery it is costly and not available to those with limited resources
3845786 to be able to use his expert to the full extent possible without fear of creating discoverable material that can unfairly hurt his case
3845787 may want his expert to provide help in cross examining another expert and critiquing the other experts report without protection he cannot do that comfortably without risk of disclosure and discovery
3845788 if draft reports and communications are even arguably discoverable then the duty to preserve them attaches

3845869 we failed in not disabling the code in the final release of update 2 and not catching it in our quality assurance process
3845870 we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
3845871 i updated one of my five hosts and everything appears to be fine so far
3845872 thanks for all the hard work getting this patch out
3845873 unfortunately i think youve gotten a serious black eye today we were finally getting management happy with the idea of using esx for production servers and this set us back a little bit
3845874 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
3845875 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsoft corp s hyper v vmware ran face first into the very hurdle it was trying to clear
3845876 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise
3845877 two things come up that are prevalent with the creation of these games
3845878 finally some eagles fan recognizes the clear superiority of the beloved dallas cowboys its just too bad that said eagles fan doesnt understand just how superior they are by my super in depth research in which i will type down both names and then say its idiotic to believe that so and so from the cowboys isnt the best position in the league dallas is clearly better at all 22 positions on the field
3845879 i think the guys just got a little complacent last year
3845880 everyone knows in the nfl that if you show up each week and youre not ready to give 100 percent other teams are too good to let you get away with it
3845881 last year the focus just wasnt there this year is totally different you can really feel in on the practice field and in meetings were ready to play now
3845882 no hay planes para modificar la pol tica fundamental en la fijaci n de los precios a las gasolinas
3845883 we were able to establish the run game early which kind of softened up their defense
3845884 there are some things i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support
3845885 good for a guy that really played with a lot of pain and injury he did a good job because really he was hurt but he did a good job and im happy with him happy with his progress he just needs to play more
3845886 sheldon will be on the right side it depends on the personnel group all three of them could be on the field to start the game
3845887 jed did a nice job in the limited plays that he had offensively but also on special teams that fullback position youve got to produce on special teams or youre going to struggle to make it there he did the best job of the other guys on the special teams unit
3845888 were just trying to keep winston in one spot let him be productive at that spot g todd herremans is playing out at the left guard spot and he loves playing tackle so it gives him a chance to work in there and hes pretty good at it we also keep bringing t king dunlap along he had a good game the other night hes getting better ever day working his tail off
3845889 i think shawn could be a great left tackle i think he could step in and be one of the better left tackles in this league he just hasnt had a chance to work there we were going to do it in the offseason and he had the baby and that situation there then this here we havent been able to work him in there we have in years past hes worked there in the offseason he just hasnt had any work there this year
3845890 you know max did a nice job i thought he played very well actually now its against a 34 front he had a handful of times that he was covered where they kicked it down on the weak side this week hell be covered up just about every snap itll be another challenge for him there
3845891 thanks but no thanks your god gives you sermons and promises my god gave my lost at 720p beat that
3845892 this is going to be a bit of a rant and probably not useful for your project but i think this goes way beyond designing a seat i couldnt care less for a built in audio or video system if airlines would stop making such a fuss about me using my ipod i mean sorry if you could really bring down a plane with an ipod they would be banned just like uh toothpaste bottled water and other such dangerous things so lets stop the theatre i wish airlines would accept that personal electronic devices ipod laptops with dvd drives etc are how people consume their entertainment these days when they are on the move some of them may indeed be shoddily designed and emit much more radio signals than they ought to but then the solution is to have them tested and certified i am sure apple would happily comply with some faa testing if they could advertise their ipods and laptops as safe to be used even during takeoff and landing
3845893 we didnt do nearly as well as wed like there we were trying to get a lot of guys reps and as a matter of fact we had the starters in for the first kickoff and then we started subbing from that point we got a lot of young guys some reps a lot of new guys in there were just trying to get some talent evaluated it was a good opportunity to get that done
3845894 it was the first time hes ever had a kick return in a game so its to be expected
3845895 in terms of punt return weve got desean back there thats what hes done for years the only guy we brought in who didnt have experience was booker
3845896 lb andy studebaker did a nice job for us it felt like he was aggressive playing downhill and i feel like hes going to be able to give us some things there
3845897 he is one of the faster ones that i have coached yes hes been one of the faster ones
3845898 there are a couple of things that he has that allows him to be a really fast learner first of all hes a natural player his movements are just natural he does a lot of things that we teach that he just does naturally i hope i explained that well enough secondly hes really sharp football wise really for him it takes him once or twice maybe three reps and hes got it he can take it from the classroom to the field very quickly as well
3845899 his consistency is high he has taken advantage of an opportunity here it will be interesting to see how he does
3845900 kris is just now over the last several days appearing very comfortable with our offense he went through that learning process it was probably the last time i might have spoken about him and he was right in the middle of that learning process it looks like hes finding his way through that and it looks like hes playing really comfortably right now he has done very well the last several days and he did well during the game
3845901 whether youre a veteran player or youre a rookie this is a showcase for you
3845902 its a showcase to make the football team for those who end up making it and then for those who dont youve got positive film out there for other teams to look at you dont want to let one rep get away from you
3845903 he was great here and we wish him the best of luck

3845936 in this paper were reporting on the methods that were using to conduct the research
3845937 to inform other researchers that this valuable new data set will become available in the coming years
3845938 so far we have a very excellent return rate on the monthly calendar so there should be excellent information coming from the study in the next few years

3845942 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3845943 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3845944 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3845945 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
3845946 covert operation in which the u s government plotted against its citizens to win public support for war often that story line ends with the government killing ivins to cover its tracks and close the case
3845947 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
3845948 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3845949 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a

3845980 only option to prevent similar acts of aggression and occupation of georgia in the future is to give it the nato membership action plan

3846004 the ritz carlton paradise valley is destined to become a great asset for paradise valley as well as the state of arizona
3846005 the developer has demonstrated time and time again a willingness to work with the desires of the community
3846006 the high density of the ritz carlton residences will set a dangerous precedent the slippery slope will lead to increased traffic noise and pollution with no benefits to town residents demand for public services will increase with undue pressure on police fire and water resources
3846007 you can see as currently planned the impact of the development in our community will be tremendous and irrevocable
3846008 as a longtime paradise valley resident i welcome a quality project like the ritz development to our town
3846009 as longtime paradise valley residents wed like to join many of our friends and neighbors in welcoming the ritz carlton hotel to our community such a resort will exemplify the high quality design and premier service and standards that have come to be associated with paradise valley

3846011 as a paradise valley resident and business owner with an office across the street from the proposed ritz development project im in full support of the passage of proposition 411 such a project will bring valuable amenities to our community and help preserve our town best known for its luxurious resorts and tourism opportunities
3846012 paradise valley is a town like no other in the country we have managed to keep our rural character reduced traffic and unique architecture despite the explosive growth in surrounding communities this has allowed our property values to be some of the highest in the state this is also the reason we have attracted premier resorts to our town the proposed ritz carlton is no exception they have taken all of these unique qualities and made them a part of their planned community instead of building a huge 500 room resort as the original zoning allowed they designed a resort that fits in perfectly with our community and preserves what makes paradise valley special the ritz carlton will preserve our views minimize neighborhood traffic maintain the communitys desert landscaping and southwestern architecture and help maintain our high property values as the person who first brought the ritz carlton brand to the valley nearly 20 years ago i ask you to join me in voting yes for the ritz carlton project and prop 411
3846013 one of the things that drew us to paradise valley may now be in peril

3846067 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3846068 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3846069 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3846070 solamente tienes poder sobre las personas mientras no les quites todo pero cuando has robado todo a un hombre l ya no est en tu poder es libre nuevamente
3846071 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3846072 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3846073 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3846074 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3846075 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3846076 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3846077 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
3846078 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
3846079 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3846080 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3846081 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3846082 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3846083 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3846084 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3846085 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3846086 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3846087 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3846088 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3846089 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3846090 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3846091 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3846092 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3846093 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3846120 signs are starting to point to the new living translation as a major contender for the spot of top english translation that the niv has held onto for the last two decades
3846121 a major translation comes along every few generations and it can become a default translation the kjv was one of these the rsv was one at least for ncc churches the niv was one now in my opinion the nlt is one
3846122 it seems that the study bible and the nlt in particular is becoming the translation of choice for a lot of people
3846123 surprise surprise the second largest layout was for the nlt with 3 display units
3846124 a couple of commenters confirm that theyve observed this trend in their local bookstores as well
3846125 the second coming of the nlt has taken the bible world by storm
3846126 and then we have the issue of who translated the new living translation careful there young restless and reformed some of your favorites have been doing some dynamic equivalence translation behind your back
3846127 i m especially thrilled that we can together provide broader distribution and more creative access to a quality translation that will bring god s living word to bear on more and more people wayne leman said

3846130 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3846131 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3846132 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia

3846134 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

3846174 your next attack that requires you to be behind the target can be made from any position

3846177 poet is making a 4 million investment in this pilot facility which will give us the scale we need to make final improvements in our technology before we start construction next year on project liberty our commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plant in emmetsburg iowa
3846178 very little field corn is used as food in this country so corn in itself is not exactly a food source it does end up getting fed to cattle and hogs and that becomes a food source
3846179 but of course cellulose is more of a non food source
3846180 so we see a very bright future for biofuels in general both from grain and from cellulose
3846181 it started setting in a little bit after the 200 meter butterfly race
3846182 i was just sort of trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time it is a pretty cool saying a pretty cool title you could say

3846190 fire eagle is about making everything on the internet more useful fun or interesting by adding the element of location
3846191 were here to help people take their location to the web by giving them the ability to control how much detail about their location they want to share and which applications they want to share it with
3846192 one of the early ways our users started to use dipity was to aggregate a lot of their social media content into one place pulling their blog posts their flickr photo streams their tweets from twitter stuff like that
3846193 we thought well the one missing piece is location for a lot of stuff

3846208 i have two kids im worried about so i have other priorities
3846209 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3846210 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
3846211 i have two kids im worried about so i have other priorities
3846212 all three parties must agree if there is to be an agreement there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
3846213 we are at a crossroads in our country the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership mr tsvangirai must put national interest before self interest
3846214 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3846215 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mr mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3846216 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters

3846227 leading online ad platforms such as google gorilla nation valueclick and yahoo have all employed mysql to help cost effectively develop and sustain their data intensive technology infrastructure
3846228 these blue chip ad vendors highlight the innovation and business growth that is possible when powering todays web economy
3846229 gorilla nation has experienced huge growth in recent years and subsequently we needed strong database technology that we could operate quickly and efficiently without paying the huge upfront licensing costs required by proprietary software

3846238 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3846239 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3846240 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3846241 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3846242 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3846243 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3846244 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3846248 the standard of proof for confirming and publishing information on this kind of private intimate behavior is and should be very high i have not the slightest regret for sticking to those high standards getting it first is great getting it right is essential
3846249 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
3846250 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first
3846251 i am really 15 but i think i may know which site they are confused about my age from as this admin was thinking he was better then me because i was younger then him so i changed my age and chatted a load of rubbish i didnt know that people were going to take it so seriously he never was in hospital he isnt ill at the moment and he now knows who hacked him and explained i am going to go and do something for a bit

3846253 a starting point and a true foundation for future relations
3846254 we are comfortable with the sequence of positive developments in lebanon
3846255 syria is ready to restore ties to normal the aim today is to clear the atmosphere and correct the relations
3846256 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanise but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
3846257 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3846258 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3846259 they become cyclical community visibility allows community awareness which manifests community understanding of your mission volunteer recruitment permits board development auxiliary boards committees who attract donor cultivation through client customer member involvement
3846260 what we tried to do was develop a multifaceted approach to not only increase campus safety and improve emergency response but we also wanted to avert behaviors such as bullying
3846261 now school administrators and security officers from around the country are interested in our legislation
3846262 we know there is a direct correlation between young people who are bullied and the possibility that those experiences can lead to tragedies like the deadly shootings at columbine
3846263 that makes it extremely critical that we have the tools in place to stop bullying before its too late
3846264 that really made it hit home this is someone who actually knows what hes talking about
3846265 hes been in law enforcement and in his position in the senate hes trying to get things passed that he knows will help law enforcement officers and schools around the country
3846266 there is no way we can give up on the peace process there are a lot of things and recommendation that worth pursuing
3846267 hopefully the day after tomorrow friday a great majority will have returned to their homes
3846268 you get angry when you ve been at the top of your game when you re rated the no 1 fullback and then free agency comes and i kind of felt like rudolph the red nosed reindeer because of my age i got left out of the reindeer games because you re 37 teams are saying ok but your age teams discriminate against you because of your age not because of what you can do so i think that was the toughest part sitting out and knowing that you re still in great shape knowing that you still can run knowing that you can still compete just because of a number and your age people say ok i don t know if this guy can last i don t know if this guy can play those people that are out there that doubted me i m back and i m coming for everybody that doubted me the ravens and tampa bay buccaneers were a couple of the teams interested in neal over the last couple weeks but neal said he chose the ravens because general manager ozzie newsome was the first one to contact him prior to the teams preseason opener against the new england patriots last thursday night and make a promise to bring him in anytime a guy does that and says that that s integrity
3846269 i could run around and try to get into a bidding war but it s about saying hey you know what
3846270 we don t want to have our defense give up just 10 points that s unfair so i think you ll see this offense score some points and we re going to surprise some people
3846271 his incident was an accident he fell from a building
3846272 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
3846273 im not co producing it and i wont be involved in any way
3846274 the first i heard about it was when people sent me cuttings from us papers
3846275 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
3846276 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
3846277 the original has some qualities that cant be reproduced but a remake could have its own very different strengths and qualities
3846278 further analysis and refinement of the approach will be necessary to understand whether this experimental approach can eventually be applied to people
3846279 while human ips cells are not exactly the same as human es cells they nevertheless point the way to an exciting future in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine
3846280 we are aware of the issue on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
3846281 i live in downtown los angeles where 3g coverage is a given and not only is the 3g wonky and unreliable but oftentimes im struggling to even get decent edge support
3846282 edge is absolutely worse on my new 3g than it ever was on my first generation iphone
3846283 however because these effects in animals occur at bisphenol a exposure levels similar to those experienced by humans the possibility that bisphenol a may alter human development cannot be dismissed
3846284 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3846285 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things
3846286 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
3846287 i just told him im very very proud of him he was courageous and that he did everything that he could do
3846288 i remember seeing anna simcic narrowly miss a medal in barcelona in 1992 and i was only new to new zealand i thought how wonderful is that she didnt really get the accolades she deserved
3846289 now the times are so fast anything you do now if you get in a final here you are awesome
3846290 the last 10m it feels like youve got lead arms he said
3846291 i gave it everything and i had nothing left i left it all in the pool just disappointed i didnt get up there for a medal but
3846292 he was very calm very positive he prepares himself very well moss hes a great champion hes not afraid he relishes the opportunities good on him
3846293 he can keep on improving this is a much hotter field than the world champs my goodness if you look at those times and see what that would have got him in 2007
3846294 this is much higher standard all around at this olympics that you could ever see anywhere in the world this is huge thats just the luck of where we are at this particular day and time in history
3846295 and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3846296 standing with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3846297 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3846298 europe has to get engaged physically on the ground and europe has to stop that from happening
3846299 the european union cannot be indifferent to this war these massacres on our doorstep
3846300 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3846301 it just doesnt seem to me to be very smart in such a time of crisis to decide whether we should revert to the previous situation
3846302 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3846303 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3846304 the car was clearly marked they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in humanitarian community in afghanistan
3846305 since they oppose the current government they also oppose those who work with it
3846306 and unfortunately they dont differentiate among armed multinational forces security contractors and humanitarian groups
3846307 the irc provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3846308 often these pets are their only companion and it is vital the owners dont feel any stress in looking after them
3846309 we are trying to ascertain whether its a suicide blast or not
3846310 brain tissue cultured from rats has controlled a wheeled robot around a lab according to new scientist this week researchers in the uk have
3846311 the team at the university of reading in the uk hope their research will help provide treatments for diseases like alzheimers and epilepsy
3846312 this system is a model everything it does is merely similar to what goes on in a brain its not really the same thing we can learn about the brain but it may mislead us
3846313 aside from any kind of monetization of it im glad to know that a million people have it on their ipods
3846314 if you paid for it great but i want everyone to hear it you know i want to blow peoples minds
3846315 fear has governed my life if i think about it
3846316 i dont even know why im saying this in an interview situation but i always feel like im not good enough for some reason i wish that wasnt the case but left to my own devices that voice starts speaking up
3846317 start it up again like it matters anymore i dont know if it does
3846318 an aggressive honest naked angry ugly thing i dont hear anybody doing anything like that right now that im aware of maybe there are but it doesnt seem like its the flavor of today
3846319 i dont agree that it should be free but it is free and you can either accept it or you can put your head in the sand
3846320 now just making good music or great music isnt enough
3846321 now i have to sell t shirts or i have to choose which whorish association is the least stinky i dont really want to be on the side of a bus or in a blackberry ad hawking some product that sucks just so i can get my record out i want to maintain some dignity and self respect in the process if thats possible these days
3846322 these days i work too much i think because it makes me feel good
3846323 i dont know how to do that in a relationship
3846324 i am announcing that i am separated from lisaraye mccoy misick
3846325 i am committed to dissolving the marriage amicably i believe that this is a private matter and will have no further comments i hope that our privacy will be respected
3846326 i very much appreciate your depth of knowledge in the mortgage industry i originally heard you on your radio show being a natural skeptic i listened several times to your show and i read your book i then researched the yield spread premium amounts on my previous property acquisitions and refinances a total of eleven of them and since i didnt go through a bank thank goodness every single one of them showed an ysp amount
3846327 i found your site on technorati and read a few of your other posts keep up the good work i just added
3846328 i head up fixed income ir at ambac please understand that ambac did not push for the new fas157
3846329 this new policy assures real accountability and transparency and that the decision stays in the hands of elected officials not an unelected board
3846330 a critical plank in the economic recovery of the region
3846331 when do we bring you into a project and why
3846332 why do you make a sitemap instead of the technology team
3846333 why do you suddenly get to tell me what to design if im a designer and youre not
3846334 since leaving spamalot in may jokes have just not been funny food has lost its taste the grass is no longer green the sky no longer blue and babies wont stop crying im so excited about coming back to the funniest show in the world
3846335 if the business mix shift towards wholesale banking continues we believe the underlying profitability of the group will be undermined particularly if the benign credit conditions deteriorate as asian economic growth slows
3846336 one of the least likely to need a rights issue or face financial distress
3846337 it is clear that the adverse market conditions affecting the residential sector will continue for some time to come
3846338 in light of the current market conditions we intend to reduce the running rate of our overhead costs by 10pc by the end of this financial year
3846339 despite the challenging trading market our unique portfolio is showing relatively good liquidity
3846340 it needs to continue to reduce debt levels to protect it against a more dramatic downturn in the uk residential market than we predict and afford it the headroom to expand through acquisitions once market conditions are right to do so
3846341 about two more hours and we can clean up here and head for dinner
3846342 im a vietnam war vet i came to work with abandoned children because i know what it means to be tossed aside like them im trying to forget the people who failed me i dont always trust outsiders
3846343 we have 200 25 eager students and a whole day left in our trip is there anything we can do for you if we come back tomorrow
3846344 the children havent had meat in a year and that window up there is broken
3846345 whats going on these kids cant still be hungry go see if you can figure out where all the foods wandering off to
3846346 believes that uk historical ad spending rises cannot be sustained as advertisers pull away from decaying circulation which has fallen by 33 in the past 20 years compared with a 19 fall in the us
3846347 cautioned that uk newspaper stocks which have fallen by 40 since the start of the year compared with us papers down by 48 could fall farther
3846348 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3846349 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3846350 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website
3846351 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3846352 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3846353 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3846354 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3846355 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3846356 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3846357 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3846358 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3846359 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3846360 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3846361 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3846362 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3846363 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3846364 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3846365 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers
3846366 we believe that standard chartered needs to strengthen its equity tier 1 ratio from the current level of 6 1 per cent which puts it close to the bottom versus 70 asian banks under coverage
3846367 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage
3846368 will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3846369 worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3846370 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3846371 weakening consumer spending will likely hurt all ad categories in 2008 we think 2009 may be just as bad if not worse
3846372 relative upside at the other end of this tunnel with regional newspapers retaining local higher priced advertising
3846373 our view is that micro focus is very well attuned to the current economic climate anticipating that the market and operational commentary should remain positive we retain our buy
3846374 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3846375 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3846376 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3846377 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3846378 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3846379 our members in johnston press want to produce high quality local papers but they are finding they have to work incredibly long hours sometimes dangerously long hours in order to do so
3846380 the ferag finishing lines we have acquired recently give us the opportunity to relocate finishing from greaves to our other print sites thereby improving efficiency and reducing transportation
3846381 this closure represented another hammer blow to the print and packaging industry which is already reeling from the closures of curtis and beith and the announced job cuts at sappi and johnston press
3846382 which would you prefer a reduction to previous levels of power supplies or some form of manpower system based on employing more full time staff but flexed on some form of average hours basis which would you choose
3846383 la mayor a de los aumentos observados en las temperaturas medias del globo desde la mitad del siglo xx son muy probablemente debidos al aumento observado en las concentraciones de gei antropog nicas
3846384 actividad solar y clima terrestre un an lisis de algunas pretendidas correlaciones
3846385 en la investigaci n y la creaci n de modelos clim ticos debemos reconocer que nos enfrentamos con un sistema ca tico no lineal y por lo tanto las predicciones a largo plazo de los estados clim ticos futuros no son posibles
3846386 there are probably enough lonmin shareholders who want to sell out and invest in other mining plays the rejection does not mean that we wont see a takeover
3846387 we see the bid as opportunistic synergy driven and likely to succeed
3846388 we see very little chance of a counter bid and it is a case of who blinks first between xstrata and the lonmin shareholders
3846389 lonmin shareholders are rightly fed up with incumbent management and we feel they will definitely not back a go it alone strategy and will want to lose this offer
3846390 when managements are this unloved platinum group metals prices are weak and interloper risk is low xstrata have a fair chance of taking this home at the offer price
3846391 we believe there is a good chance that johnston press will announce a specific costs target or signal a significant exercise is under way to improve efficiency
3846392 the aircraft will be carrying medical supplies shelters bedding those types of things
3846393 that will be the first flight in there are plans for another flight tomorrow as we continue to assess the wide range of humanitarian assistance options that we might be able to provide both in the immediate and long term humanitarian capabilities
3846394 were looking at a broader range of assets and capabilities that we might bring to bear on the humanitarian need there
3846395 weve had a strong relationship with georgia for many years now
3846396 we could not be more pleased to bring the ipig to the masses
3846397 todays consumer demands electronics that function at a high level while still being a welcomed addition to each individuals d cor the ipig satisfies both needs with superior sound quality and a unique aesthetically pleasing design
3846398 each one of you has something no one else has or has ever had your fingerprints your brain your heart be an individual be unique stand out make noise make someone notice thats the power of individuals
3846399 i can foresee it benefiting us in a lot of ways we can post applications for water and sewer merchants can link to our site and it will serve an outlet through us that will give people the ability to do business
3846400 were still at the point of believing that we have no source water contamination so to look at spending 80 000 for a chlorination contact system were not there yet
3846401 based on the what the auditor recommends there may be a time to write some of them uncollected debt off the books
3846402 i will review the delinquent accounts im pretty sure some of them date back as much as four years but some i would like to be able track the business a little further
3846403 the siren will be erected on city property at a wastewater treatment system lift station behind indian rock golf courses clubhouse
3846404 first it must be erected on city property and we already own the lift station
3846405 second its the second most densely populated part of town
3846406 where would i be in times like these without the songs loretta wrote
3846407 good things only come to those who hit the road when they know what they want
3846408 all the things on earth worth having are things that weve already got
3846409 bet on your anger if thats what you choose nothings gonna change everybodys gonna lose

3846416 i didnt know theyd be the same one day loving you letting you go
3846417 i cant have you thinking of me as just the one who keeps you where you dont want to be
3846418 is it okay for me to say my mind is not a junkyard my heart is not a dump for all the gunk around my spirits not a junkyard no its holy ground
3846419 time passes by people pass on in the drop of a tear theyre gone

3846421 the dream that saves me is that youre happy and youre free
3846422 i will always be near and ill love you from here
3846423 the popularity of the iphone along with the emergence of various applications and faster connectivity makes it an ideal platform for developing applications that incorporate quality real time voip
3846424 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3846425 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3846426 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3846427 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3846428 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3846429 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3846430 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3846431 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3846432 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3846433 the right information has to be given to the people
3846434 es tambi n la capacidad que tenemos de ponernos de acuerdo independientemente de nuestras diferencias que existen desde luego que son profundas pero no pueden ir m s all de las necesidades y los problemas de la gente
3846435 desde luego que nadie lo quiere dios no lo quiera y aqu esperaremos que no sea as pero se trata no s lo de atenernos a la buena voluntad de dios y de la naturaleza sino de hacer lo que tenemos que hacer para evitar inundaciones catastr ficas
3846436 la pol tica vieja en m xico dec a que las obras p blicas hay que hacerlas s lo las que se ven y se pueden reconocer
3846437 es un viejo mito falso o cierto la verdad es que el hecho es que obras como sta no se hicieron durante mucho tiempo
3846438 cuando los gobiernos nos ponemos de acuerdo podemos atender los problemas de la gente y resolverlos no importa qu grandes sean
3846439 la voluntad de poder construir soluciones para que pueda la gente verdaderamente vivir mejor en la ciudad de m xico

3846445 the florida democratic party today called on the fbi and other authorities to investigate the allegations that congressman vern buchanan r fl13 violated the law by intimidating employees to donate to his campaign reimbursing employees for their campaign donations and engaging in fraudulent business practices
3846446 media outlets have uncovered very serious allegations of fraud and violations of election laws by congressman vern buchanan based on the seriousness of the charges being made it is only appropriate that the fbi and other authorities begin investigating these allegations

3846448 a joint between the third and forth cars came off
3846449 rumors say that the primary works for the structure of the park will end by end of july and that in fall 2006 the second building phase will start always according unconfirmed rumors but quite reliable the initial structure will have few of the features announced in the conference not really as far as the quality of the structure but as for the area the park will cover they will start building the main street and two of the theme areas the park will then be completed by 2011 the initial structure should have 2 dark rides 4 show areas and 2 roller coasters one almost surely vekoma and the other intamin the first will allegedly have a big covered section
3846450 sooner or later we all discover that the important moments in life are not the advertised ones not the birthdays the graduations the weddings not the great goals achieved the real milestones are less prepossessing they come to the door of memory unannounced stray dogs that amble in sniff around a bit and simply never leave our lives are measured by these
3846451 now its north americas turn and we intend to deliver these small cars profitably

3846457 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction
3846458 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3846459 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3846460 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3846461 i led in the abramoff hearings in the in the obscure indian affairs committee for which people are still testifying and going to jail
3846462 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption
3846463 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington
3846464 will be coming to atlanta on august 18 for a very special event at the marriott marquis downtown and i have agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team

3846466 do you think you might be able to contact karl as i am sure you have more weight there
3846467 talked to rove about this and i think i killed it hes on it keep this between us dont want to raise expectations but i banged on this one hard
3846468 with over 380 million users already owing live id credentials it is easy for new members to register on our site and communicate with a very large community that already exists
3846469 we could redesign and deploy our new site much faster than with traditional website development tools this saved resources and got the upgraded site online quickly
3846470 the expert advice and code samples in the languages we use were extremely useful
3846471 we are confident that the windows live platform will continue to grow and improve with time
3846472 the washington apple is an icon of quality around the globe
3846473 this is a natural home for the advanced science necessary to map the tree fruit genome and actively study how it functions
3846474 investing in this program is a matter of building on our strengths in horticulture to leverage bottom line results for industry
3846475 this is one more step forward in the partnership between wsu and specialty crops in washington
3846476 this effort not only builds a knowledge base for apples but for all crops within the rosaceae its a pleasure to see the partnership expand to include the scientific expertise at the university of washington
3846477 this initiative will establish washington as the worldwide hub for rosaceae functional genomics and is attracting internationally renowned scientists as well as quality graduate and undergraduate students to rosaceae research at wsu
3846478 the integration of this apple genome sequence data with other peach and strawberry genome sequence data will maximize the utility of this data to the world wide plant research community and further enhance wsus reputation as a leader in plant science
3846479 there is tremendous opportunity for crop improvement when its guided by a detailed understanding of plant genomes sequencing the apple genome will allow us to identify all the genes to understand which genes drive which traits and to better select for desirable genes and traits the advent of ultra high throughput dna sequencing instrumentation makes such a project feasible at reasonable cost
3846480 bioinformatic prediction of the function of the genes deciphered from this sequence will speed up development of functional markers that we can use for innovative crop improvement through apple and other tree fruit breeding programs
3846481 pear sweet cherry and raspberry are some other washington fruit crops closely related to apples so the benefits of this work will also accrue to improvement in those commodities
3846482 validating how the genes function in a rapid cycling apple that is those that flower in a few weeks rather than years will enable us to generate reliable markers for genomics assisted crop improvement
3846483 that represents one of the immediate tangible outcomes of this initiative that will be of great benefit to the industry worldwide
3846484 besides nurturing a fresh inter disciplinary synergy the genome discovery project is exposing computer science students to new frontiers in biology and catalyzing the development of novel computational methods for distilling large amounts of genomic information
3846485 this project further enables us to train students in sequence analysis methods providing them with highly sought after bioinformatic skills
3846486 ntc is well known for the forward looking thought leadership with which it has served the media and entertainment industry for more than 25 years

3846488 new consumer displays and the challenge of providing content to take advantage of advanced capabilities
3846489 during the past few years a major shift has occurred in the type of display that is considered the typical home
3846490 the role of metadata and process in the evolution of media
3846491 this is because of the commonly recognized importance of semantic metadata in effectively supporting various media related activities such as intelligent search and retrieval of media assets web
3846492 the impact of technology upon metadata collection costs courvoisier or cold duck
3846493 this paper focuses on the impact of technology on the cost of metadata
3846494 we compare these costs within representative media and entertainment workflows when using either traditional or modern file based technologies projections regarding the ongoing impact of technology upon metadata costs will also be examined
3846495 until best practices emerge this area will be subject to significant upheaval and innovation
3846496 is there room for standardization here will these technologies be applicable to other areas this papers purpose is to provide clarity to this important and evolving issue
3846497 service oriented architecture solutions have been used by it departments in banking and other fields for more than a decade
3846498 they are stable and mature and are now being leveraged to facilitate the television and media entertainment industrys transition from physical to file based technologies and workflows soa is an architectural approach that improves file based workflow efficiencies allows for easier integration of multiple software and hardware applications within a facility and provides the agility to integrate future technology advances as they become available
3846499 in 2005 06 the average player 25 and under made 865 000 while players aged 30 and over made an average of 2 07 million
3846500 this coming season based on contracts already signed the average player 25 and under will make 1
3846501 whats remarkable about that is that almost no 25 year old players are eligible for unrestricted free agency while under the new collective bargaining agreement every player 30 and older would have been at some point
3846502 in the old system teams were overpaying or paying a lot of money for the 31 year olds who were unproductive and not producing up to that level i really feel that if youre going to pay the big money its the 23 to 29 year olds that deserve the money
3846503 this is one of the most star studded classes we will ever have installed into the u s hockey hall of fame
3846504 for mike richter brian leetch and cammi granato service to the stars and stripes was determined by an accident of birth for the fourth member of the u s hockey hall of fame class of 2008 who was unveiled tuesday it was a matter of choice
3846505 brett hull was born in belleville ont and his father bobby was a canadian hockey icon but dual citizenship his mother joanne was an american allowed the golden brett to become a nephew of uncle sam
3846506 when the u s asked me to play at the world championships in 1986
3846507 i had been drafted by calgary in 1984 but i had no idea where i was as a hockey player or who i was as a hockey player i was this young guy in college at the university of minnesota duluth and they saw potential in me they gave me a chance to go to the world championships and for that i will eternally be grateful
3846508 if i was 25 years old perhaps i would have become a king
3846509 f r mich war dies ein furchterregender schritt aber im r ckblick eine meiner besten entscheidungen
3846510 denn viel von dem was mir auf meinem weg begegnete erwies sich sp ter als unbezahlbar
3846511 sie m ssen auf etwas vertrauen auf ihren bauch das leben oder was immer
3846512 manchmal wirft einem das leben einen ziegelstein an den kopf
3846513 der einzige weg zur erf llung ist eine arbeit zu finden die sie wirklich lieben wenn sie die noch nicht gefunden haben suchen sie weiter
3846514 ihre zeit ist begrenzt also verschwenden sie sie nicht indem sie anderer leute leben leben lassen sie sich nicht von dogmen einfangen lassen sie nicht zu dass der l rm fremder meinungen ihre eigene innere stimme bert nt

3846516 wenn sie mir f r dieselbe fahrstrecke f r die sie heute einen liter benzin brauchen ebenfalls 1 50 euro geben und einen vierjahresvertrag unterschreiben dann schenken wir ihnen das elektroauto dazu das funktioniert wie bei einem handyvertrag und nach vier jahren bekommen sie ein neues elektroauto
3846517 so wie es ringtones f rs handy gibt k nnen sie jeden motorsound haben den sie wollen
3846518 our product launches are based on having listened to our customers and introducing new products to meet their needs
3846519 only apple seems to be able to introduce a computer and get a pop to their stock
3846520 its how you put all these pieces together for a particular audience that matters
3846521 and i was part of the launch of microsoft virtualization

3846524 i think the overall industry growth will be pretty healthy i feel it is possible that dell will grow faster than the industry
3846525 when we evaluated our position said okay we need to reboot the dell operating system
3846526 what you are seeing is kind of a new dell that is emerging
3846527 theyre great for their intended uses but theyre not for everyone
3846528 if lge pet er kernen i mange terrorgruppers budskab at muslimer undertrykkes og ydmyges af vesten de har et anti vestligt verdenssyn og bruger sproget til at skabe en kl ft mellem muslimer og resten af verden p den m de retf rdigg res vold i islams navn
3846529 theyre great for their intended uses but theyre not for everyone
3846530 if an independent software vendor discovers that they have shipped a vulnerable activex control they should e mail us to work with microsoft to issue a kill bit disabling that control
3846531 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
3846532 they said many times that they are working as a coalition to better secure the windows operating system and everything which runs on it
3846533 while microsoft has issued a few kill bits in the past for third party products this is something we are going to continue to see going forward
3846534 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3846535 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3846536 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3846537 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3846538 because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3846539 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3846540 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3846541 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else

3846544 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3846545 he mendis is a bit different and the batsmen need some time to settle in we have to be positive but ultimately it comes down to how we play him in the middle
3846546 its tough to say anything right now but we know what he have to do we know our abilities and are quite confident
3846547 after a long time we have two match winning spinners we now have more attacking options
3846548 murali has now got the support he needs and there is also support for vaas its quite a relief for a captain to have such an option in mendis for us it is always a team game
3846549 we are not complacent because we know the one dayers are a very different game we are confident with the way we are playing and have to make sure we execute our plans as we did in the tests
3846550 it is always difficult to replace him tendulkar as he contributes not only with his batting and bowling but also comes out with brilliant suggestions
3846551 i really didnt expect it im really excited people always used to call me either cute or pretty but no one ever called me sexy i take it as a compliment
3846552 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3846553 this is a big deal its a real honor for the whole country theres an amazing energy in china for this event
3846554 i think what was really nice was that the mayor placed my segment on top of the ancient wall and then i came down the stairs
3846555 having the chance to be on the wall and identify with the heritage and everything else was really nice
3846556 it couldnt be better than to have your kids screaming and taking pictures
3846557 i didnt find out until they sent me a letter asking for my shoe size and shirt size
3846558 and then the list was published on the internet by each olympic committee and thats when i saw my name and it was the only foreign name on there
3846559 these sites are being destroyed left and right especially in asia where theres been a lot of growth so they just wipe them out
3846560 a lot of them just dont realize that their grandkids could be making thousands of dollars on this type of thing
3846561 if you take advantage of one of these sites and develop it responsibly youre going to be bringing thousands of people out of poverty
3846562 we try to set up a financial trust thats sustainable and more money keeps going into it to keep things going
3846563 its a coal mining region in china it had a wall around it and it was a poor place in the middle of nowhere
3846564 they come in on a bus and they leave they maybe eat and throw away their garbage and go to the restroom that costs money for the town this region is getting destroyed
3846565 were trying to get the local business people to be the owners of the site we fund capacity building training and planning and help them on initial conservation work
3846566 local people really give us the fuel to accomplish the mission and do 12 projects at the same time
3846567 i think heritage conservation is fairly new on an international level some smaller people have been doing it for a while but in terms of peoples minds its pretty new
3846568 we really want to i think emphasize the importance of these sites in the world and in the big picture
3846569 also the sites are nonrenewable a forest can grow back but sites cant once theyre gone theyre gone forever and were losing them on our watch right now
3846570 heritage conservation is fairly new on an international level some smaller people have been doing it for a while but in terms of peoples minds its pretty new
3846571 does not believe that the evolution of state tort law will cause the development of standards that would be at odds with the agencys regulations
3846572 the right to provide a traditional damages remedy for violations of common law duties
3846573 the threat of a damages remedy will give manufacturers an additional cause to comply
3846574 an honest man can feel no pleasure in the exercise of power over his fellow citizens
3846575 i would vote for it if it only pertained to restricting elected officials from receiving two or more salaries absolutely
3846576 but i would never say a person whos a janitor or policeman shouldnt receive an additional salary as a councilperson
3846577 maybe he makes 25 000 you think im going to restrict him from making another 25 000 as a councilman no im sorry i couldnt do that
3846578 im not going to let anyone hurt the little guy
3846579 i decided as long as i was going to hell i might as well do it thoroughly
3846580 your number was up the first time i met you
3846581 you were right im definitely fighting fate trying to keep you alive
3846582 dont you see thats what proves me right i care the most because if i can do it if leaving is the right thing to do then ill hurt myself to keep from hurting you to keep you safe
3846583 and so the lion fell in love with the lamb
3846584 i may not be a human but i am a man
3846585 no coffins no piled skulls in the corners i dont even think we have cobwebs what a disappointment this must be for you
3846586 i love you its a poor excuse for what im doing but its still true
3846587 i dont seem to be strong enough to stay away from you so i suppose that youll get your way whether it kills you or not
3846588 when someone want to kill you youre brave as a lion and then when someone mentions dancing
3846589 about three things i was absolutely positive first edward was a vampire second there was a part of him and i didnt know how potent that part might be that thirsted for my blood and the third i was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him
3846590 the only solace the only hope i had left was knowing that i would see edward soon maybe if i could just see his face again i would also be able to see the solution that eluded me now
3846591 you are my life youre the only thing it would hurt me to lose
3846592 its been almost a century that edwards been alone now hes found you you cant see the changes that we see we who have been with him for so long do you think any of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you
3846593 i promise that this will be the last time youll see me i wont come back i wont put you through anything like this again you can go on with your life without any more interference from me it will be as if id never existed
3846594 you should probably know that im breaking the rules right now well not technically since he said i was never to walk through his door again and i came in the window but still the intent was clear
3846595 i thought id explained it clearly before bella i cant live in a world where you dont exist
3846596 i could see it in your eyes that you honestly believed that i didnt want you anymore the most absurd ridiculous concept as if there were any way that i could exist without needing you
3846597 how can i put this so that youll believe me youre not asleep and youre not dead im here and i love you i have always loved you and i will always love you i was thinking of you seeing your face in my mind every second that i was away when i told you that i didnt want you it was the very blackest kind of blasphemy
3846598 why can you believe the lie but not the truth
3846599 my heart hasnt beat in almost ninety years but this was different it was like my heart was gone like i was hollow like id left everything that was inside me here with you
3846600 what choice have i i cannot be without you but i will not destroy your soul
3846601 if you dont mind id much rather you didnt hide your face ive lived without it for as long as i can stand
3846602 i didnt have to look to know who it was this was a voice i would know anywhere know and respond to wheter i was awake or asleep or even dead id bet the voice id walk through fire for or less dramatically slosh every day through the cold and endless rain for
3846603 you can have my soul i dont want it without you its yours already
3846604 i could not do anything else i had to keep moving if i stopped looking for him it was over love life meaning over
3846605 time passes even when it seems impossible even when each tick of the second hand aches like the pulse of blood behind a bruise it passes unevenly in strange lurches and dragging lulls but pass it does even for me
3846606 i saw no reason for fear i couldnt imagine anything in the world that there was left to be afraid of not physically at least one of the few advantages of losing everything
3846607 as much as i struggled not to think of him i did not struggle to forget
3846608 because there was just one thing that i had to believe to be able to live i had to know that he existed that was all everything else i could endure so long as he existed
3846609 forbidden to remember terrified to forget it was a hard line to walk
3846610 but what if this hole never got any better if the raw edges never healed if the damage was permanent and irreversible
3846611 id already lived through the worst thing possible in comparison with that why should anything frighten me now i should be able to look death in the face and laugh
3846612 one thing i truly knew knew it in the pit of my stomach in the center of my bones knew it from the crown of my head to the stoles of my feet knew it deep in my empty chest was how love gave someone the power to break you id been broken beyond repair
3846613 could i betray my absent heart to save my pathetic life
3846614 it was heaven right smack in the middle of hell
3846615 the way i feel about you will never change of course i love you and theres nothing you can do about it
3846616 if you believed as he did could you take away his soul
3846617 im dead right i did drown crap crap crap this is gonna kill charlie
3846618 i can see where you might confuse me with a nightmare but i cant imagine what you could have done to wind up in hell did you commit many murders while i was away
3846619 obviously not if i was in hell you wouldnt be with me
3846620 if we could bottle your luck wed have a weapon of mass destruction on our hands
3846621 do you really have any idea how important you are to me any concept at all of how much i love you
3846622 ill be back so soon you wont have time to miss me look after my heart ive left it with you
3846623 would you please tell me what are you thinking before i go mad
3846624 but if you ever bring her back damaged again and i dont care whose fault it it i dont care if she merely trips or if a meteor falls out of the sky and hits her in the head if you return her to me in less than the perfect condition that i left her in you will be running with three legs do you understand that mongrel
3846625 you know jacob if it werent for the fact that were natural enemies and that youre also trying to steal away the reason for my existence i might actually like you
3846626 when it comes to all this enemies nonsense im out i am a neutral country i am switzerland
3846627 i had to never hurt him again that would be my mission in life never again would i be the reason for this look to come into his eyes
3846628 he loves you more than you know it terrifies him to be away from you
3846629 it wont be the same for me you wont let me be like that well live in antarctica
3846630 but i am a werewolf and he is a vampire
3846631 yes do me a favor and challenge him to an arm wrestling match it would be a good experience for him
3846632 one more thing ill be fighting for her too you should know that im not taking anything for granted and ill be fighting twice as hard as you will
3846633 she is mine i didnt say i would fight fair
3846634 i knew you were just as crazy jealous as i am
3846635 im not such a fool as to wear it on my sleeve like you do it doesent help your case you know
3846636 i should ive had a hundred years to gain it a hundred years of waiting for her
3846637 hes like a drug for you bella i see that you cant live without him now its too late but i would have been healthier for you not a drug i would have been the air the sun
3846638 i used to think of you that way you know like the sun my personal sun you balanced out the clouds nicely for me
3846639 the secret of making something work in your life is first of all the deep desire to make it work then the faith and belief that it can work then hold that clear definite vision in your consciousness and see it working out step by step without one thought of doubt or disbelief

3846656 not surprisingly such a perspective is also often linked to an extremist end time obsession that acts as fertile ground for the planting watering and harvesting of all kinds of conspiracy theories related to such things as the anti christ the great apostasy and the so called coming one world government
3846657 according to the f b i mr fazul headed the kenya cell of al qaeda the terror network founded by osama bin laden an exiled saudi businessman it says mr fazul rented the room where the bomb was assembled and drove the white pickup that guided it to the embassy
3846658 the bombings on aug 7 1998 were the first major al qaida attack on u s targets the alleged mastermind fazul abdullah mohammed has been on the run for years he apparently escaped a police raid on the kenyan coast last weekend
3846659 on thursday prime minister raila odinga said mohammeds recent escape shows the country remains at risk
3846660 we must leave no stone unturned in fighting the scourge of terrorism but at the same time unless we provide just solutions to political crises such as those in the middle east new extremists will continue be created
3846661 this weekend police on the kenyan coast said they narrowly missed catching one of them fazul abdullah mohammed after he slipped back over the border for medical treatment in malindi
3846662 extremely disturbing statements on issues which it is clear he was very poorly informed and on which he chose to lecture the government and the people of kenya on how to manage our country
3846663 he too recalled barry coming to the prayer room wearing a sarong he
3846664 obama needed a christian church in order to succeed in chicago politics he selected trinity because it best matched his personal and political feelings then he dumped the entire relationship when it got in the way of his presidential ambitions
3846665 raila odingas politics like the politics of his father odinga odinga are on the far left raila odinga was educated at the technical university in magdeburg in east germany where he graduated in 1970 with a degree in mechanical engineering there he heard fidel castro lecture and he named his first born son fidel on july 31 1982 junior military men of the luo tribe in the kenyan air force led a coup against president daniel arap moi but it failed for his suspected involvement in the coup raila odinga was arrested charged with treason and incarcerated without trial for nine years he was released in february 1988 and then rearrested in september 1988 this time for involvement with the clandestine kenya revolutionary movement and for facilitating travel to libya for kenyans seeking to get military training under colonel muammar qaddafi
3846666 obama visited kenya while president kibaki was locked in a presidential election contest with raila odinga during his visit the kibaki administration objected that odinga was using obamas visit to win votes obamas repeated public appearances with odinga and his almost daily criticism of the kibaki government added to the kibaki administrations dismay at how the u s senator conducted himself in their country
3846667 the channel 2 news team also interviewed on camera kenyan government
3846668 i think obama has to look critically where he is receiving his
3846669 what appears documented by kenyan newspaper and television news reports is that raila odinga representing the orange democratic movement or odm and sheikh abdullah abdi the chairman of the national muslim leaders forum or namlef signed an agreement on august 29 2007
3846670 in return odinga promised that within six months of becoming president

3846673 by supporting odinga senator obama is also seen in kenya as siding with the extreme left wing of kenyan politics going back to the overt communism of odinga odinga odingas current party the orange democratic movement or odm is a leftist socialist political party that stops short of being openly communist

3846682 analysis shows that a relation always social determines its terms and not the reverse and that each individual is a locus in which an incoherent and often contradictory plurality of such relational determinations interact
3846683 the making in question is a production a poiesis but a hidden one because it is scattered over areas defined and occupied by systems of production television urban development commerce etc and no longer leaves consumers any place in which they can indicate what they make or do with the products of these systems
3846684 i call a strategy the calculus of force relationships which becomes possible when a subject of will and power a proprietor an enterprise a city a scientific institution can be isolated from an environment a strategy assumes a place that can be circumscribed as proper and thus serve as the basis for generating relations with an exterior distinct from it competitors adversaries clienteles or targets or objects of research political economic and scientific rationality has been constructed on this strategic model

3846686 in forgetting the collective inquiry in which he in inscribed in isolating the object of his discourse form its historical genesis an author in effect denies his real situation he creates the fiction of a place of his own
3846687 the exceptional indeed cancerous development of panoptic procedures seems to be indissociable from the historical role to which they have been assigned that of being a weapon to be used in combating and controlling heterogeneous practices beneath what one might call the monotheistic privilege that panoptic apparatuses have won for themselves a polytheism of scattered practices survives dominated but not erased by the triumphal success of one of their number
3846688 taking a trick strategy involves both the postulates that determine a playing spaces and the rules that accord a value to the deal and certain options to the player in short an ability to maneuver within the different conditions in which the initial capital is committed
3846689 this genesis implies an interiorization of structures through learning and an exteriorization of achievements what bordieu calls habitus in practices a temporal dimension is thus introduced practices expressing the experience correspond adequately to situations manifesting the structure if and only if the structure remains stable for the duration of the process of interiorization exteriorization if not practices lag behind thus resembling the structure at the preceding point the point at which it was interiorized by habitus
3846690 one fundamental difference distinguishes them in narration it is no longer a question of approaching a reality as closely as possible and making the text acceptable through the real that it exhibits on the contrary narrated history creates a fictional space it moves away from the real or rather it pretends to escape present circumstances
3846691 the turn or inversion that leads the operation from its point of departure less force to its destination more force implies first of all the mediation of a body of knowledge but a peculiar one whose characteristics are the duration of its acquisition and its composition as an unending summation of particular fragments
3846692 it is a memory whose attainments are indissociable from the time of their acquisition and bear the marks of its particularities drawing its knowledge from a multitude of events among which it moves without possessing them they are all past each at a loss of place but a fragment of time it also computes and predicts the multiple paths of the future by combining antecedent or possible particularities
3846693 the structure of the miracle has a similar form out of another time from a time that is alien arises a god who has the characteristics of memory that silent encyclopedia of singular acts and who in religious stories represents with such fidelity the popular memory of those who have no place but who have time
3846694 more than that memory derives its interventionary force from its very capacity to be altered unmoored mobile lacking any fixed position its permanent mark is that it is formed by arising from the other and by losing it there is a double alteration both of memory which works when something affects it and of its object which is remembered only when it has disappeared memory is in decay when it is no longer capable of this alteration it constructs itself form events that are independent of it and it is linked to the expectation that something alien to the present will or must occur

3846745 prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
3846746 by aggregating pages across a huge number of not well vetted sites advertisers had little or no control over where their messages ran or if they appeared on inappropriate content so advertisers placed minimal value on networks as a whole or were simply unwilling to run messages on them
3846747 as the number of ad networks has increased so too has the degree of specialization in the category
3846748 but the basic concept aggregating impressions across sites so that marketers have an easier way to reach consumers and take advantage of better targeting has remained the same
3846749 the web is fragmenting and to capitalize on that you need a vertical ad network that has expertise in the specific area you want to reach whether its travel an ethnic group say hispanics or sports because they know where and how to reach these people without being intrusive
3846750 lots of up and coming companies can afford ad networks because many work for all scales of businesses

3846785 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3846786 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3846787 there is no doubt that fadel shanas death is a tragedy
3846788 a journalist in action was killed by idf fire along with others not involved in the hostilities
3846789 however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehaviour i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3846790 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3846791 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3846792 long line of cases clearing its soldiers of deadly negligence
3846793 the army is obligated to clearly identify its targets before firing especially in areas where civilians and journalists are present the mere suspicion of possible hostilities should not be enough to justify overwhelming deadly force
3846794 we hope that the armys conclusion does not appear to give soldiers free licence to fire without being sure of the target greatly hindering the medias ability to cover the conflict
3846795 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable
3846796 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected

3846808 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
3846809 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
3846810 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
3846811 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
3846812 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
3846813 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
3846814 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
3846815 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

3846823 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3846824 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3846825 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3846826 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3846827 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3846828 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3846829 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3846830 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3846831 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3846832 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3846833 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3846834 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3846835 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3846836 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3846837 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3846838 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3846839 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3846840 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3846841 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3846842 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3846843 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions

3846845 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3846846 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand

3846848 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it

3846850 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3846851 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3846852 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3846853 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3846854 i have to be careful because sometimes hell do a fast movement or run

3846858 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3846859 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3846860 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3846861 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3846862 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3846863 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3846864 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3846865 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench

3847074 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
3847075 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible

3847179 the assertion that all these assets necessarily would flow back onto banks balance sheets is not completely true in reality the criteria for keeping such assets off balance sheet simply would become extremely tough to meet while retention of some kind of explicit or implicit interest in a qualified special purpose entity as is commonplace would give stronger grounds for deeming that consolidation is advisable under the new regulations

3847200 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3847201 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward

3847206 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3847207 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance

3847210 according to the f b i mr fazul headed the kenya cell of al qaeda the terror network founded by osama bin laden an exiled saudi businessman it says mr fazul rented the room where the bomb was assembled and drove the white pickup that guided it to the embassy
3847211 the bombings on aug 7 1998 were the first major al qaida attack on u s targets the alleged mastermind fazul abdullah mohammed has been on the run for years he apparently escaped a police raid on the kenyan coast last weekend
3847212 on thursday prime minister raila odinga said mohammeds recent escape shows the country remains at risk
3847213 we must leave no stone unturned in fighting the scourge of terrorism but at the same time unless we provide just solutions to political crises such as those in the middle east new extremists will continue be created
3847214 this weekend police on the kenyan coast said they narrowly missed catching one of them fazul abdullah mohammed after he slipped back over the border for medical treatment in malindi
3847215 extremely disturbing statements on issues which it is clear he was very poorly informed and on which he chose to lecture the government and the people of kenya on how to manage our country
3847216 he too recalled barry coming to the prayer room wearing a sarong he
3847217 obama needed a christian church in order to succeed in chicago politics he selected trinity because it best matched his personal and political feelings then he dumped the entire relationship when it got in the way of his presidential ambitions
3847218 raila odingas politics like the politics of his father odinga odinga are on the far left raila odinga was educated at the technical university in magdeburg in east germany where he graduated in 1970 with a degree in mechanical engineering there he heard fidel castro lecture and he named his first born son fidel on july 31 1982 junior military men of the luo tribe in the kenyan air force led a coup against president daniel arap moi but it failed for his suspected involvement in the coup raila odinga was arrested charged with treason and incarcerated without trial for nine years he was released in february 1988 and then rearrested in september 1988 this time for involvement with the clandestine kenya revolutionary movement and for facilitating travel to libya for kenyans seeking to get military training under colonel muammar qaddafi
3847219 obama visited kenya while president kibaki was locked in a presidential election contest with raila odinga during his visit the kibaki administration objected that odinga was using obamas visit to win votes obamas repeated public appearances with odinga and his almost daily criticism of the kibaki government added to the kibaki administrations dismay at how the u s senator conducted himself in their country
3847220 the channel 2 news team also interviewed on camera kenyan government
3847221 i think obama has to look critically where he is receiving his
3847222 what appears documented by kenyan newspaper and television news reports is that raila odinga representing the orange democratic movement or odm and sheikh abdullah abdi the chairman of the national muslim leaders forum or namlef signed an agreement on august 29 2007
3847223 in return odinga promised that within six months of becoming president
3847224 re write the constitution of kenya to recognize sharia as the only true law sanctioned by the holy quran for muslim declared regions
3847225 jonsson ny sun sees the recent events in kenya as signaling the
3847226 by supporting odinga senator obama is also seen in kenya as siding with the extreme left wing of kenyan politics going back to the overt communism of odinga odinga odingas current party the orange democratic movement or odm is a leftist socialist political party that stops short of being openly communist
3847227 we have to ask whether obama by supporting odinga openly in kenya lent his name also to endorse odingas leftist politics and odingas alliance with radical muslims pushing islam in kenya
3847228 if youre so smart how come you are not rich
3847229 the river was swollen muddy and visibility was very poor
3847230 ambulance fire police rnli coastguards a wide range of people all turned up
3847231 my fathers called jim and he did this thing called jim will fix it where he tried to help people with kids who were ill or do something special for them
3847232 and when i was about 5 this little boy who was ill wanted to ride a motorbike and they got this little tiny honda monkey bike as it was called and the kid rode it all around the field i was there so i asked if i could have a shot afterwards and i think its true to say i never got over the feeling of going like that on the bike its a thrill that i still have to this day
3847233 every time my parents came down to visit i would hide all my bike stuff my helmet and my gloves and jacket up in this girls flat upstairs
3847234 until a year or two went by and then i went mom dad look
3847235 ninety eight percent of the time we met really really friendly enthusiastic people who helped us out we were in some very very poor areas of the world and we found like on long way round that when you are with people who really have very little they are sometimes the most generous people you are ever likely to meet
3847236 and being on a motorcycle the landscape changes roundabout you in a way that really makes you feel that you belong there
3847237 it was like every single surface of road mixed in every three seconds sand rock gravel sand water mud
3847238 there was nothing that resembled anything nice to ride on it was awful for days it was great in retrospect but there was moments doing it where youd like to have been somewhere else
3847239 people are slightly subconsciously probably sympathetic towards you because they understand if its cold you are going to be really cold if its wet you are going to be wet you have no protection from the elements therefore as a traveler people kind of look after you when youre on a bike
3847240 she rode 1 500 miles in about seven days as we rode down lake malawi and then across the whole of zambia when we got to victoria falls we said goodbye to each other and she flew back home and i went down to cape town it was fantastic i was so proud of her for having got to the point where she rode really really well and it was just lovely to be sharing this ive been married to my wife for almost 13 years and shes never expressed any interest to ride a motorcycle and there i was riding along behind her with africa all around us it was beautiful
3847241 my mom thought that she didnt have to worry about me i was mainly wearing makeup for a living you know and then suddenly i went oh mom im riding my bike around the world and she goes oh my god what did i do to deserve all of this worry but they both know that i love it and that it is enriching and that we put out stuff that encourages people to think about the world as an accessible place and thats important i think
3847242 the take home message here is its a big deal
3847243 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
3847244 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
3847245 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
3847246 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
3847247 positive thoughts come from faith negative thoughts from doubt the friendly work environment 16
3847248 obviously theres a lot of belt tightening going on and many car buyers are holding off on a purchase they expected to make this summer
3847249 theyre pushing it off until winter or next year so manufacturers are cutting or slashing production but they still have a pretty hefty supply of vehicles on hand
3847250 the cars were not for sale but simply being hidden
3847251 its anything fuel and space efficient as well as hybrids
3847252 you need to research the vehicle from a cost of ownership perspective
3847253 you may pay a little more on your monthly payment on a car with a lower cost of ownership
3847254 but it will reward you over the course of the five or six years youre financing the vehicle
3847255 a lot of production changes just happened but the units sitting on lots are still there the model changeover season doesnt take place until the fall and by that time the 2008 models will be looking pretty dusty
3847256 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
3847257 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
3847258 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect
3847259 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something
3847260 ive had two bikes stolen so i stopped buying bikes because they kept stealing them

3847264 on march 06 2008 signature days a company i founded sadly went into bankrupcy
3847265 this is not going to end well although signature days is currently not out of money it probably would be by the summer while we still had some assets and some cash in the bank the right thing to do would be to file for chapter 7 bankruptcy and allow the courts to distribute the leftovers in an efficient and legally equitable way
3847266 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3847267 do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3847268 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3847269 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3847270 about 10 years ago the energy industry was in a slump and then when williams field built their second plant and enterprise products partners lp came in and all this oil and gas cycling came through our business went way up
3847271 so i pay an extra 200 bucks every two weeks for groceries for the same stuff i always buy were barely making it
3847272 you did everything you could chandler told deitchler who had just lost his second match in the olympic greco roman wrestling tournament
3847273 i was wrestling that guy 15 minutes ago he said to his father jason
3847274 i gave it my all and did everything i could to prepare said deitchler who finished in 12th place
3847275 ill learn from this and move on i want to be good enough that i dont put myself in that position again to be the best in the world is the goal
3847276 youve got to score points to win such a tough tournament said paulson a 1996 olympic silver medalist in greco
3847277 i really thought he couldnt lose in the third period the guy had great defense
3847278 deitchler prepared as best he could he did everything he was supposed to do its disappointing to come and have him not get what he wanted but im not disappointed in him he tried his best
3847279 kid dynamite printed on the back waved u s flags and handmade signs supporting deitchler jason deitchler was particularly saddened to see his son lose
3847280 i know how much it meant to him and how much he worked its my job as a dad to go back and say we came here to experience this with you to watch you and support you win lose or draw
3847281 i wish it would have turned out better but if i know jake itll be something that drives him this will eat at him for four years his attitude will be ill come back and ill prove that i belong
3847282 when you work really hard and give your all and you lose it hurts jake said
3847283 it will motivate me to work harder than a lot of people and find a way to be the best
3847284 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country

3847295 i have absolutely no idea what has really happened or why it is inconceivable that we could have signed any agreement with zanu pf without the tsvangirai group also signing since we have been negotiating as one team since july last year
3847296 i guess the lie is probably our most popular song perhaps because we open our set with it
3847297 the olympics is a singular event because of its scale and because of the number of people who will consume it over 17 days so it will magnify the use of every platform
3847298 we had to figure out how to measure ourselves across all platforms
3847299 this is not to make nielsen numbers bigger but to understand a new media world
3847300 ill be happy when tami goes out of business because itll mean one company has found a way to measure all this stuff
3847301 i have no idea how people will use the internet on the olympics
3847302 its never been used to the scale we have now
3847303 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3847304 bushs speech said nothing of how georgia was armed all these years including by the united states
3847305 we have more than once warned our partners that this is a dangerous game it the bush speech said nothing about what had happened on aug 8 when western leaders maintained silence when tskhinvali became a target of massive bombing
3847306 the cea cnet indexes provide market observers a new metric on the economy and the first of its kind metric to gauge the on going health of the consumer technology sector
3847307 by eliciting subjective probabilities the indexes are better at capturing consumers attitudes and feelings about the economy
3847308 results from the cea cnet indexes are consistent with what we are seeing elsewhere spending on consumer technologies remains a priority for consumers despite the overhanging economic uncertainty
3847309 consumer electronics have become an indispensable part of peoples lives and a major factor in the health of the u s economy
3847310 were thrilled to be partnering with cea to bring these indexes to the industry for the first time we have a tool that allows economists and business leaders to track a sector that is expected to exceed 173 billion in u s factory sales this year
3847311 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3847312 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3847313 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
3847314 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
3847315 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
3847316 things that would have seemed fantastic 15 years ago are now routine
3847317 we have to rethink what is a reasonable expectation of privacy
3847318 many years ago when i was a college student i took a course from john kenneth galbraith on the first day of class professor galbraith gave a brilliant opening lecture after which the students gave him a standing ovation galbraith kept on giving brilliant opening lectures the whole semester but instead of standing ovations there were now dwindling numbers of students and some of them got up and walked out in the middle of his lectures galbraith never got beyond the glittering generalities that marked his first lecture after a while the students got tired of not getting any real substance senator barack obamas campaign this year reminds me very much of that course from professor galbraith
3847319 experience has shown that the government typically collected more revenue from a lower capital gains tax rate than from a higher rate

3847421 oh absoluut soms lijkt het of ik een luchtbel zit aangedreven door een heilig vuur begin ik te werken en ik moet dan vooral totaal afgesloten van de wereld zijn ik zou eigenlijk altijd moeten werken om volledig rustig te zijn
3847422 wel hoe meer ik werk en vooral hoe inge wikkelder de structuren en patronen worden hoe meer ik naar een meditatieve staat toe werk zo probeer ik mezelf ook uit te dagen door het steeds ingewikkelder te ma ken de herhaling van patronen en handelingen helpt daar ook bij op het moment dat ik zo met mijn werk bezig ben ben ik ook compleet weg van deze wereld
3847423 ik vindt het nogal moeilijk om te zeggen ik ben boeddhist in mijn dagelijkse leven ben ik zeker geen boeddhist ik kan me bijvoorbeeld verschrikkelijk op winden in het verkeer mijn kinderen en mijn vrouw moeten altijd lachen als ik beweer dat ik het w l ben maar de filosofie spreekt me wel erg aan en zouden we trouwens niet allemaal graag verlicht willen zijn dan kunnen we dit leven af sluiten en hoeven we nooit meer in een andere gedaante terug te komen
3847424 ik denk dat dit te maken heeft met heel veel ervaring lacht en geduld nee mijn manier van werken is met lagen te werken ik schilder eerst een laag met acryl verf en daarna schilder ik er nog n bovenop en iedere laag die ik zet bedekt nooit volledig de vorige laag je vertrekt ook van een witte ondergrond en dat wit licht probeer ik te behouden of er door te laten komen
3847425 ja maar vaak heeft het ook te maken met toeval toeval kan heel interessant zijn je moet het alleen kunnen inzien en ze herkenen en bovendien weet ik wat ik ga schilderen net als alle andere schilders in de wereld eigenlijk schildert iedereen met een concept niemand klad zomaar wat op een doek en ziet wat er van komt
3847426 toen ik men cataloog voorstelde in het mukha in antwerpen vond marl ne dumas zuid afrikaanse schilderes red dat ik bij de symbolisten hoorde en dat klopt wel om dit te bewijzen gaf ze me een kopie uit een boek over de belgische symbolisten van de vorige eeuw mensen als f licien rops en gustav murreaux en ik weet nog toen ik hier juist aankwam in belgi dat ik naar parijs geweest ben voor zijn huis dat veranderde in een museum en ik was daar werkelijk kapot van de symbolisten werken zeer veel patroonmatig en als er figuren in voor komen hebben ze meestal hun ogen gesloten of een blik die naar binnen is gericht deze kenmerken komen ook in mijn werken vaak voor en natuurlijk ook echt symbolisch een ingepakt hart is bijvoorbeeld een symbool voor verdriet
3847427 ik heb eigenlijk geluk dat ik me nooit vergelijk met andere mensen ik benijdt ze er niet om ik denk dat er toch ook veel negatieve kanten aan de faam zitten die ik niet echt wil ik kan hun eigenlijk alleen maar toe applaudisseren het is ook niet echt mijn verlangen of intentie om beroemd te worden

3847433 the pain and anxiousness that family members feel when their loved one is injured wounded or lost in combat cannot be overstated at times like these military families deserve some time and space even if they are candidates for office it wouldnt kill ozinga to show some class by wishing ms halvorson and her stepson well and laying off the attacks for a couple of days its just a simple sign of respect to do so when your opponent is going through a time like this
3847434 capt jay bush was apparently being fired on in afghanistan when he abandoned his vehicle in the dark and fell 25 feet off a bridge and onto some rocks

3847458 the trouble with the financial service industry is that it focuses on the top 5 percent to 10 percent of the population but for the 95 percent of people who earn less than the social security wage base the amount of income that is subject to social security tax which was 102 000 this year there are things more important than what fund to pick

3847474 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3847475 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3847476 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3847477 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3847478 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3847486 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3847487 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3847488 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3847489 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3847509 ik ben zeker ontgoocheld ja we lagen de hele eerste set boven hebben kansen gehad en hadden zelfs een setpunt als je constant leidt en je verliest de set dan toch dan krijg je een morele klap en wordt de rest van de wedstrijd nog harder het doet gewoon pijn om op zon manier te verliezen tegen zon goed duo maar we hebben twee goede wedstrijden gespeeld hier dus dat is positief voor de toekomst we hebben dit jaar amper kunnen samenspelen in mijn wedstrijd tegen gonzalez had ik niet de indruk slecht gespeeld te hebben hij speelde gewoon super
3847510 er zijn wel een pak positieve dingen te onthouden van het toernooi hier in peking het was in het algemeen een leuke ervaring ik had ook een goed spelgevoel hier ik heb goede wedstrijden gespeeld en het was tof om nog eens met steve te kunnen spelen ik heb bijvoorbeeld ook voor de eerste keer kunnen winnen van minar we hadden in het dubbel misschien nog beter kunnen doen maar we hebben echt alles gegeven
3847511 over de nederlaag in het enkelspel van olivier tegen gonzalez was ik niet ontgoocheld want dat was geen wedstrijd gonzalez was te sterk maar over dit dubbelspel wel ze hebben verschillende kansen gekregen om de eerste set binnen te halen maar ze hebben ze niet afgemaakt als ze die eerste set winnen is het een heel andere wedstrijd echt jammer want ze konden de russen aan
3847512 het is frustrerend dat we de kansen gemist hebben want we hebben een goede wedstrijd gespeeld ik ben nu ontgoocheld maar ik zal straks wel beseffen dat ik een superervaring meegemaakt heb het is een mooie week geweest

3847527 its not just music for the united states its world music
3847528 im touching so many different kinds of people on this album as well as keeping my core fan base at the same time
3847529 its totally given me a new energey a new everything
3847530 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
3847531 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
3847532 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
3847533 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3847534 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3847535 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3847536 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3847537 eva is desperately trying to get pregnant with husband tony parker
3847538 after they phone their doctor she promised me i will be the next call
3847539 tami was created not just for the olympics but it will be used for all our cross platform programming were starting out with the olympics because its such a huge event it provides a good jumping off point it measures exposure it is not a currency and were not selling off it its not an unduplicated reach no way to do that besides we want to measure duplication in fact the more duplication across platforms the better ill be happy when we can retire tami but until the industry adopts single source data but we couldnt wait for that
3847540 more data will be released later but so far half say they wanted to see what they missed 40 percent wanted to see events again by putting so much available online it allows us to catch to the way users watch on demand we feared in 2004 having seven networks it would be too much and dilute the main coverage on broadcast multiplatform has helped boost tv
3847541 these olympics are influencing how people are using new technology half of the people viewing on mobile are using it for the first time after the olympics it will be intersting if these habits become part of their behavior
3847542 a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
3847543 the events of the last few days show that there are many places in the world where we dont necessarily anticipate this kind of conflicts breaking out
3847544 and it does require a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
3847545 we also have to understand what this is about the centuries old ambitions of the russians to establish the russian empire
3847546 encouraging residents to apply for access to the heavily secured park
3847547 use it with your friends its cool only we can use it its fun and practical
3847548 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with apple and provides even greater differentiation from peers
3847549 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3847550 these low cost amplifying devices can look tempting to individuals with hearing impairment because of the significant cost differences
3847551 but our research found that the low cost aids generally dont meet the fitting requirements to help a hearing impaired person and could potentially damage a persons hearing
3847552 aside from being of extremely poor quality very low cost hearing aids those under 100 have the potential to damage your hearing because they send very loud sounds into the ear the studys mid range hearing aids 100 500 were of higher quality and were not considered a safety hazard
3847553 based on the research the best advice for consumers is to talk to an audiologist because hearing aids have complex technical features they need to be fitted and customized to the individual
3847554 currently more than 32 million people have a hearing impairment yet only about 25 percent of those use hearing aids
3847555 meanwhile the aging population is growing and hearing loss becomes more common as we become older
3847556 would it be wrong if we asked people to pray for rain
3847557 not just rain abundant rain torrential rain urban and small stream flood advisory rain
3847558 not flood people out of their houses rain just good ol swamp the intersections rain
3847559 the building operates well at the current capacity the seats beneath the tarps dont provide the experience we expect to deliver to our fans
3847560 i dont think that were going to have that kind of situation
3847561 but i do believe that we need to stand as courageously as we can on behalf of this little country
3847562 alaska is the state where he needs to reside during this falls election season
3847563 the government does not dispute that senator stevens business during an election season is his campaign for re election
3847564 the artwork for our next cd tentatively titled reflections from the other side is complete over the past month artist eliran kantor known for his work on several covers but recently for his work on the recent testament cd formation of damnation has put together something really dark and eerie and just absolutely impressive for our next cd sometime in the next several months we will post the artwork on our myspace but as a sneak preview so it will only be up for just for a day or two
3847565 squats deadlifts chin ups the bench press or maybe something out of the box but obvious like walking something weird and counterintuitive like meditation the suspense is killing us mr fitness guy

3847577 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
3847578 with my fan base being broader and larger now im looking to somewhere where somebody can really take advantage of that and take it to the next level
3847579 die kirche christi die arche noah des neuen bundes kann nicht untergehen auch in den letzten tagen nicht denn sie wird von solchen nieten zusammengehalten die niemandes denken auseinander bringen kann

3847582 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3847583 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3847584 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3847585 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3847586 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3847587 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3847588 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem

3847592 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
3847593 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3847594 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3847595 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3847596 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
3847597 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
3847598 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3847599 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think lee harvey oswald is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a conspiracy theory
3847600 ive seen the theories that he was a pawn like lee harvey oswald thats going to be hard to disprove
3847601 how do you disprove that a dead man was not a puppet being manipulated by the cia youre talking about proving a negative you cant prove aliens didnt mail the letters

3847604 das h tte drave am 4 12 2008 vorlesen sollen bemerkung bez lt weine war der sekret r des stammapostel bischoffs zitate aus der akte kuhlen zitat es musste seit monaten auffallen dass in der zeitschrift unsere familie bei berichten ber gottesdienste die der stammapostel gehalten und denen ich mitgedient hatte meine ausf hrung entweder nur zu einem ganz kleinen teil oder nur mit einem allgemeinen satz oder sogar absolut nicht erw hnt wurden obwohl es bisher sogar immer der fall war wenn an einem platze wo der stammapostel gottesdienste gehalten einer der apostel mitgearbeitet dann erschien in dem bericht hier ber in unserer familie wenigsten auch etwas ber die ausf hrungen des mitdienenden apostels im juni 1950 war der stammapostel mit allen europ ischen aposteln in holland wo er drei sehr gro e gottesdienste hielt in allen drei gottesdiensten habe ich gem der bitte des stammapostels mehr zeit im dienen ausgef llt als gew hnlich und hat der stammapostel weniger gesprochen als sonst weil selbst der holl ndischen sprache nicht m chtig ist und ich in holl ndisch zu den versammelten reden sollte aber in dem ber die drei gro en in holland gehaltenen dienste in unsere familie erschienenen bericht ist noch nicht einmal mit einem worte erw hnt worden dass ich berhaupt in holland mitgedient habe die wahrscheinlich vorhandene sorge ich k nnte zu sehr in den vordergrund ger ckt werden war wirklich unberechtigt denn danach stand mein sinn absolut nicht der stammapostel war also so weit gekommen dass er offen sagte er habe keinen helfer n tig und ein nachfolger k me f r ihn nicht in frage die wirklichkeit war freilich dass er sich immer mehr eines anderen mannes als helfer bediente und zwar in mancherlei wichtigen angelegenheiten die der stammapostel inoffiziell mit jenem manne berlegte und erledigte ich habe dann eines tages vertraulich mit dem bezirks ltesten weine gesprochen ber alle meine feststellungen und wahrnehmungen und ihn gebeten mir offen zu sagen ob es nicht ratsam sei das ich als stammapostelhelfer und nachfolger des stammapostels zur cktreten solle darauf hat bezirks ltester weine ganz entschieden gesagt dass ich einen solchen schritt auf keinen fall tun d rfe weil das werk dann sicher ganz absinken und g nzlich menschenwerk werden w rde ich m chte doch aushalten solange ich k nne es war jedoch immer offensichtlich dass radikal darauf hingearbeitet wurde dass ich als stammapostelhelfer und nachfolger des stammapostels verschwinden m sse so war es f r mich auch nichts berraschendes sondern lediglich lange bef rchtet dass in dem vom verlag friedrich bischoff f r das jahr 1951 erschienenen kalender der den aposteln in der 2 novemberh lfte 1950 zugestellt wurde ein direkter angriff gegen meine stellung im werke zu lesen war in diesem artikel wurde offen ausgesprochen dass der herr dem stammapostel berhaupt noch keinen nachfolger gezeigt h tte das war bewusste arbeit durch welche eine aktion gegen mich ausgel st werden und durch fragen ber diese sache eine entscheidung herbeigef hrt werden sollte apostel dehmel sprach dann noch telefonisch mit apostel weinmann ber die angelegenheit der dann gegen ber apostel dehmel u erte das man jetzt vor der frage stehe wie einst bismark n mlich h lt man es mit dem alten kaiser dann verdirbt man es mit dem kronprinzen oder h lt man es mit dem kronprinzen dann verdirbt man es mit dem kaiser es gab gegen ber dem apostel dehmel unverhohlen seiner meinung ausdruck dass es von herrn s 14 meyer geweke unerh rt sei solches zu schreiben aber er wisse ja wenn einer der apostel etwas gegen fritz bischoff sagen w rde der verd rbe es mit dem stammapostel und mit stammapostel wolle er es auf keinen fall verderben apostel dehmel frug ihn dann ob es nicht ratsam sei einmal mit einigen aposteln zusammenzukommen und mit diesen zu beraten was man gegen solche quertreiberei tun k nne darauf sagte apostel weinmann tue das um himmels willen nicht denn das wird dir derart bel genommen dann bist du unten durch wir haben in dieser hinsicht doch so furchtbares erlebt dass uns die lust vergangen ist mit irgendwelchen aposteln ber solche dinge zu reden ich gehe glaube ich f r das n chste halbe jahr in ferien damit mich niemand erreicht und ich zu allem nichts sagen brauche ich habe dann den bezirks ltesten weine angerufen und ihn gefragt was der stammapostel zu diesem artikel gesagt h tte bez lt weine sagte mir dann dass der stammapostel tags zuvor morgens gesagt h tte er habe am abend vorher den neuen kalender bekommen und diesen artikel gelesen er habe eine schlaflose nacht gehabt und dar ber nachgegr belt was dieser artikel wohl ausl sen w rde er habe von diesem artikel erst erfahren als der kalender bereits im versand war er habe denselben vorher nicht gelesen er wollte ein schreiben an die apostel aufsetzen worin er denselben mitteilen w rde dass herr meyer geweke ohne sein wissen und ohne seinen willen derartiges geschrieben habe zwar habe er im jahre 1947 gesagt dass der herr ihm bis dahin noch keinen nachfolger gezeigt habe aber das sei ja inzwischen durch die vorgenommene handlung berholt dieses schreiben sollte dann den aposteln auf anfrage zugestellt werden damit sie solches den fragenden sagen k nnten ich wartete dann auf das schreiben des stammapostels das aber nicht kam wie ich es geahnt hatte denn ich wusste aus vieler erfahrung was die geister wollen und dass mit dem artikel im kalender ja eine bestimmte absicht verfolgt worden war ich rief dann nochmals beim bez ltesten weine an ob das schreiben des stammapostels noch nicht abgesandt sei au erdem habe der bez lteste fritz bischoff inzwischen mit den aposteln schmidt und weinmann telefoniert und dem stammapostel berichtet dass er mit diesen beiden aposteln gesprochen habe und dass diese den artikel in dem kalender ganz in ordnung befunden h tten inwieweit diese behauptung ber die aussagen der apostel schmidt und weinmann gegen ber dem sohn des stammapostels den tatsachen entsprechen kann ich nat rlich nicht sagen etliche tage danach rief ich wiederum beim bez lt weine an und frug wie die sache stehe er wollte mit aber dann absolut keine auskunft mehr geben und sagte nur wir hier vom b ro haben strikte anweisungen jedem apostel der etwa hier anrufen w rde zu erkl ren sie d rften ber nichts auskunft geben sondern sollten sich schriftlich an den stammapostel wenden ich wusste dann bereits sonnenklar dass die arbeit meiner beseitigung als nachfolger des stammapostels auf hochtouren lief und dass man den stammapostel mittlerweile g nzlich umgestimmt hatte deshalb drang ich bittend in den bez lt weine ein er m ge mir doch einen br derlichen rat geben was ich tun solle aber er wollte nicht mehr mit der s 15 sprache heraus er war sehr eingesch chtert und hatte direkt angst zu sprechen ich frug dann ganz eindringlich was denn jetzt los sei er m ge mir das doch sagen damit ich evtl den geistern zuvorkommen und von mir aus meinen r cktritt erkl ren k nnte dann hat bruder weine sich erweichen lassen mir zu sagen dass der sohn des stammapostels in dessen auftrag mehrere apostel nach frankfurt bestellt habe zu einer besprechung die zum ziele habe die am 1 august 1948 als eine in menschlicher gutmeinung vorgenommene handlung r ckg ngig zu machen dann frug ich weiter ob er denn glaube dass die bestellten apostel dann frug ich weiter ob er denn glaube dass die bestellten apostel ja sagen w rden darauf sagte er ganz kleinlaut leider muss ich das als sicher annehmen au erdem sagte er mir dass der stammapostel inzwischen derart mit der ansicht seines sohnes bereinstimme dass es f r die folge wohl unm glich w re dass noch einmal ein ersprie liches zusammenarbeiten zwischen dem stammapostel und mir als stammapostelhelfer stattfinden k nnte dann habe ich bruder weine gebeten tun sie mir bitte noch einen liebesdienst und gehen noch einmal hin zum stammapostel und sagen ihm er m ge mir und sich selbst die unannehmlichkeit einer wahrscheinlich sehr bitteren auseinandersetzung ber die angelegenheit im apostelkreise und auch dem volke gottes diese trag die ersparen ich w re bereit von mir aus wieder auf meine ausgangsstellung als bezirksapostel zur ckzutreten und das amt als stammapostelhelfer und nachfolger im stammapostelamte zur ckzugeben ich erkl rte auch dass ich mit dem stammapostel unbedingt eine pers nliche aussprache haben wollte und dass ich dem stammapostel versichere dass ich mich gar nicht erst mit ihm in eine diskussion ber die angelegenheit einlassen wolle dass ich aber unbedingt mit ihm in gutem einvernehmen leben m chte da ich nie und nimmer nach der krone strebte sondern einzig und allein selig werden wolle wobei es f r mich nebensache sei ob ich wieder nur als bezirksapostel in dem d sseldorfer bezirk schaffen k nne der stammapostel m ge doch so gut sein und mich andern morgens f r eine stunde zur regelung der angelegenheit empfangen bruder weine rief mich dann am gleichen abend noch an dass der stammapostel mich am andern morgen um 10 uhr empfangen wolle dass ich aber mein r cktrittsgesuch schriftlich mitbringen sollte dann w rde meine verabschiedung in allen ehren geschehen ich sagte dazu dass ich kein schreiben mitzubringen ged chte sondern erst den verlauf der unterredung mit dem stammapostel abwarten m chte und dann entsprechend dem hergang der unterredung in frankfurt das schreiben formulieren k nnte andern morgens fuhr ich dann mit apostel dehemel nach frankfurt oder richtiger gesagt nach canossa denn es war wahrhaftig ein canossagang bitterster art tiefster dem tigung f r mich es ist wohl verst ndlich dass sowohl apostel dehmel also auch ich w hrend der nacht vom 24 auf den 25 november 1950 jeder nur knapp eine stunde geschlafen hatten denn unz hlige gedanken jagten einander was wohl in dieser situation f r das werk gottes das richtige sei es zu einer offenen aussprache im apostelkollegium und damit zu einem kampfe zu einer reinigung kommen zu lassen oder ob es mehr zu verantworten sei zu schweigen wie k nnte man wohl vor gott und dem eigenen gewissen bestehen usw usw und diese qu lenden fragen und gedanken tauschten wir w hrend unserer fahrt nach frankfurt in aller gr ndlichkeit aus apostel dehmel hielt mir vor augen dass er der berzeugung sei s 17 dass der kampf um reinheit und sauberkeit im werke jetzt oder aber zu einem sp teren zeitpunkte so wie so k me dass es schlie lich ertr glicher w re ich w rde den schritt tun wie ich es vorhatte n mlich zur ckzutreten dass aber damit dem volke gottes wohl nicht so gedient w re nach allem hin und her kam denn auch ich zu dem entschluss dem stammapostel zu sagen dass ich nach reiflicher berlegung den r cktritt nicht einreichen k nnte weil damit dem werke schaden erwachse und dass ich unter umst nden auf der einberufung einer apostelversammlung best nde usw ich war dann auch fest entschlossen in aller ruhe aber auch in aller deutlichkeit mit dem stammapostel zu sprechen und ihm die gr nde daf r zu sagen warum ich nicht zur cktreten d rfe und k nne komme was da wolle so war mein und unser vorhabe aber als wir beim stammapostel waren wo bez lt anwesend war erlebten wir einen vulkanausbruch aus dem herzen des stammapostel wie er wohl von ihm noch ber keinen ergossen worden ist der stammapostel begann ruhig mit den worten sie wollen also von sich aus als stammapostelhelfer zur cktreten wie es gestern abend bruder weine gesagt haben ja sagte ich dazu bin ich bereit aber sie verzeihen mir wenn ich fragen m chte was habe ich denn nun eigentlich getan weiter kam ich nicht denn da der sprang stammapostel erregt auf und sprach nicht mehr sondern schrie und tobte sie was sie getan haben sie haben s mtliche apostel gegen mich aufgewiegelt sie sind hinter meinem r cken zu den aposteln gefahren und haben mich gezwungen die handlung damals vorzunehmen sie haben damals das schreiben aufgesetzt was die 15 apostel unterschrieben haben sie und apostel lembke sind hinter meinem r cken bei den aposteln gewesen ich m chte in der ewigkeit mal nicht in der haut des apostels lembke stecken ihr habt damals den demokratischen geist in die apostel gelegt und seid damit von der lehre abgewichen ich habe w hrend dieses wutausbruches bei dem der stammapostel auf den tisch schlug und bei dem die zornesadern auf seiner stirne standen g nzlich still geschwiegen denn das war apostel dehmel und mir klar dass bei erwiderungen zu diesen beschuldigungen des stammapostels derselbe wahrscheinlich vor erregung einen schlaganfall bekommen h tte und dann h tte man in die welt hinaus posaunt wir h tten den stammapostel auf dem gewissen so blieben wir beide g nzlich stille der stammapostel verlor jede haltung und verklagte in seinen weiteren ausf hrungen besonders den apostel e g ttinger mit seiner demokratischen gesinnung er habe aber k rzlich den schweizer aposteln bewiesen dass die damalige handlung ung ttlich gewesen sei denn der herr habe ihm eine offenbarung gegeben dass er das volk gottes zur vollendung f hren w rde er habe zu den schweizer aposteln gesagt und das wiederhole er auch uns gegen ber i c h w e r d e n i c h t s t e r b e n da h tten die schweizer apostel gro e augen gemacht aber w sste was er sagte und er bliebe auch dabei ich sagte dann noch leise lieber stammapostel habe ich mir denn s 18 etwa in meiner amtsf hrung als stammapostelhelfer etwas zu schulden kommen lassen das war schon zu viel denn wieder sprang der stammapostel auf und schrie stehen sie zu dem was sie gestern zu bruder weine gesagt haben und wollen sie zur cktreten sonst unterbreite ich die sache dem apostelkollegium und dann werden sie erleben dass die apostel welche damals f r sie waren heute gegen sie sind mit wenigen ausnahmen also bleiben sie dabei dass sie zur cktreten wollen sonnst und dann ging der zur t re womit klar war dass er und hinauswerfen w rde wenn ich nicht ja und amen sagte da jedoch eine sachliche aussprache g nzlich unm glich war und da es bei weiteren entgegnungen meinerseits zu einem offenen bruch kommen w re und da auch offensichtlich war dass ein ersprie liches arbeiten als stammapostelhelfer an der der stammapostels zuk nftig unm glich war so sagte ich denn dass ich zur cktr te als stammapostelhelfer und wieder wie fr her als bezirksapostel im d sseldorfer bezirke t tig sein m chte das war dann f r den stammapostel das erl sende wort und er wurde sofort wesentlich ruhiger er sagte dann ganz lieb zu mir wenn sie wieder nur als bezirksapostel arbeiten dann ist damit die damalige angelegenheit erledigt dann ist alles gut dann wird der herr mit ihnen sein weiter habe ich dann nochmals kurz gefragt habe ich denn in meiner amtsf hrung als stammapostelhelfer etwas verkehrt gemacht oder liegen sonst klagen gegen mich vor nein sonst ist gar nichts gegen sie vorliegend sagte da der stammapostel dann habe ich den stammapostel doch gebeten wenn ich irgend welche fehler gemacht haben sollte dann m ge er mir das vergeben und darauf sagte der stammapostel von herzen gerne und dann gab er mir einen kuss der stammapostel bat mich dann ins b ro auf der sofienstr 48 zu gehen und dort das schreiben mit meiner r cktrittserkl rung aufzusetzen er sagte noch sie sind ja herzkrank dann k nnen sie ja schreiben dass sie aus gesundheitsr cksichten zur cktreten ich ging dann mit dem bez lt weine und apostel dehmel zum b ro auf der sofienstr 48 um das schreiben zu formulieren welches ich danach an der stammapostel abgegeben habe als wir im b ro in der sofienstr 48 ankamen hatte der stammapostel schon mit dem dort t tigen hirten weiler telefoniert und ihm gesagt er m ge mir bestellen ich solle in das schreiben einf gen ich tr te deshalb zur ck weil ich zu der erkenntnis gekommen sei dass der stammapostel das werk gottes vollenden w rde

3847652 republicans believe that any decision to spend 8 billion should be made by the legislature and we will fight hard to protect taxpayers
3847653 lawmakers were elected to make decisions about how the peoples hard earned tax dollars should be spent

3847666 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3847667 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3847668 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
3847669 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3847670 weve got a good sized rally but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago

3847700 when a straight man puts on a dress and gets his sexual kicks he is a transvestite when a man is a woman trapped in a mans body he gets a little operation and hes a transsexual and when a gay man has too much fashion sense for one gender he is a drag queen and when a little latin boy puts on a dress he is simply a boy in a dress
3847701 one thing ive always done is look into the dna of the company im working with whats the origin story
3847702 very often brands stop at the level of a products attributes or maybe they go to a products benefit but very rarely do they elevate us to that common ground of a real point of view something about the state of the world something that connects back to an ultimate human truth let me give an example if you were to talk about men and women you could say they are walking intelligent apes or you could say they are social emotional mammals or you could say they are driven by progress or by doing good one is about attributes one is about benefits one is about real point of view very few companies go to level three very few have a point of view that elevates the human race
3847703 if you want to tell stories tell stories very often people go through the process of writing a sales story but they dont really tell one instead they tell a strategy you should just tell the story if you try too hard you end up focusing too much on form and not enough on substance when you tell a story what do you do combine words and images write chapters think about the essence of storytelling going back to the dna add your point of view then tell it like it is you cant be too strategy driven
3847704 bring people along the best stories are those that go on and on and are modified and changed by people as they take ownership of those stories and bring them to life let people into your stories instead of dictating your stories to them

3847767 our focus during the quarter has been on the divestiture of ifires assets at the same time we have been considering all possible options for the longer term structure of the corporate organization moving forward
3847768 with due skill care and diligence and failing to organize and control their business effectively
3847769 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
3847770 it is imperative particularly in more challenging financial conditions that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks
3847771 in light of ongoing challenging capital markets mgi implemented cost reduction initiatives and decreased its capital market activities and operations during the quarter
3847772 as a result mgi incurred approximately 700 000 of non recurring expenses of which 600 000 related to compensation and benefits
3847773 this will provide our new aircraft with a proper maintenance base create additional employment opportunities and is another milestone in cargojets continued growth

3847787 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3847788 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3847789 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3847790 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3847791 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3847792 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3847793 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3847794 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3847795 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3847796 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3847797 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3847798 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3847799 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3847807 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3847808 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3847809 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3847810 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3847811 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms these are mature people who talk about things maturely
3847812 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3847813 this was one more effective way for us to communicate with folks who may not normally see other communications we have with voters who are paying closer attention to the race
3847814 it is a first i guess they are going after the insomniac vote
3847815 we have encountered unique and difficult market conditions in the first six months of 2008 the extreme price increases in petroleum and petrochemical prices has been unprecedented and has affected our sales and cost of sales we have passed on price increases to our customers however due to the rapid increase in oil prices there was a delay in being able to pass along increases to our customers which affected margins on a short term basis higher oil prices directly affect the discretionary spending on everything including recreational boating the decrease in recreational boating slowed the sales of our products at the retail level the company also experienced higher cost of freight in addition to material cost increases that adversely affected our gross margin percent of sales
3847816 despite all the negative economic factors endured in the second quarter of the year the company was able to break even we are cautiously optimistic as we enter the second half of the year as oil prices start to drop we believe as the industry picks up we will be the benefactor of increase sales due to our sales and marketing activities
3847817 to help americans use our health care resources more effectively providers must communicate clearly to their patients including the nearly one in two adults with low reading skills

3847828 the governor has this reputation throughout his entire public life of being noy only pro education having been a strong supporter of cfe and other initiatives throughout his career but also being pro labor

3847830 i think you know i like to have press conferences
3847831 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3847832 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
3847833 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
3847834 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
3847835 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
3847836 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
3847837 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
3847838 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
3847839 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
3847840 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
3847841 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
3847842 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
3847843 first mccain is garnering more support from his base including republicans and white evangelical protestants than he was in june and he also has steadily gained backing from white working class voters over this period secondly and more generally the arizona senator has made gains on his leadership image an even greater percentage of voters than in june now see mccain as the candidate who would use the best judgment in a crisis and an increasing percentage see him as the candidate who can get things done
3847844 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things
3847845 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
3847846 i am no longer in that relationship a lot of you keep asking me why my profile says single and why i seem sad lately so before you read it in some dumb article or online let me be the first to say it we broke up about 2 weeks ago we are still friends we are just trying to give each other some space i will always love him this is a hard time for both of us i thought being alone again was going to suck i think that is what kept me from breaking up a lot sooner
3847847 i am finding a new sense of freedom and empowerment it sounds corny but i feel like i can do anything i dont need to have someone in my life to make me feel complete
3847848 no what right i can give you a definite no on that in one word no in two words hell no

3847858 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3847859 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was
3847860 they said nothing about exclusively or how long maybe apple decides 350 million in convertible senior notes that could potentially dilute earnings if shares rose above the strike price of
3847861 while this does strengthen an important relationship with apple we remain cautious on consumer electronics heading into 2009 as slowing flat panel cycle pressured by falling price points mass competition and weaker consumer discretionary spending is likely to pressure specialty players
3847862 this is a cut throat business and having someone whos an expert at it is more important than the iphone contract
3847863 while we saw a drop in scores this year were happy to say that college readiness levels remain relatively the same
3847864 if the russians stop hostilities now they will have redrawn the whole strategic situation in the caucasus to the detriment of the americans
3847865 no one will invest in georgia in oil pipelines in new ventures there now the game is over in the new version of the great game the russians can cash in
3847866 at the moment it appears that russia will have gotten positive benefits from the use of force across its border
3847867 for medvedev the outcome is a war thats been won its his personal victory
3847868 the image of medvedev is the biggest casualty we and the west were hoping that russia at last had a young liberal reforming leader now after these events he comes off looking like a tough guy and there is an impression that hes totally dependent on putin
3847869 this moment could well mark the end of an era in europe during which realpolitik and spheres of influence were supposed to be replaced by new cooperative norms and a countrys right to choose its own path
3847870 while no one wants a return to cold war style confrontation moscows behavior poses a direct challenge to european and international order
3847871 a russia that has the means of force and is ready to use it spells a whole new situation
3847872 all neighboring countries will have to take this into account much depends on how russia behaves if it tries to dictate terms that will have a very negative effect but my impression is that russia was quite restrained and carefully calculated each move it seems likely that nato will be paralyzed
3847873 meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
3847874 moses wandered for 40 years and since king weve been lost and kind of wandering without direction for 40 years
3847875 my generation went through turbulent times in the 1960s that completely inverted the system we had grown up with im so proud of us i could pop we have been the generation in which the gate has swung 180 degrees my generation and doggone it im proud of what weve done
3847876 this shift this transition is what obamas appealing to the older you are the more difficult it is to get out of the older school when things are changing that fast but for the baby boom generation all of a sudden you have someone who arrives on the scene who can be a validation of what youre waiting for and holy mackerel i believe obama is that person its that desire to believe to have that desire validated
3847877 some people say i was just carried away by the moment but i said shoot im going to endorse obama
3847878 the reason im a democrat is that i was fortunate enough to hear kennedy speak at his inauguration when i was 13
3847879 he challenged us to go to the moon he didnt say how we were going to do it he said we need to go and god damn we did thats the beauty of someone with the ability to inspire
3847880 is very sensitive to not trying to alienate any of his republican support
3847881 we want peace for the rest of our lives and for future generations
3847882 but there is of course another way of looking at this years striking generation gap that john mccain has an age problem of his own and arguably a much bigger one than obama
3847883 if there is a cleavage in the generational landscape the polls suggest it is less between the youngest and the middle aged than it is between over 65 voters and everybody else and especially the now approaching retirement baby boomers
3847884 remember when we were young in college we were liberals way left now were so much more conservative we would appall our former selves
3847885 way back in the days when the grass was still green
3847886 rising food prices and some real concerns about our ability to supply food to countries such as india and china as their wealth increases raise the question of how nz and its food growing should be positioned to do the best that we can
3847887 we need to using all the resources that weve got to make sure were going as fast as we can
3847888 how many times do i have to see your ugly face
3847889 its amazing to swim in the same pool with him every time he steps up a record goes down
3847890 how many times do i have to see your ugly face
3847891 its amazing to swim in the same pool with him every time he steps up a record goes down
3847892 because some men arent looking for anything logical like money they cant be bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just want to watch the world burn
3847893 you cant swim forever or youll get sick in your head youre like a male bee they live for one moment then they die you only get recognition every four years

3847904 na minha sele o n o existe titular ou reserva n o um jogo que vai fazer o jogador ser titular o importante saber os jogadores com quem podemos contar

3847912 we improved each game and the bond and chemistry we developed as players in such a short amount of time is something special

3847943 yo le comentaba a la directiva lo importante que es viajar en avi n ahora me han confirmado que nos vamos en avi n eso me lo dijeron el s bado por la noche pero pens que les hab a ganado la emoci n es por lo que nos jugamos si nosotros ganamos estar amos tres puntos alejados de tigres y descansar y mantenernos en la pelea para despu s recibir a durango y a indios y sacarle provecho a la local a
3847944 yo siempre pienso en el primer lugar yo se los dije que con quien vamos a pelear ac es con correcaminos durango que me disculpen monterrey y los dem s equipos pero yo creo que entre esos equipos va a estar la pelea por los dos lugares para la calificaci n es agradable por supuesto y m s que perdi monterrey ahora los partidos son m s complicados pero gallos blancos est empezando a conocerse m s
3847945 es motivante el hecho de que tengas al l der de goleo y ser el equipo m s goleador pero hay que buscar balancear que tengamos la mejor defensiva es motivante para los muchachos
3847946 yo creo que s tambi n hay que ver en qu momentos hay que proponer por ejemplo cuando cay el 4 1 me dije por qu le vamos a regalar a tampico algo que no ha hecho por merec rselo con todo respeto para tampico el equipo arriesg cuando ten amos que arriesgar y todav a hicimos un gol m s yo creo que as se ganan los t tulos pero de repente habr formas en las que hay que modificar para sentirte mejor respaldado
3847947 according to snl kagan 2007 was a banner year for cable networks
3847948 industry revenue increased by 12 6 in 2007 to 38 billion ad revenue jumped 10 5 to 19 billion while license fees affiliate revenues soared almost 15 to more than 20 billion
3847949 despite the recent economic downturn snl kagan expects 2008 to be another strong year thanks mainly to license fees which result from long term contracts and provide cable networks with nearly half of their revenue

3847951 we do need to investigate the conditions of the people we need to know what they think and how they live
3847952 maoists following mao in this have to leave the comfort of reassuring illusions and misplaced authority we have to confront that here in the u s we have neither a vanguard organization nor the theoretical breakthroughs we need

3847954 and she raises a third concern that a revolutionary movement has to come from within the people that it cant approach the people as something
3847955 but the lack of roots is not the problem itself as if the rcp just chose not to go among the people and that we can solve this by just going there the lack of roots the lack of contact links cadre among the people is a result of the problem a symptom of the problem
3847956 and that is why it is valuable to uncover the actual accomplishments of the rcp

3847977 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
3847978 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome

3847989 i was back home 13 days i saw people at the grocery store at home depot at the fair and other places i have never seen anything like the issue of energy what people are saying is when they dont finish their work they stay late they want to know why congress doesnt stay and finish the job on energy
3847990 energy powers a nation it is the very core of our productivity the american way is to be more productive we have to be able to have the ability to access our own resources and not be held hostage by other countries
3847991 it might be a nice car but i keep telling people you cant tow a bale of hay in a prius
3847992 instead of sending money away lets keep that money here it would pay for our infrastructure and help answer our health care problems at the end of the day this is an american issue many of our troubles lead back to energy supply
3847993 the number one jet fuel user in the world is the us air force every dollar that oil goes up an additional 60 million is needed to fund the air force
3847994 we shouldnt be dependent on dysfunctional third world countries for our oil supply
3847995 conservation is important alternative fuels are important but also more domestic production is important you need all of it no one is suggesting you can drill your way out of this problem
3847996 people are always talking about a trade deficit well if you take away the money we are spending on importing oil we would be in a trade surplus
3847997 i want legislation that will allow companies to trade dry leases that wont produce for leases that are more likely to produce oil

3848000 hey bud whats your fear do you want kids to drink your beer
3848001 he was just spoiling eveyrthing he started ripping them off and said we were ruining his property and it was just a big mess
3848002 the whole thing makes the bud company look totally childish
3848003 our stickers say nothing about the consequences of alcohol they dont say dont buy beer they simply warn parents not to let their underage kids drink alcohol from their home
3848004 so we figure ok anheuser busch is thinking your sales loss will come from not having minors drink your alcohol
3848005 we live in a dangerous world we never know whats around the corner
3848006 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate who has not
3848007 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not between one candidate whos a talker and the other candidate whos the leader america needs

3848015 he was a young kid and they just wanted it to be over their feeling was that he will probably end up in trouble again and end up serving that time at the court they felt he was apologetic on that he was to go to jail but not for killing someone i dont know how you live with something like that
3848016 something tragic happens and there are people who take advantage of it and dont do their jobs they are responsible for taking care of those who didnt do anything wrong that sentence was a slap in the face david was a great person and its really sad theres no accountability no responsibility today the whole situation is unfortunate for what he took away i dont think 21 days is appropriate its a tragedy
3848017 we have to look at the defendant and his background and the facts of the case we consult with family members and make what we feel is an appropriate sentence the purpose of a sentence is rehabilitation punishment and deterrence

3848043 whats been great about the way the commission has organized this whole year has its been aimed at both looking backwards and being appreciative of the gifts that weve gotten from those that have come before us

3848050 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
3848051 he has two options to stay and fight or quit and go home
3848052 if he fights back we are with him we will support him and that is the preferred option
3848053 using that power would be undemocratic under the present circumstances even though it is in the constitution the democratic process should continue
3848054 we have the numbers and you have already seen the tidal wave against him musharraf in the provinces
3848055 if you guess wrong and go to the wrong place first you waste more time and it costs you extra in co pays and fees
3848056 independently we all were getting a little uncomfortable with the level of service that was being provided to the patients in the emergency room
3848057 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3848058 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3848059 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3848060 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3848061 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3848062 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3848063 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions

3848087 if you cant keep a promise to your family cant keep a promise to your wife youre having an affair youre lying about the affair repeatedly why should the american people trust you when you say youre not gonna lie to them why should we trust you
3848088 thats a great question sean asked amanda if thats true you cant trust somebody who had an affair how can we trust john mccain to be president of the united states since he cheated by his own admission on his first wife he didnt keep his marital vows he didnt keep his pledge to his first family
3848089 hannity pwns himself over john mccains own affair double standard eruption
3848090 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
3848091 there is no better illustration of everything that is wrong with washington than the john mccain vicki iseman tryst the republican chairman of the senate commerce committee carrying on with a comely female republican lobbyist who represents the corporate interests of other republicans with business before the committee and who donates to the chairmans campaigns wow
3848092 if she has nothing to hide i think she should come forward
3848093 why would we trust john edwards to uphold his oath of office as president when he betrayed his cancer stricken wife

3848110 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis
3848111 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
3848112 we have a lot in common we should get together sometime
3848113 my parents were both writers and my grandfathers were both writers of a kind both newspaper men my father wrote for television and films and my mother who is still alive is still producing lots of books it meant that we would all watch things on tv and analyze them and tear them apart which is good schooling it was also good to see that it was possible to get away with writing and make a living from it
3848114 i did nothing i would really say amounted to anything
3848115 i was worried i would end up trying to repeat it i tried doing something that went down a blind alley working on a novel for a while for which i did a lot of research but finding it was a bad idea then i started on the short stories which was about as opposite to a historical novel as you can get i was very keen on not writing historical fiction
3848116 for some insane reason my parents had hung onto my old school books from that time so i looked at those and the writing was helpful
3848117 that was one of the challenges to make it not too cute
3848118 i am very interested in going back to the historical but much further back than the victorians but still in rome i tend to do the research first and then see what seems interesting and where it might go
3848119 these days i tend to read non fiction that might throw up an idea i find i am getting more interested in things that are more diverse from science to history to geology i tend to get lead on by some idea that seems interesting something i have always wanted to know about and read a lot about it even so that if it does not go anywhere it feels satisfying
3848120 for someone who is starting out in writing i would say it is a very good thing to try to keep things simple especially at the beginning and try to make a lot happen try to keep imaginative possibilities coming along and in the end the book will sink or swim on structure and character

3848133 what influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society in some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries a just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it needs them not
3848134 as i understand the christian religion it was and is a revelation but how has it happened that millions of fables tales legends have been blended with both jewish and christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed
3848135 i almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved the cross consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced
3848136 the divinity of jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity nowhere in the gospels do we find a precept for creeds confessions oaths doctrines and whole cartloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in christianity
3848137 god is an essence that we know nothing of until this awful blasphemy is got rid of there will never be any liberal science in the world
3848138 this would be the best of all possible worlds if there were no religion in it
3848139 millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined imprisoned yet we have not advanced an inch towards uniformity what has been the effect of coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
3848140 it is too late in the day for men of sincerity to pretend they believe in the platonic mysticisms that three are one and one is three and yet that the one is not three and the three are not one but this constitutes the craft the power and the profit of the priests
3848141 gouverneur morris had often told me that general washington believed no more of that system christianity than did he himself
3848142 difference of opinion is advantageous in religion the several sects perform the office of a common censor over each other is uniformity attainable millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined imprisoned yet we have not advanced an inch towards uniformity what has been the effect of coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
3848143 i do not find in orthodox christianity one redeeming feature
3848144 it has been fifty and sixty years since i read the apocalypse and then i considered it merely the ravings of a maniac
3848145 i have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world and do not find in our particular superstition christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology
3848146 christianity neither is nor ever was a part of the common law
3848147 religious controversies are always productive of more acrimony and irreconcilable hatreds than those which spring from any other cause of all the animosities which have existed among mankind those which are caused by the difference of sentiments in religion appear to be the most inveterate and distressing and ought most to be depreciated i was in hopes that the enlightened and liberal policy which has marked the present age would at least have reconciled christians of every denomination so far that we should never again see the religious disputes carried to such a pitch as to endanger the peace of society
3848148 some books against deism fell into my hands it happened that they wrought an effect on my quite contrary to what was intended by them for the arguments of the deists which were quoted to be refuted appeared to me much stronger than the refutations in short i soon became a thorough deist
3848149 i wish it christianity were more productive of good works i mean real good works not holy day keeping sermon hearing or making long prayers filled with flatteries and compliments despised by wise men and much less capable of pleasing the deity
3848150 the way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason
3848151 whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and torturous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half of the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of god
3848152 what is it the new testament teaches us to believe that the almighty committed debauchery with a woman engaged to be married and the belief of this debauchery is called faith
3848153 take away from genesis the belief that moses was the author on which only the strange belief that it is the word of god has stood and there remains nothing of genesis but an anonymous book of stories fables and traditionary or invented absurdities or of downright lies
3848154 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
3848155 the study of theology as it stands in the christian churches is the study of nothing it is founded on nothing it rests on no principles it proceeds by no authority it has no data it can demonstrate nothing and it admits of no conclusion
3848156 i have generally been denominated a deist the reality of which i never disputed being conscious i am no christian except mere infant baptism makes me one and as to being a deist i know not strictly speaking whether i am one or not
3848157 the bible is not my book nor christianity my profession

3848189 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
3848190 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
3848191 attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed
3848192 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities the result motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are straitjacketed by gender stereotypes
3848193 many mothers tell us that in the first year of a babys life they want to stay at home but often feel they have to return to work too early because of financial constraints we need to do more to help mothers and fathers by increasing well paid parental leave and changing how it can be shared between them
3848194 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 in 1994 to 38 in 2002
3848195 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
3848196 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
3848197 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
3848198 in britain and the us however where support for equal opportunities for both sexes is much longer standing some people are now starting to have second thoughts
3848199 in most cases this appears to revolve around concerns that the welfare of children and of the family are being compromised the more women spend their time at work and find themselves lumbered with the double burden of employment and family care
3848200 we are still educating to confirm a gender role division that people thought was eradicated 25 years ago
3848201 at the moment in the uk we are heading in the wrong direction after a period when there was greater support at an ideological level for an equal division of labour
3848202 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
3848203 by making all roles flexible at every level ending the long working hours culture and challenging discriminatory attitudes women and men could participate in the workplace on an equal footing and live free from stereotypes about whose role it is to do the caring
3848204 when this happens business the economy and society as a whole will all reap the benefits
3848205 the british economy cannot afford not to have women in the workforce women make up 45 of employees in an age when we have significant skill shortages we cannot miss out on any part of the talent pool
3848206 our latest research shows 79 of organisations are struggling to recruit and 75 are struggling to retain skills they have to think how to address the need for more flexibility for women and men
3848207 a family does not suffer if a woman is in full time employment
3848208 it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children
3848209 quite frankly 4g represents a great opportunity for us because we see that as a capacity expansion higher data rates imply capacity expansion not just combining speed and download capability
3848210 so i think overall we see it as kind of wait and see and if market trends shift and change then thats something that will be easily accessible to us
3848211 you shouldnt be offended so its your fault you need to change grow up etc i am completely innocent and will continuing saying whatever i want to say
3848212 there was a four foot point blank 20 gauge shotgun wound on his shoulder
3848213 well he claims that he was attacked on his front porch

3848215 and if he shot the first dog and the second dog was running away then why would he shoot him
3848216 you could have said boo to these dogs and they would have run away
3848217 my kids played with those dogs everyones kids played with those dogs

3848239 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
3848240 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
3848241 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
3848242 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
3848243 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us

3848246 because of a new and unusual threat a polar bear stuck on land due to climate change

3848280 then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3848281 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage
3848282 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
3848283 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is because my granddaughter is such a beautiful happy child
3848284 when mercy is no longer a baby we want her back i do not want the money they said theyd give me
3848285 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
3848286 but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then

3848303 according to snl kagan 2007 was a banner year for cable networks
3848304 industry revenue increased by 12 6 in 2007 to 38 billion ad revenue jumped 10 5 to 19 billion while license fees affiliate revenues soared almost 15 to more than 20 billion
3848305 despite the recent economic downturn snl kagan expects 2008 to be another strong year thanks mainly to license fees which result from long term contracts and provide cable networks with nearly half of their revenue
3848306 id love to if we can find the right movie actually i have a part that just came up were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
3848307 apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score most of the ambient music throughout it
3848308 no one in the radiohead organization is aware of the band composing any original incidental or ambient music for choke
3848309 die jamaikanerin cecile mixt auf ihren deb t reggae genial mit hip hop und pop
3848310 this is playboy were talking about and with the readership that they have this is really great marketing and promotion for the cd
3848311 our music is multilingual and this is why people from all across europe many of them who dont speak english or jamaican patois can easily embrace the music and us the artistes
3848312 but the states leaders have failed to act therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3848313 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3848314 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3848315 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3848316 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3848317 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3848318 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3848319 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3848320 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3848321 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3848322 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3848323 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3848324 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3848325 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3848326 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3848327 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3848328 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3848329 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3848330 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3848331 i have to be careful because sometimes hell do a fast movement or run
3848332 but the other members arent as scared as i am

3848348 es una voz de alerta es un llamado de atenci n a que necesitamos reforzar el ejercicio de resolver los conflictos conversando y no agredi ndonos y a partir de eso reforzar el papel de los consejos escolares como medio de mediaci n de conflicto y soluci n de conflictos en el tema del colegio

3848350 la mediaci n escolar es un proceso en la cual un tercero ayuda a los compa eros que est n inmersos en un conflicto a solucionar sus problemas tiene una importancia muy significativa porque ayuda a prevenir futuras conductas y va a ser el medio que los alumnos van a utilizar para solucionar sus problemas por esta v a que es m s pac fica es un camino hacia la paz y no al enfrentamiento

3848352 californias dire fiscal condition which has devolved into an open conflict between the governor and the controller over the extent of the states cash crisis combined with the legislatures failure to enact an on time budget that includes authorization for the receivers construction activities raises the very real immediate prospect that our construction program will fail for lack of a clear stable source of funding
3848353 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least effects californias taxpayers and this years budget process but the state leaders have failed to act

3848358 a foreclosure may appear to offer the best deal on a home but there are numerous hidden costs
3848359 a foreclosed house is sold as is at times there will be a lot of time and skill involved to undertake major renovations as well as financial costs which should be considered if you value your leisure time
3848360 more and more customers are asking us about the process of buying foreclosed homes often they come back three months later and theyre saying im ready to buy a new home
3848361 they are hearing things that may or may not be true about what price a foreclosed home is really being sold for
3848362 mostly they found it a very frustrating process because theyve looked at many homes often not in good condition some have waited many months to even hear back whether their offer would be accepted sometimes they were told they had the winning offer and then find out the bank has decided not to sell the property
3848363 what i would say to that is that anybody making a decision about the biggest purchase of their lives should be well informed
3848364 you should know about the pros and cons of buying a foreclosed home or even a new home
3848365 a short sale is in the pre foreclosure process meaning the bank has given the owner a limited amount of time to sell before repossessing it this often results in complicated negotiations with both the owner and one or more banks it can take up to six months just to get a response to an offer homeshoppers taking this route should get ready for three way haggling lots of waiting and possibly no home
3848366 we would print things off mls so they can understand the difference in location difference in value difference in condition of the property so that you can make an apples to apples comparison
3848367 its good advice for people to go and look at alternatives and choices but to carefully evaluate it and look at the pros and the cons before they make a final decision
3848368 i think that often times that people who are satisfied with their experience in buying a foreclosed home are looking at it as an investment property
3848369 looking to rent it not as a personal primary residence

3848452 a lot of it has to do with the bands
3848453 when you put together bands like us and red hot chili peppers somebody has to headline and somebody is gonna be the supporting act and a lot of times bands dont see eye to eye on those things
3848454 i doubt linkin park would have a hard time opening for red hot chili peppers but there are times when for whatever reason a band just doesnt want to tour with another band like us
3848455 they didnt take anything important just souvenir medallions and brass crowns from statues
3848456 whats more serious is the hole in the stained glass window
3848457 from my perspective as a conservative evangelical barack obamas campaign and the democratic party have taken a historic and courageous step toward empowering women for an expanded range of choices and saving babies lives
3848458 pro lifers of both parties can now support sen obama on the basis that more lives will be saved than if they had just taken a moral stand hoping to overturn roe versus wade
3848459 there are no pro life voters whose main objection to the democratic party is that they are not rigorous enough in offering alternative choices
3848460 they have been reluctant to do that in the past
3848461 i am hopeful and prayerful that they will do this in the future
3848462 health care education income support adoption to catholics these are also pro life issues and moral issues so as a catholic and a feminist id say its not only about womens choice its not only about entitlement programs but its about the goal of enabling all women with their children to be full participants in our society
3848463 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3848464 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3848465 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3848466 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3848467 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3848468 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3848469 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3848470 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3848471 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3848472 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3848473 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3848474 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3848477 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3848478 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3848479 its almost impossible to predict where the lightnings going to strike on the web
3848480 people want to harness the web everybody from my publisher to movie studios to groups like radiohead but nobody really knows how to do it its like trying to herd cats
3848481 the point of the exercise is to stimulate book sales its a combination of desperation and creativity
3848482 im not the first person to observe that books are in a little bit of a crisis and we want to be able to provide our content in whatever platform people are going to turn to
3848483 if youre a publisher and you dont have a little p
3848484 people who surf the net are hop toady about it theyll find something and alight on it for a while and then their interest wanes and theyll go somewhere else its so quirky as to whats going to work and whats not
3848485 but take someone like stephenie meyer the kids love her and they spend huge amounts of time on the web if she were to pull out a vignette from those novels and put it online like were doing that baby would go viral theres no question about it
3848486 a lot of steves work translates visually thats why so much of it has been adapted for film and tv theres a tremendous amount of detail that goes into the plotting and the characters
3848487 how much ground would the germans give before they said fuck this and sought a separate peace
3848488 and the eight of us sat down at a table and the attorney said do you mind if i record the evening and we all said no of course not we sat there it was a long dinner i thought we were lightly chewing the rag but the next day the attorney comes up with eight single spaced pages flagging thirty six different inventions from dinner dinner
3848489 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps

3848491 how do you know which interest to pursue when you are interested in and possibly capable of so many varying things
3848492 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3848493 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3848494 it just didnt feel right he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3848495 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3848496 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3848497 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3848498 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3848499 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3848500 everyone knows the next one could be ukraine and then poland all of europe should be here now
3848501 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3848502 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no

3848504 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3848505 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3848510 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3848511 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one

3848528 we were able to characterize the motion of the receptor proteins in the membrane in real time as they respond to the antigen
3848529 perhaps more importantly we learned the cell membrane is really complicated and highly structured rather than fluid and unstructured as is the prevailing notion
3848530 when proteins bind antigens they begin to cluster this causes other proteins to thrash around that sends a message from the membrane to the cell nucleus that somethings wrong
3848531 but if there are places on the membrane that are walled off and an antigen lands there the cell may not be notified theres a problem no protein no warning

3848558 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult

3848630 the iphone 3g issues were device specific and nothing to do with the carriers networks
3848631 we suspect therefore that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3848632 on some internet sites t mobile is cited as saying that we assign some problems with 3g reception to the apparatus itself this is not what we want to transmit fact remains however that there are iphone3g customers in both the netherlands and in other countries which find that the use experience on this apparatus is not sufficient we do not know the reason for this and for this reason do we there now intensive research nasty

3848635 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
3848636 i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart
3848637 this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie
3848638 well we never found his body so were saying hes dead but well never really know
3848639 its not about money its about an attitude in the industry
3848640 just because the company that operates it is registered in the u k does not mean we will not go after then and hold them accountable
3848641 even though operating from the u s there was no 2257 labeling on the videofiles or on any pages of the website a clear violation of anyones interpretation of 2257 laws
3848642 as such we have also filed an unfair business practices claim against the site for not following 2257 labeling laws they are operating at an unfair business advantage over us and every other adult site that follows 2257 labeling laws

3848644 people really need to start working together more and more torrent sites know not to allow titan content and have warnings to their users not to upload titan content
3848645 while this is great for us all it does is pass the piracy burden on down the line to other similar producers
3848646 once these sites ban our content the other producers are shit outta luck and will need to take care of the piracy themselves all we are really doing is impacting the piracy of our content not anyone elses
3848647 quite frankly 4g represents a great opportunity for us because we see that as a capacity expansion higher data rates imply capacity expansion not just combining speed and download capability

3848675 with an election fast approaching republican dave reichert increasingly sounds like a democrat on energy
3848676 but his ideas are classic bush republicanism and his votes on key issues tell a different story
3848677 on the economy the story is the same in his ad reichert portrays himself as a champion of middle class families when his record tells a dramatically different story
3848678 that is an absurd accusation and ridiculous dave is not interested in taking money from a representative of eads

3848681 we need to be more careful in describing the hurricane story than he is
3848682 he has the bottom line right most storms at least those driven by the latent heat of vaporization will tend to be stronger or have the potential to be stronger in a warmer climate
3848683 what fascinates me about broads stories is that they seemed to at least implicitly contradict the view of global warming purveyed by his times colleague andrew revkin
3848684 yet this past atlantic season produced fewer hurricanes than forecasters predicted five versus nine and none that hit the united states
3848685 i find it amazing that there has been a well documented campaign to discredit the science of climate change and not a single article in the new york times pointing this out
3848686 weird mooneys the type of fiery liberal who will pen a diatribe against the right but isnt it odd he doesnt have a word to say about the new york times no we cant mind read this fiery young fellows motives but in trashing the right and whitewashing the times mooney does set up a lucrative mainstream writing career in the future when you see his by line appear in the times he has already published for the los angeles variant remember the knives he put in gores back to keep his own career hopes alive remember the knives he put in the back of you and your ongoing interests

3848694 the image of russia bombing a small neighboring state has got to draw peoples attention in a way that some of the other things russia has done in the last several years may not have drawn their attention
3848695 i think the russians took the wrong lessons from bucharest there was a lot of russian pressure and rhetoric against both georgia and ukraine getting membership action plans before bucharest
3848696 ive heard that russians regard bucharest as a success and what you saw after bucharest was an increase in pressure
3848697 so nato has got to think how you respond to this because you dont want the russians to conclude that this is a successful tactic that they can use again
3848698 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3848699 ive been asked for a couple years now if we are back in the cold war and ive always said no
3848700 but certainly this kind of action reminds one of czechoslovakia in 1968 and hungary in 1956 and i think it does require that western capitals and also russias neighbors take a look and ask what is russia about both in terms of its objectives but also in terms of the instruments and the means it is prepared to use to pursue those objectives

3848711 al fin y al cabo comprendemos que la direcci n georgiana sea un proyecto especial de estados unidos y comprendemos que estados unidos se preocupe por la suerte de ese proyecto

3848713 todos estos a os georgia ha sido armada principalmente por estados unidos
3848714 ha prevenido en numerosas ocasiones a sus socios estadounidenses de que era un juego peligroso que pod a desembocar en una aventura iniciada por georgia

3848716 ive talked to many other edwards supporters who gave all thatl they could to help him win the iowa caucuses and its just very very disapointing i feel very bad for elizabeth and the children and i know this is a very difficult time in their lives but i also feel i think david bonoir said it best a sense of betrayal about all of us who put so much of ourselves into that campaign and knowing that now this was lurking in the background just a great sense of frustration and disappointment
3848717 i never heard about the national enquirer story until probably about three months ago its not a publication that i read with any regularity
3848718 im more interested in focusing on the future than looking back to the caucuses
3848719 speculating on how that could have impacted the iowa caucuses is not a productive thing for the party at this time
3848720 i rode on the campaign bus with the edwards family and i saw the affection that was shared between then i saw when the kids would come out with sheet music that had christmas carols on it and the family would be singing while the bus was traveling down highway 20 that was the experience that i had with them during the heart of the iowa caucuses
3848721 estamos dispuestos al di logo y abrir la autopista auton mica pero siempre que se respete la autonom a ind gena a la par del resto de las autonom as
3848722 eso es inviable aqu nosotros siempre quisimos el di logo pero no tenemos confianza en el gobierno porque nunca ha cumplido
3848723 no hemos decidido nada al respecto a n y no est en los planes del ejecutivo adoptar una medida en ese sentido
3848724 en abrir el di logo es sincero y quienes siempre se negaron o rompieron la negociaci n fueron los prefectos

3848727 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding
3848728 in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths
3848729 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god

3848731 during the sentencing phase of hamdans trial the government had tried to invoke the geneva conventions which it had long argued were inapplicable to guant namo detainees to justify hamdans confinement in camp 5 one of the prisons highest security camps where detainees are held in conditions akin to super max conditions in the u
3848732 i see him all the time at least once a week
3848733 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3848734 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3848735 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
3848736 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3848737 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3848738 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3848739 george washington long ago warned america against entangling alliances and he was right
3848740 russia and georgia risk falling into a full scale war in which the u s can and hopefully will avoid any involvement but had georgia been a member of nato we would now be risking a full scale confrontation with nuclear armed russia
3848741 obviously america should encourage both countries to back down and resolve their differences peacefully
3848742 the status of south ossetia as well as abkhazia another russian supported separatist zone within georgia matters a lot more to russia on which the two territories border than to the u s moreover washington itself set a precedent for russia when it intervened in kosovo a decade ago attacking serbia to win independence for the separatist ethnic albanian majority
3848743 we should not create or expand alliances where the u s does not have vital interests if the europeans want to defend distant countries like georgia they can do so after all the european union has a larger population and bigger gdp than america without any of washingtons other global military commitments it is time for europe to accept responsibility for its own security
3848744 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3848745 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3848746 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3848747 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3848748 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3848749 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms
3848750 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3848751 when youre looking at yourself you see all your flaws and you think of them as being unattractive but when you look at someone else its the flaws that make them so beautiful
3848752 damn lucky smiles i certainly know that i have a chance thats one in a million and a job thats sort of disposable and i feel lucky that i havent been found out
3848753 i constantly recognise my incredible luck and am reminded of it every day when i talk to friends who said that they waited three hours for a casting call and they got to the door and it was shut in their face i was in the right place at the right time
3848754 no my head is screwed on pretty good and i just take it as it comes i suppose
3848755 i think it depends on where you come from and what kind of family you come from
3848756 i dont know thank you for saying im down to earth because you really dont know me i could be just a total prissy loser laughs but you know i guess i dont adjust thats probably why i stay the same laughs
3848757 oh definitely i mean thats a given women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry
3848758 it was fantastic to not only live with that music i love every day but to work with such wonderful musicians
3848759 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3848760 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
3848761 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then
3848762 lance had all of the qualities kate wanted in a mate
3848763 she throws herself into these relationships quickly then shes just over it
3848764 they just decided to end things theres no hatred just sadness
3848765 shes super need y and must be the center of someones attention
3848766 they were having problems and he ended it i think shes also still hung up on owen
3848767 but bretts had a girlfriend for three years brett and kate are just friends
3848768 lance felt that kate came on too strong too fast
3848769 wont work lance already made it clear they are 100 percent done
3848770 they gave each other a kiss that lasted much longer than a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer
3848771 in a biological context when two rather similar species i e energy transduction mechanisms compete for the same source of energy e g food the one with even slightly more effective mechanisms e g claws teeth feet etc captures more than the other
3848772 gradually the population of the more effective species will increase at the expense of the other
3848773 let us assume that a mutation happens to improve the speed of a cheetah
3848774 consequently this cheetah will catch more food i e more energy will channel through this individual the path has become steeper likewise a deleterious mutation will reduce the flow via the particular path that has turned less steep in this case the non mutated paths are the healthy rivalries and will enjoy correspondingly larger flows due to the diminished competition
3848775 a system evolves to reach a stationary state with respect to its surroundings
3848776 that is to say when the surrounding environment is high in energy then the system will evolve to a high energy stationary state matter on earth has evolved over eons in increasing its energy content to match that of the solar radiation density during this process mechanisms of energy transduction have improved but presumably there are still ways to catch more of the sunlight to power activities that are presently fueled by non renewables
3848777 the trouble is that god in this sophisticated physicists sense bears no resemblance to the god of the bible or any other religion
3848778 a universe with a god would look quite different from a universe without one a physics a biology where there is a god is bound to look different
3848779 i do not fear death in view of the fact that i had been dead for billions and billions of years before i was born and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it
3848780 we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in some of us just go one god further
3848781 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now
3848782 its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict
3848783 receives no compensation of any type from orion strategies and has not since may 15 2008
3848784 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
3848785 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3848786 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3848787 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3848788 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3848789 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3848790 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
3848791 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
3848792 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
3848793 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
3848794 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
3848795 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
3848796 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
3848797 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
3848798 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
3848799 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
3848800 but otero said in march that the university has approved many courses containing religious material and viewpoints including some that use such texts as
3848801 another rejected text biology for christian schools declares on the first page that
3848802 ok christian school x graduates you had at least four years of balderdash maybe more in chemistry biology astronomy geology archeology history etc etc so for you we have a three year series of courses
3848803 chemistry and christian faith most colleges see no connection between the two but at dordt college youll see how both give structure and order to the universe providing a sense of certainty for those who trust in the principles students are encouraged to see the wonder and beauty of this world as gods creativity not just the interesting results of accidents you will learn to view science as god ordained human activity and to understand its place in christian life you will be challenged to use what you learn for the glory of god and the good of creation not for selfish or destructive ends and you will gain a background that will help you confront and withstand the challenges of secular and unbiblical thinking
3848804 thinking from a biblical perspective about science is much different in some areas than if you believe we evolved from a rock
3848805 nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense
3848806 religious people split into three main groups when faced with science
3848807 there may be fairies at the bottom of the garden there is no evidence for it but you cant prove that there arent any so shouldnt we be agnostic with respect to fairies
3848808 we admit that we are like apes but we seldom realise that we
3848809 ich hatte beim generalstab nachgepr ft in poti gibt es keine russischen kr fte die sich auf das territorium georgiens zur unterst tzung der operation zur befriedung georgiens verlegt worden waren
3848810 es gibt russische truppen bei gori und senaki wir machen keinen hehl daraus
3848811 diese arsenale sollen unsch dlich gemacht werden damit sie keine zivilisten gef hrden
3848812 weder der b rgermeister noch sicherheitsbeamte sind da nur zivilisten denen es an lebensmitteln mangelt
3848813 ich bin erstaunt ber die derart parteiische berichterstattung der meisten polnischen medien ber die entwicklung in ossetien
3848814 ein durchschnittszuschauer oder leser kann den eindruck bekommen dass russland der aggressor ist der danach strebt einen teil des territoriums von georgien zu besetzen aber die russen verf gen ber ein mandat der friedenskr fte aufgrund eines russisch georgischen vertrages von 1992 zudem erstaunt die gewaltige st rke die georgien gegen ossetien zusammenzog mobilisiert wurden 100 000 reservisten die gegen eine republik mit einer einwohnerzahl von nur 70 000 k mpfen sollten
3848815 geschossen wurde nicht nur auf milit rische ziele sondern auf alles was sich in ossetien befand die situation ist kaum vorstellbar da der georgische pr sident panzer und artillerie nicht gegen soldaten sondern gegen friedliche einwohner ossetiens eingesetzt hat in den ersten stunden des angriffs wurden die universit t krankenh user und schulen unter beschuss genommen
3848816 erstaunlich ist welche m he sich ein teil unserer politischen elite bei versuchen gibt ihren patriotismus durch russophobie unter beweis zu stellen wenn es aber um eine humanit re katastrophe um den tod von tausenden zivilisten um die flucht der h lfte der ossetischen bev lkerung nach russland geht m ssten wir uns ber alle gegenseitigen beleidigungen hinwegsetzen
3848817 ich habe extra im generalstab nachgefragt es gibt keine russischen truppen in poti
3848818 bemerkenswert ist aber auch was bush nicht erw hnt hat
3848819 nichts wurde dar ber gesagt was in der nacht zum 8 august geschah als zchinwali von georgiern bombardiert wurde und die westlichen staatschefs schwiegen
3848820 alle schreiben dar ber dass das heutige georgien ein spezialprojekt der usa ist wir verstehen dass sich die usa um das schicksal dieses projekts k mmern
3848821 es gibt russische truppen bei gori und senaki wir machen keinen hehl daraus
3848822 diese arsenale sollen unsch dlich gemacht werden damit sie keine zivilisten gef hrden

3848830 nepal has a huge hydro power potential of 83 000 mw out of which 42 000 mw is considered to be economically feasible in the present condition the present hydro power capacity is about 500 mw only 18 of the population has access to electricity
3848831 the worlds top maker of solar power panels is set to become the top exporter of wind turbines and has two thirds of the global market in solar water heaters china is also a leading producer of energy efficient domestic appliances and rechargeable batteries

3848834 by alan glynn was one of my favorite books i read on the job while at miramax films
3848835 they had cut the previous writer off at treatment and had no interest in continuing with the project
3848836 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizeable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players and most of the atheists were very tolerant as well i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3848837 open to the idea that there is some creator somewhere
3848838 we have a number of team members that are pretty religious and so in design on the team in our small little microcosm of players out there we tried our best to make sure we werent overtly offending any religious people but yet we wanted to include the idea the concept of religion in the game
3848839 the battle to define the future of the book in the digital world
3848840 this is how scholarly material is going to come to the people
3848841 will become inaccurately synonymous with find it in a research paper

3848854 if mary would just not get so emotional and listen to my arguments about our finances and the kids we would get somewhere
3848855 well if brian would talk more and not just walk away we wouldnt fight i think we are just growing apart here
3848856 are you there for me do i and my feelings matter to you will you respond to me when i need you
3848857 people who expect all this woo woo stuff love and closeness in marriage are out of their minds
3848858 if youre lucky in love you get a reasonable roommate and even that is just the luck of the draw no one will ever figure love out
3848859 not true we really do know about the woo woo stuff we have cracked the code of love and you dont need luck we know how to do it
3848860 ik ben zeker ontgoocheld ja we lagen de hele eerste set boven hebben kansen gehad en hadden zelfs een setpunt als je constant leidt en je verliest de set dan toch dan krijg je een morele klap en wordt de rest van de wedstrijd nog harder het doet gewoon pijn om op zon manier te verliezen tegen zon goed duo maar we hebben twee goede wedstrijden gespeeld hier dus dat is positief voor de toekomst we hebben dit jaar amper kunnen samenspelen in mijn wedstrijd tegen gonzalez had ik niet de indruk slecht gespeeld te hebben hij speelde gewoon super
3848861 er zijn wel een pak positieve dingen te onthouden van het toernooi hier in peking het was in het algemeen een leuke ervaring ik had ook een goed spelgevoel hier ik heb goede wedstrijden gespeeld en het was tof om nog eens met steve te kunnen spelen ik heb bijvoorbeeld ook voor de eerste keer kunnen winnen van minar we hadden in het dubbel misschien nog beter kunnen doen maar we hebben echt alles gegeven
3848862 over de nederlaag in het enkelspel van olivier tegen gonzalez was ik niet ontgoocheld want dat was geen wedstrijd gonzalez was te sterk maar over dit dubbelspel wel ze hebben verschillende kansen gekregen om de eerste set binnen te halen maar ze hebben ze niet afgemaakt als ze die eerste set winnen is het een heel andere wedstrijd echt jammer want ze konden de russen aan
3848863 het is frustrerend dat we de kansen gemist hebben want we hebben een goede wedstrijd gespeeld ik ben nu ontgoocheld maar ik zal straks wel beseffen dat ik een superervaring meegemaakt heb het is een mooie week geweest

3848869 he just knocked on the door and wanted a drink of water
3848870 i feel raped i felt afterwards that night i had trouble going to sleep
3848871 just dont let anybody in unless you know who they are or if you have called them for some type of service
3848872 they didnt knock her in the head and go all over the house and take things i think she was lucky to get out with what she did 160 dollars
3848873 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias taxpayers and this years budget process but the states leaders have failed to act
3848874 therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the federal courts intervention to secure this funding
3848875 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3848876 when hardworking taxpayers cant even get health care in california
3848877 no receiver has ever defined what constitutes a constitutional level of health care
3848878 theyre throwing a lot of money at a standard thats never been established
3848879 goes to the very heart of the receivers remedial program

3848920 settings that provide reproductive health services for women need to continue to train their staff and ensure that they have adequate community links to assist women to respond to current and past experiences of partner violence
3848921 using an epidural for pain control after a major operation was safe and actually caused a slightly improved survival for patients who received an epidural
3848922 but a lot of people are nervous about having an epidural because it involves a needle and a catheter being placed in their back
3848923 this study provides reassuring information that epidural anesthetic is safe and may slightly increase the chance of surviving a major operation
3848924 these results may help patients make better informed choices about how they manage their pain after a major operation
3848925 pain is not good for you because it hinders your recovery
3848926 for them there is no question that the best pain relief is epidural
3848927 despite whats going on in the economy people are looking for ways to keep a youthful appearance not just for personal reasons but for their careers
3848928 who wants to go to work or to an interview and look tired
3848929 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet age related macular degeneration from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the united states and australia
3848930 if this really happens in the real world women on the pill would end up choosing a more genetically similar mate than she would otherwise choose and the implications go on from there
3848931 my own research says the way a man smells to a woman is the main determinant of sexual attraction
3848932 if you cant stand how someone smells you cannot become intimate
3848933 a womans response to a mans natural body odor will be colored by her feelings for him
3848934 so if you fell in love with a man online it would be hard to be repelled by his smell
3848935 it is important to ask about suicidal thoughts regularly especially when disease is worsening symptoms are increasing or the patient is entering a more serious phase of illness creating an environment where these issues can be openly explored without being judged is critical
3848936 more than half of ischemic strokes 52 in men and 54 in women may have been prevented through adherence to a healthy lifestyle
3848937 for total stroke 47 of cases in the women and 35 of cases in the men may have been prevented
3848938 this study shows that following a healthy lifestyle which has been associated with up to 80 lower risk of coronary diabetes may also prevent more than half of ischemic strokes
3848939 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan apparently the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced calorie diet
3848940 when you supplement particularly one specific type of nutrient you can upset the metabolic balance how the body processes those nutrients
3848941 maybe you have too much of one thing not enough of something else and that may put your cells at risk
3848942 we kind of expected it would be at least half
3848943 they have often reached out to supplements as a backup to a healthy diet
3848944 talk to your doctor or meet with a registered dietitian someone who can help you evaluate whether you need a supplement or not
3848945 there is no need to treat cancer survivors at this point in their journey any differently
3848946 what isnt known is supplement uses effect on cancer relapse that is up in the air
3848947 if you really think you need a supplement you probably cant go wrong taking a multivitamin calcium and d and fish oil but if you are eating two to three fish servings a week you probably dont need the fish oil
3848948 most of the data on nutrient intake in cancer risk is on primary prevention
3848949 the council does not have a specific recommendation on supplements for cancer survivors
3848950 there is no reason to think these would be harmful
3848951 the study supports the use of 11c pib pet in the evaluation of beta amyloid deposition in for example mild cognitive impairment alzheimers disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus
3848952 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether 11c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of 11c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation
3848953 in settings with a large proportion of psa detected tumors the relative reduction in risk of death following radical prostatectomy removal of the gland might be somewhat larger or similar to that in our study but the absolute reduction would be smaller
3848954 unclear how these results apply to the patients we are taking care of today they show how many questions remain unanswered
3848955 basically i dont think we know the right answer about what to do
3848956 more men die with their prostate cancer than of it
3848957 i have discussions with a patient about his other medical conditions his age his willingness to receive treatment that may have long term side effects weighed against the risk that he may develop an aggressive cancer
3848958 does provide evidence that intervention in the form of surgery does have a curative effect for some men the question is which men
3848959 with screening you catch a lot of different types of cancer and also at different ages there is no information in the study on the age of detection
3848960 the big benefit of treating potentially lethal prostate cancer comes early in the first five to 10 years
3848961 showed lots of benefits of surgery but did not find any benefit from surgery for men over the age of 65
3848962 our study found that combat deployment in support of the wars in iraq and afghanistan was significantly associated with new onset heavy weekly drinking binge drinking and other alcohol related problems among reserve guard and younger personnel after return from deployment
3848963 because alcohol use may serve as a coping mechanism after traumatic events it is plausible that deployment is associated with increased rates of alcohol consumption or problem drinking
3848964 i think this study is probably very accurate as part of the re entry process people will turn to coping mechanisms that are easily accessible and alcohol is easily available socially acceptable and quite effective for short term stress relief
3848965 surround yourself with people you can talk to and establish a support system that isnt tied to a bar
3848966 have a huge effect and it could lead people to treatment on their own
3848967 would be a real and clear indication that they valued and respected the contribution of these people
3848968 awareness of risk factors for joint symptoms will help both clinicians and patients to anticipate and manage these symptoms and ensure optimum adherence to endocrine treatment
3848969 one of the highest priority tasks to avoid contamination of the human food chain with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
3848970 enables the real time detection of possible central nervous system cns tissue contamination on carcasses during slaughter
3848971 small quantities of bovine spinal cord were reliably detected in the presence of raw bovine skeletal muscle fat and vertebrae the research lays the foundation for development of a prototype device allowing real time monitoring of cns tissue contamination on bovine carcasses and meat cuts
3848972 the risk of relapse was still small but certainly not insignificant
3848973 i think these numbers are somewhat reassuring but they also highlight the need for new therapeutic options for women who have completed five years of treatment
3848974 these tumors are certainly more aggressive early on but the outlook is good for women with these tumors who survive for five years
3848975 we can now tell these women that their risk for developing a recurrence is lower than for women with er positive tumors
3848976 there has been some discussion about whether aggressive treatment makes a difference and this study supports the view that it does
3848977 the jury is still out on what we need to be offering women who have finished five years of adjuvant treatment
3848978 what this study tells us is that these women still have a residual risk of recurrence that is significant
3848979 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3848980 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3848981 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect
3848982 we really dont know if its better than current therapy
3848983 the main purpose of chemotherapy for metastatic advanced non small cell lung cancer is to improve quality of life since the patient populations are never cured
3848984 it works now from top to bottom it probably hasnt worked or looked like this since the 1970s
3848985 the airport will make a great home for the clock over the next couple of years
3848986 there is no question that the clock of the nations is a true community treasure and a significant part of rochesters history
3848987 gt petr gutweil 12 of czech republic has received postcards from all over the world thanks to his connections with canandaigua

3849019 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3849020 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3849021 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3849022 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3849023 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3849024 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3849025 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem

3849042 lejos aplicar medidas que mejoren las condiciones de acceso aprovecha el decreto 82 2008 de 6 de junio por el que se regulan las actuaciones protegidas para facilitar el acceso a la vivienda en la comunitat para recortar las ayudas de acceso a una primera vivienda con cargo a los presupuestos de la generalitat
3849043 repercute en los j venes y personas con menos ingresos que son las que m s ayudas necesitan para acceder a una vivienda
3849044 es el resultado de la falta de liquidez del gobierno del camps
3849045 una vez m s en lugar de recortar por donde el despilfarro se recorta por las ayudas a los mas d biles
3849046 bajo ning n concepto es admisible que dicho aumento de los precios vaya acompa ado de una reducci n tan considerable de las ayudas
3849047 seguir eludiendo su responsabilidad y competencias en materia de vivienda protegida

3849063 in our recent second quarter earnings release we informed investors that we expected the markets to remain difficult and we would be taking additional actions to further reduce our costs we have begun implementing those initiatives which we expect will result in a reduction of our staffing levels of approximately 10 percent we believe this reduction in force which results from our cost savings initiatives will ultimately strengthen our position both in the short term and as the markets normalize

3849067 i asked several people around the city what it means to be a new yorker some said pride some said its the electric environment and one said its independence that they dont need other people out of all the five boroughs brooklyn seems to uphold the characteristics of what it means to be a new yorker best
3849068 as americans we hope to have a memorial site soon as well as the freedom tower some sort of memorial should be done properly and soon

3849073 that is what this election should be focusing on everything else is just bogus rhetoric designed by cynical candidates who think americans are so stupid so bloody stupid that if you just show them wind turbines in your olympics ad theyll actually think you showed up and voted for such renewable power when you didnt

3849075 we are concerned about what appears to be a drive toward minimum standards by our airline and others
3849076 until now american airlines has never been an airline that has been satisfied with meeting only federally mandated minimums
3849077 we dont fly to federal minimums we fuel to what is safe and always meet and exceed those minimums

3849091 the conference is expected to give direction on how the co ordination of the work programmes of various institutions for women and youth within the environmental sector could be integrated and streamlined to maximise benefits and share resources
3849092 the conference will also bear testament to the progress that government and its stakeholders have made in ensuring that south african women take charge of the environment and are truly empowered to take environmental action

3849097 showhomes is one of the most attractive franchise opportunities in the country right now our owners generate income far higher than industry average and they really enjoy what they do we have worked hard as a team with our franchise owners for the past four years and it shows the survey results speak for themselves
3849098 evidence had been lost or destroyed nearly two thirds of the time that prosecutors agreed to search for it because ohio does not require evidence to be catalogued and saved
3849099 i can say definitively itll happen before tuesday night at the convention i can also say that its probably going to happen sometime the week before
3849100 with great reluctance and yet a sense of firm conviction
3849101 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs
3849102 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
3849103 during the evening when the noise was going on he came out and confronted the victim and they had a scuffle

3849106 we have a very high percentage of baby boomers who will hit 65 in the next three or four years and then keep hitting 65
3849107 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
3849108 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
3849109 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
3849110 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
3849111 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
3849112 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
3849113 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
3849114 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
3849115 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
3849116 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
3849117 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
3849118 cbs has a done a good job i think in terms of getting the blood system back on track they have a lot of infrastructure capability that we can leverage
3849119 i expect them to work very co operatively with their provincial partners and its going to be good for everybody
3849120 we have for some time been sharing organs across the country even internationally
3849121 we have understandings that if theres a high status liver recipient waiting in edmonton and we have a donor in ontario that the liver from our donor goes there on a priority basis
3849122 i think cbs will be in a better position to make those agreements standard but more important weve been operating till now with rather rudimentary information systems we get information by fax we get it by telephone
3849123 it refers to the situation where i need a kidney transplant i have a family member or a friend whos prepared to give me their kidney but they cant do it because their blood types dont match
3849124 so our thought here is can i trade with somebody else maybe you need a kidney too youve got a family member whos prepared to give a kidney to you but your blood types dont match but when we look at your donor and me and my donor and you the blood types do match so you can do a swap or an exchange
3849125 for every province its better to be doing this nationally because we all share in a bigger pool well all get more matches its an excellent program
3849126 therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding

3849132 i quickly told my husband and my father to stay in the house because i knew it was safer there but my husband he was so frightened he ran away and got shot
3849133 as they shot i quickly dropped myself to the ground a bullet hit my back but i lay still
3849134 hundreds of man died that day making there were only women and children in this village
3849135 it took us two days to bury all 431 dead bodies
3849136 its hard to identify all the victims we only managed to identify 181 out of 431 victims

3849323 i am changing my name because master p is who i used to be i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood i wouldnt change my past because it has groomed me to be the man i am today growing up has nothing to do with age people grow up mentally and spiritually through life experiences but when you come from hip hop it is almost impossible to get past the stereo type it associates you with i will always love hip hop it plays a major role in who i am today i have branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all of that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry its important for young hip hop artists to know that they are not limited to one career they can educate themselves and prepare for life after hip hop the same way pro athletes prepare themselves for life after sports also know that you can branch out into other avenues if you are multi talented or have other dreams my dream was to enter corporate america my sons dream is to go to college and play basketball and will smiths was to be a famous actor many of us can begin new careers take advantage of different opportunities and still remain true to hip hop there are a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the businessman my goal is to educate the hip hop culture now and if they dont get it then hopefully their kids will get it and understand my fellow hip hop artists should know that we cant rap forever im glad im in a position in my life where i dont have to put out music because ive prepared myself for the future to build the generational wealth we have to educate our families thats why my son is going to college fifteen years later im still successful because ive realized the importance of education growing up and responsibility
3849324 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
3849325 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
3849326 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
3849327 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
3849328 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
3849329 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
3849330 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
3849331 globally xdr tb has resulted from a combination of poor tb control practices poor adherence to medications inappropriate use of second line drugs lack of laboratory capacity to culture tb or assess drug susceptibility and high hiv prevalence
3849332 in order to prevent an escalation in xdr tb we need to ensure adherence to the cornerstones of tb management which include directly observed therapy isolation of infectious cases and contact investigations we also need to institute routine rapid and standardized methods to assess drug susceptibility of tb isolates
3849333 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
3849334 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
3849335 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
3849336 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
3849337 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
3849338 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
3849339 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes
3849340 our hypothesis was that if we could artificially induce conditions like those produced by the armstrong strain it would help the immune system clear an infection by clone 13
3849341 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases
3849342 these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
3849343 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
3849344 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease
3849345 the trauma that ive been through has has impacted us in many ways
3849346 while watching this driver all over the road i thought there has to be a better way to stop drinking and driving
3849347 this is how i got the idea of putting together a video that would educate the community that drinking and driving is not an option
3849348 its one thing to do an interview on a typical subject but to have a family tell me about their worst nightmare was a whole new experience
3849349 i contacted the national press photographers association nppa president tony overman and explained the issue at hand overman forwarded my questions to nppa legal counsel mickey h osterreicher who advised me that if i was to tackle a subject like this i should play it safe and video photograph only subjects from behind
3849350 each family helped out in a special way and only wanted one thing in return to get the message out that drinking and driving needs to stop
3849351 i put this video together but it took a community working together to produce the finished product i cant thank everybody enough who helped out it couldnt have been done without you
3849352 the apollo moon shot and the human genome project rallied support for massive r amp d efforts that created the capabilities to overcome obstacles that were not contemplated at the outset of these initiatives
3849353 similarly todays barriers to improving biofuels are significant but genetics and genomics can catalyze progress towards delivering in the not too distant future economically viable and more socially acceptable biofuels based on lignocellulose
3849354 over the past 10 000 years wild plant species were selected for their desirable traits resulting in todays highly productive food crops we simply dont have thousands of years in the face of the energy and climate challenges so by applying the power of genomics to these problems we are seeking to speed up the domestication of energy crops and the technologies for converting them to suitable biofuels as a more carbon neutral approach to meeting part of our transportation needs
3849355 with the data that we are generating from plant genomes we can home in on relevant agronomic traits such as rapid growth drought resistance and pest tolerance as well as those that define the basic building blocks of the plants cell wall cellulose hemicellulose and lignin biofuels researchers are able to take this information and design strategies to optimize the plants themselves as biofuels feedstocks altering for example branching habit stem thickness and cell wall chemistry resulting in plants that are less rigid and more easily broken down
3849356 using this prospecting technique we can survey the vast microbial biodiversity to gain a better picture of the metabolic potential of genes and how they can be enlisted for the enzymatic deconstruction of biomass and subsequent conversion to high energy value fuels
3849357 given the daunting magnitude of fossil fuel used for transportation we will likely have to draw from several different sources to make an appreciable impact with cellulosic biofuels all of which will in some significant way will be informed by genomics
3849358 toward this end rapid new sequencing methods and the large scale genomics previously applied to sequencing the human genome are being exploited by bioenergy researchers to design next generation biofuels higher chain alcohols and alkanes with higher energy content than petroleum and more adaptable to existing infrastructure
3849359 party officials decided it was fine it was perfectly legal
3849360 definitely a peoples person our world will never be the same without him
3849361 i am 30 the age at which christ began his mission no more childish things no more vain things no more love no more marriage now lord let me only think of thy will but why oh my god cannot i be satisfied with the life that satisfies so many people
3849362 pra has tracked the efforts of such right wing organizations as the ird for years our quarterly the public eye has published key research on the subject
3849363 so we are thrilled the arcus foundation has given us the resources to take our investigations even further and further support those within the episcopal methodist and other churches who are defending equity
3849364 i think we all knew the restructuring plan was going to take a lot of time to put together
3849365 whats shocking to me is how long the court of appeals is taking
3849366 ive heard people give me stories like the court should not be rushed into making decisions like this but we do have 2 000 retail investors who have their life savings in limbo
3849367 i think this is a unique enough situation that the decision should be expedited
3849368 im hoping and im hoping and getting really scared they might not pay back the money
3849369 i was looking after money for my niece because she lost both parents and im feeling very guilty
3849370 at this stage i really dont know what ill do going back to real estate is difficult this stage because of the housing market
3849371 episcopal relief amp development is committed to maintaining the highest standards of accountability so we are extremely pleased to be recognized by charity navigator for excelling at this
3849372 by effectively administering the financial support of our donors we can truly heal a hurting world
3849373 shall the diocese of quincy separate from the episcopal church
3849374 the church in crisis a resource for the diocese of quincy
3849375 what people on different sides of our most painful current debate hope others have heard or are beginning to hear in our time together i want to imagine what the main messages would be
3849376 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
3849377 the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
3849378 let him who is without sin cast the first stone
3849379 and why do you not judge for yourselves what is right
3849380 do not judge by appearances but judge with right judgment
3849381 god sent his son into the world that the world might be saved
3849382 as stating the position of the worldwide anglican communion on issues of sexual ethics
3849383 as archbishop i understand my responsibility to be to the declared teaching of the church i serve and thus to discourage any developments that might imply that the position and convictions of the worldwide communion have changed
3849384 canadian regulatory approval is the culminating step to launch aurigen reinsurance company and provide the canadian life insurance market with greater choice for its reinsurance partners
3849385 realmente se n o houver qualquer tipo de problema a gente deve jogar da forma que treinou hoje
3849386 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not as a result of works so that no one may boast
3849387 great job dillon you are really good wow that was cool dillon way to go dillon
3849388 see more pics of famous couples before they broke up
3849389 you were as much in my hands as water or darkness or nothing could ever be held
3849390 so real and unpretentious and so much fun to boot
3849391 i told him to go ahead the light was green
3849392 i am glad you are not taking care of my kid
3849393 what if a driver were on a cell phone or ran the light
3849394 our country faces very grave economic military and foreign policy challenges and many americans of all political parties will vote for a change in november barack obama is the only candidate who offers that change of direction we need
3849395 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3849396 the show that made the phrases yada yada yada master of your domain shrinkage and no soup for you part of american culture is every bit as compelling today as it was during its original run
3849397 reinforce the shows iconic comedy and perpetual humor among college students and participants across the country
3849398 government should care for those who cant care for themselves
3849399 all right for blacks and whites to date each other
3849400 now in its fifth year the vh1 hip hop honors has come to represent the pinnacle of innovation and achievement in hip hop music
3849401 this years five honorees are no different and are being recognized for their significant contributions to hip hop culture and for helping to elevate hip hop into a truly global phenomenon
3849402 you call a person and not a place and that makes all the difference
3849403 tardiness previously had a moral dimension to it to be on time was to be virtuous
3849404 everyone rushes to their cell phones foreclosing the opportunities in the here and now
3849405 if youre talking with family and friends youre just hearing the same thing over and over its through these weak ties these random encounters that you hear the new joke hear about the new job meet your new girlfriend
3849406 one of my big concerns about cell phones is we have a generation of people coming up who are not well practiced at being alone they dont know how to be alone and that is really important
3849407 ive kind of given that up now and i just play along
3849408 its one of those dreams you have as a child in america
3849409 ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own
3849410 lance lives a life im not at all familiar with
3849411 no movie stars or million dollar bank accounts for me
3849412 i had started having some pain in my hips for a few months but im kind of a self confident person and thought i could diagnose myself
3849413 i would ice my joints and take anti inflammatories and just push through
3849414 my doctor said i needed to stop running and quit doing impact sports and i handled it real well
3849415 i went home and told my husband my life was over my husband is a funny guy too he suggested my life wasnt over i was just going to have to join the real world and get myself a job
3849416 i could win a gold medal and people on the street would still ask me about lance
3849417 but thats ok i dont think he has a gold medal
3849418 the number looks disturbingly bullish but well probably see some rebound in gasoline supplies next week now that refineries are back online after the storm
3849419 weve got a good sized really going here today but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3849420 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3849421 the price of gas will impact a persons travel habits but for the rv industry its really about the lack of financing thats causing the current downward trend in rv sales
3849422 weve had a tremendous sell off traders are looking for an excuse to buy back in and they found one
3849423 theyre usually doing some good but this time theyre wrong
3849424 the investigation will determine if the police did not act properly
3849425 but for me i think the police have to take part of the responsibility for what happened
3849426 i think the biggest problem is not the young people
3849427 its squarely the police because without their bungling we wouldnt have had this trouble
3849428 this is something that is frequently unheard of as a firefighter we expect our danger to come from the building to come from the fire were really not accustomed to having to worry about the population
3849429 it is the olympics and you just have to make one mistake and it is over i am glad we didnt make the mistake today
3849430 we got plenty of opportunities if the score stays 0 0 they get stronger i am happy we made the most of the corner in the end
3849431 everybody knows holland are one of the best teams in the world i think very few people would have thought we would have got really close
3849432 so i am proud at how the guys worked and we showed some quality
3849433 eventually holland scored a corner they got some cheap ones obviously when we got tired that was the difference
3849434 we said we beat them at the european cup and we can do it again
3849435 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3849436 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3849437 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3849438 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3849439 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3849440 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3849441 the oca an organization representing asian pacific americans also found the photo disturbing
3849442 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3849443 a seur official in madrid said the company had not intended to offend the chinese people but has no immediate plans to withdraw the ad which is scheduled to run on selected days until the end of the games
3849444 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3849445 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3849446 frank zhang li nings director of government and public affairs played down the incident
3849447 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3849448 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3849449 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3849450 to the west of the park up to the city boundary is continuous forest theres almost no fuel break
3849451 if we can reduce the fuels within the park we stand a much better chance of saving the park if there were a forest fire
3849452 we have a productive active dialogue going on with our bondholders
3849453 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3849454 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3849455 we have instructions from gen oviedo to collaborate as much as possible with lugo because this is the only way to lift this country out of poverty
3849456 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
3849457 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3849458 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3849459 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3849460 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3849461 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3849462 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3849463 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3849464 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
3849465 but i never saw anyone else like family or kids
3849466 were just glad we were able to get to them
3849467 i lost about 20 pounds but beyond that im feeling fine
3849468 i was just worried about him and just wanted him to know that we still love him
3849469 we got together in the locker room and gave him a big hug and just told him how we felt about him
3849470 hes too passionate just to give it up like that
3849471 he loves the game he loves the game so much hes going to ride this thing until the wheels fall off ill tell you that
3849472 hes a relentless personality a relentless coach and he just never allows himself to give in to anything
3849473 he attacked this the way he attacks the game and the way he attacks life and didnt let anyone feel sorry for him
3849474 on the court hes crazy but off the court hell do anything for you
3849475 all the guys who played at uconn have calhouns voice in there mind somewhere in the back of their head somewhere as they are moving throughout life whether doing something right or wrong
3849476 you know that there is something that he instilled in you that allowed you to be who you are today

3849479 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3849480 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3849481 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3849482 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3849483 we have a very high percentage of baby boomers who will hit 65 in the next three or four years and then keep hitting 65
3849484 analysts as a group continue to forecast above average profit growth
3849485 the recent weakening of many currencies versus the u s dollar appears to be related more to a potential weakening of world economies and related less to any perceived renewed growth in the u s economy
3849486 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3849487 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3849488 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3849489 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3849490 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3849491 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3849492 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3849493 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3849494 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3849495 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3849496 the right information has to be given to the people
3849497 no were getting more demand over here lets hold off on this project lets go out and take a look at this
3849498 will you take this because were giving you so much work will you take this at another point and a half lower because this is where the market tends to be in construction management
3849499 theyre going to shoot you and theyre going to kill you if you dont learn the power of silence

3849505 sei la cosa pi bella che mi sia capitata con te mi sento completo
3849506 what we know is that if you see a very frail person next to somebody not so frail the very frail person is more likely to have alzheimers pathology in their brain when they die
3849507 this is important as we try to wrap our heads around the biology of aging
3849508 because it turns out that as you get older alzheimers pathology signs of its development are really ubiquitous even if that doesnt mean that you actually have dementia so this finding could alter the way most medical and non medical people conceptualize alzheimers as a disease simply of impaired memory and cognition while expanding our view of what it actually means to become frail
3849509 so now we put all this together and it raises the possibility that alzheimers is much more of a public health issue than previously thought if it turns out that being weak is a sign of its onset
3849510 but if so we also now have a clue as to how we can possibly intervene perhaps by treating motor dysfunction years before people develop dementia so that they wont develop dementia as early
3849511 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3849512 these factors do not come into play for men who overall are 7 percent more likely to cheat than women
3849513 the likelihood of a man having had an affair increases with age and reaches a peak when a man is about 55 years old it then decreases with age for women the peak is 45 years old
3849514 the benefits of female infidelity reduce after the age of 40 because a woman would no longer benefit in terms of improved gene quality from the affair
3849515 men also experience a reduction of sperm quality around the age of 45 but the reproductive benefits of an affair extend further into a mans lifetime than a womans
3849516 to the barber just a little off the top please
3849517 what do you get when you cross a redneck and a peacock
3849518 were all trying to get the bass pro shops chevy back into contention weve got a lot of races this week and if we can start well then maybe we can build some momentum when we head to montana and canada
3849519 its always fun to go somewhere new thats when you can rely on having a good team weve got a veteran crew with scuba steve swenson and coolie mike cool and even tsr no 15 crew chief ricky warner offers some advice those guys will get the car close and then its up to me from there maybe going to a new track makes it an even playing field like i said if we have some good things happen early in the week then maybe we can build on it and get things going the way we want to
3849520 why do you think god gave you two ears and one mouth because youve got to do a lot more listening than you do talking
3849521 but ninth and 10th are definitely not because there can be a four round swing any given weekend in drag racing so you want to have an eight round cushion if you have two races to go
3849522 i said this before the western swing that we were going to need to get 10 or 11 round wins minimum to have a good shot at staying in the top 10
3849523 after going nine races without a round win to get round wins at every race of the last four is very rewarding
3849524 its interesting the goal is always to win races but really a more important goal for the next two races is to win rounds and preserve that top 10 spot wed just like to win four rounds each race
3849525 im not so much surprised ive done pretty much the same thing my whole life just go out there and run around and have fun and big plays happen so im not really shocked

3849531 there is no public evidence of her ever using the word
3849532 when was the precise moment she became proud of america
3849533 michelle obamas pride in america is long standing diffuse and organic
3849534 in the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time including the bush cheney energy bill which gave close to 3 billion dollars in new giveaways to big oil a terrible policy that john mccain opposed the truth is barack obamas plan is a job killing machine that ignores the struggling economy and raises taxes on family savings social security and small businesses
3849535 the truth is national journal a non partisan publication ranked barack obama as the most liberal senator in the u s senate john mccain simply said that he didnt know whether or not barack obama is a socialist and noted that national rankings have rated him as more liberal than the only self proclaimed socialist in the senate its up to barack obama to explain his extreme record
3849536 in the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time includin
3849537 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3849538 the evidence is going to show that she left when her brother didnt come back with food and that somebody did commit homicide on her and it had nothing to do with david onstott
3849539 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
3849540 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
3849541 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign

3849547 economy continues to be supply constrained most acutely in the areas of physical and social infrastructure which require focussed policy attention
3849548 the sizeable increase in off budget liabilities estimated above would carry an even larger interest payment burden in future
3849549 a large backlog of fuel price adjustments urgently for preserving order transmitting the right signals to dampen the market demand for automotive fuels which in turn has a large impact on our external payments
3849550 the opportunity cost of foregone power generation is expressed in the form of foregone incremental industrial output and an increase in their average cost of supply
3849551 aside from the plethora of challenges already on the table there is also some danger on the food price inflation front
3849552 realistic policy endeavour would be to bring down inflation from the current level of 11 12 per cent do a level closer to 7 per cent by march 31 2009

3849560 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
3849561 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to

3849569 im proud of whatever he has achieved and i want him to grab another olympic medal to add to his atlanta games bronze
3849570 like a good teacher would always want his student to achieve more than what he or she has achieved i too want him to do that im both his teacher and father im proud of his achievement but more than that im more proud because he is such an amazingly joyful boy
3849571 the only time i dont like it is when im introduced as leanders father
3849572 when he started we decided that he has to better leslie claudius four olympic appearances though he went on to do that i then realised someone has played in more
3849573 his bronze in atlanta was a huge surprise for all now he is in his fifth olympic and still hungry for a medal

3849582 i enjoyed working with writer turned director sanjay chhel and mallika
3849583 for me art film has a non formula story the distinction lies in whether you can predict the story or not
3849584 it is about life of married couples in large metropolises the film is entertaining and yet very real the two pairs in the film are irrfan khan and soha ali khan myself and konkana sen sharma

3849603 failed to represent the wishes of dr albert barnes and this community
3849604 the fact is that the public and the community of lower merion and montgomery county were not well served by the failure of mr corbett to fulfill his responsibilities
3849605 the failure of attorney general corbett to protect dr barnes and thereby the public interest undermines the likelihood that generous individuals will do good things with confidence that their wishes will be respected
3849606 i just want to know why now and not during the court case
3849607 i would vote for my neighbors dog against tom corbett whose abdication of responsibility in the matter of the barnes has been a historic disgrace
3849608 the hard working middle class family doesnt read them theyre looking for solutions on fuel prices health care bringing our valiant troops home from iraq and saving social security in this race only paul kanjorski has offered answers to those dire problems weve got barletta on the run and that will be more evident in the next few days

3849610 the original crooked jades were around for 10 years and we had rehearsal every week
3849611 you could really get into a groove and thats a really important thing but at the same time sometimes things can get a little stagnant and stale i almost think im liking this new situation where we only get together four or five days before a tour everything is so fresh and were so excited to play with each other and i think it really shows
3849612 theres connections i can feel and ultimately i just go with my gut
3849613 i just try not to make a big deal out of it
3849614 i feel like someone just hit the big reset button on everything
3849615 i dont think he ever really counted on quite the success that he got but i dont think it would have mattered
3849616 it was one of the best things in the world to do
3849617 there is a little bit of a built in household name with smash mouth
3849618 but usually when people think of smash mouth they think of steve
3849619 it was just one of those things where either me or one of the other people in the band had to leave and if that person left then that band wouldnt be together anymore
3849620 my friends are in that band so i didnt want everyone to lose their jobs just because two of us didnt really get along
3849621 it just sucks cause those guys wont talk to me anymore
3849622 greg was a member of the group since day one and hes a very talented songwriter and musician

3849624 smash mouth was supposed to be this fun in the sun thing
3849625 and after a while you just get kind of tired of trying to write about happy stuff
3849626 people always told me you sound like a little kid you should get a lead singer

3849630 nella grave e complessa situazione creatasi in ossezia del sud e nei rapporti tra georgia e russia leuropa ha saputo esprimersi con una sola voce e dare un essenziale contributo di moderazione e di equilibrio le conclusioni unanimi cui giunto il consiglio per le relazioni esterne riunitosi a bruxelles ne sono testimonianza e costituiscono anche per noi motivo di forte soddisfazione
3849631 ha aperto la strada a queste conclusioni ed a un rinnovato impegno dellunione europea in una cruciale zona di potenziale conflitto la missione a mosca e a tbilisi del presidente sarkozy in quanto presidente di turno del consiglio dellunione europea e desidero far giungere a lui personalmente il nostro vivo compiacimento

3849638 witnessing a recurrence of pakistani rhetoric and allegations that are factually wrong and that bear no relationship to reality
3849639 i am fully with koda and all ministers in the state are also with the chief minister how can we leave him as he is our leader
3849640 who respects the jmm chief more than his soren own son does
3849641 madhu koda government is doing fine and is fighting communal forces well upa government was formed in the state to fight the communal forces we appeal to congress chief sonia gandhi and senior congress leader ahmed patel and rjd chief lalu prasad to ensure that the upa government in the state is not destabilised
3849642 we are unapologetic about our role in the amarnath agitation it is the response of the masses due to the accumulation of their grievances if parties supporting upa can plead for organisation like simi why cant we stand with the masses
3849643 rescue efforts were hampered by narrow lanes leading to the site as well as rains

3849649 the government is alert and will never give in to their demands strict action will be taken against those who take the law into their own hands
3849650 this incident on the farmers no other situation can be grave than this a peaceful dharna was announced by farmers at a panchayat but the police opened fire

3849653 both emerging and development markets are down with china and india having dropped the most developed countries by relatively less and commodity exporting countries like south africa brazil russia and soudi arabia the least
3849654 having lost one fifth to one third of their value equity assets would appear to have greater upside rather than down side prospects if there are no major further shocks a slow albeit hesitant recovery may be envisaged
3849655 the civil society should come forward for resolution of the issue so that peace is restored in jammu and kashmir
3849656 even during the nine day agitation muslims set up langars for yatries and tourists we are not communalists it is the vhp and sangh parivar who are communal and bent upon weakening india

3849663 then ask someone who works closely with you and knows you well to write down the five things they see you doing that have the greatest effect on your performance be prepared to hear some things that come as a bit of a surprise
3849664 being a chief executive only says that an individual has the job not that they can do it well
3849665 leadership takes place everywhere once you understand that leadership is about performance improvement getting things done well done better done faster done on time done reliably then you realise that everyone in an organisation has a leadership role to play

3849677 finds deeply objectionable the series of remarks by the official spokesman and leaders in pakistan on recent events in the indian state of jammu and kashmir
3849678 it is not too late for pakistani leaders and spokesmen to desist from the course of action that they have recently embarked upon and we would urge them to do so forthwith
3849679 creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward

3849687 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge

3849691 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3849692 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3849766 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations

3849875 we are used to being lauded for our achievements but over the last few months there has been a string of high profile road rage events involving cyclists and motorists that have overshadowed our achievements as someone passionate in providing alternatives to people driving along in there car it is absolutely important that we stay on top this issue

3849879 it is time that we all just frickin share the road people
3849880 as people drive less the funding for transportation goes down because we are primarily funded by gas tax
3849881 extend that bicycle network in the way we would like to do it
3849882 education is critical in keeping us safe and keeping things moving
3849883 for heavens sakes if youre a pedestrian you need to look around and see whats going on if youre a motorist you need to look around and see if you have pedestrians and cyclists and the same thing is true if youre a cyclist so that eye contact is a very critical part of the equation
