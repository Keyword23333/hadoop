7330000 as long as clinton was a viable candidate in the democratic nomination process many of our members felt a passionate need to return the loyalty she has earned over decades of support
7330001 physics is like sex sure it may give some practical results but thats not why we do it
7330002 tsvangirais claims that president mbeki refused to meet him are absolute rubbish you cant just meet the president whenever you like we must follow protocol and respect our president

7330006 the clock is running make the most of today time waits for no man yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift thats why it is called the present
7330007 when hillary clinton speaks at the democratic national convention on wednesday night she will blow this ad out of the water
7330008 this was a hard fought and very long race and as youve already said 21 debates i mean you say a lot of things you try and get an edge over your opponent but right now i dont think theres any question at all that the clintons are wholeheartedly behind barack obama they want to see a democrat elected president of the united states
7330009 hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters whove been following her for a long time but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast because hes a tremendously engaging guy a tremendously bright guy and a guy whos sort of harry truman like he tells it like it is
7330010 well first of all let me say that i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7330011 cindys father barely finished high school went off and distinguished himself in world war ii in a b 17 and he came back with practically nothing and realized the american dream and i am proud and grateful for that and i think he is a role model to many young americans who serve in the military and come back and succeed
7330012 so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it
7330013 we spend our time primarily in washington d c where i have a condominium in crystal city here in this beautiful sedona that im blessed every moment i can spend here our condominium in phoenix arizona and a place over in san diego the others are also for investment purposes so all i can say is i am blessed to have the opportunity to continue to be part of a country where you can succeed and do well
7330014 he says he has seven kitchen tables we dont want him to have an eighth kitchen table
7330015 and we understand that he has a wonderful life this
7330016 and so when john mccain gets up in the morning and he leaves his house to lock his door he has to shuffle through a number of keys to figure out which key works in which door in which home hes at at any given time that suggests bob a significant disconnect from the average american who is experiencing quite a different economy than the one john mccain has been advocating
7330017 theyre going to say look john mccain good man american hero but he wants to extend the bush administration
7330018 of course were going to fire back and we should fire back
7330019 but it can be done in a way thats poetic and substantive

7330080 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7330081 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7330082 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7330083 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad

7330096 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body

7330161 wir t rken es sind die nein zur europ ischen union sagen
7330162 aber wir erwarten dass ein rechtsstaat uns vor solchen provokationen sch tzt
7330163 wir werden ihn nicht aufge ben wir werden unsere identit t nicht verleugnen es ist nicht ihre sache uns zu sagen wer wir sind wir wissen seit jahrhunderten wer wir sind
7330164 wir wollen die sem titel keinen politischen kontext geben ein zweiter vatikan zu werden steht nicht in bereinstimmung mit den prinzipien der orthodoxen kirche
7330165 noch keine positiven fr chte dieses eu beitrittsprozesses erfahren unsere kirche hat noch keine positiven reformen und ver nderungen erlebt im gegenteil
7330166 am 30 januar hat der erziehungsminister gesagt es gebe keine gr nde das seminar von heybeli t rkischer name f r chalki nicht wieder zu aktivieren jetzt aber sagt man uns es sei eine bedrohung f r die staatssicherheit
7330167 ich protestiere da gegen dass die beh rden diesen prozess laufen lassen der unsere not immer schlimmer macht
7330168 wir sind in bedr ngnis wir f hlen uns nicht gerecht behandelt die lage entwickelt sich vom schlechten zum schlechteren
7330169 wir hoffen und w nschen dass es einen fairen beitrittsprozess f r die t rkische republik gibt inklusive eines ffentlich erkl rten m glichen eu beitrittstermins der eu beitrittsprozess soll f r regierung und volk ein ansporn f r tiefe verifizierbare reformen werden

7330171 eine tiefe sorge ob der berichte die wir erhielten es schmerzt uns von der ffentlichen kritik und den angriffen zu lesen die auf sie selbst und auf die christliche gemeinschaft in der t rkei er folgten solche eine feindschaft muss sehr schwer zu ertragen sein besonders da sie noch das gef hl der isolation mit sich bringt
7330172 von unserer solidarit t in gedanken und gebe ten in dieser schwierigen zeit
7330173 dies nur ein weiteres beispiel f r die integrit t die sie als ein f hrer der weltweiten orthodoxen kirche wie auch in der ku menischen bewegung gezeigt haben wo sie unerm dlich die sache des dialogs der ver s hnung und des friedens in der welt vertreten haben
7330174 darum bem ht sein werden das kumenische patriarchat bei seinem nachdenken ber unsere gemeinsame christliche verantwortung f r die zukunft europas zu begleiten
7330175 wir verlangen die volle anerkennung der historischen und international best tigten rechte des kumenischen patriarchats
7330176 der sunnitische islam ist quasi staatsreligion alle anderen bekenntnisse gerade auch die christlichen haben wenig bewegungsfreiheit

7330181 within the next 10 years the u s china israel and a host of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon so if and when they plant a flag does that give them property rights a nasa working group hosted a discussion this week to ask who owns the moon the answer of course is no one the outer space treaty the international law signed by more than 100 countries states that the moon and other celestial bodies are the province of all mankind no doubt that would irk all of the people throughout the ages like monks from the middle ages who have tried to claim the moon was theirs but ownership is different from property rights people who rent apartments for example dont own where they live but they still hold rights so with all of the upcoming missions to visit the moon and beyond space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush cowboy style

7330187 ill refrain from reviewing the machine until i have something good to say i will say that the software is light years from being complete
7330188 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7330189 when the ban came to wales i wrote an article against it i had what i thought then were reasonable arguments against the ban crowds of smokers cluttering the pavements outside any pub restaurant bar or club raising nuisance noise levels and creating a serious litter problem even the anti social segmentation between friends those who like a ciggie outside those who dont inside with the smokers happy in their own hazy huddle of smoke outside i even argued about a persons right to smoke in certain public places if he she so wished how silly those arguments seem now how out of touch how archaic even and how wrong about 40 000 people in the uk die every year from lung cancer it is the most common form of cancer in britain and the most common cause of death from cancer in both men and women although it affects more men than women lung cancer is caused by tobacco smoke and although non smokers can suffer from lung cancer too the risk of developing this awful disease is about 30 to 40 times higher than if you dont smoke only about 10 per cent of patients with lung cancer can expect to be still alive five years after diagnosis sadly most lung cancer is diagnosed too late for curative treatment to be possible and as bob humphrys discovered the course of lung cancer is brutally short
7330190 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7330191 its a cookout its a picnic its a bratfest its not a barbecue
7330192 just the place for a snark i have said it twice
7330193 its definitely something that has to be addressed because of what i do for this team and what ive done since ive been here bringing this team from one of the bottom teams in the league to a playoff team to a team that won 49 games
7330194 i wont be comfortable going into this season knowing i have to play this whole season being the fifth highest paid and not get an extension i would not be happy
7330195 consolidated to allow for an additional full term elective course in the second semester of the first year the revised core curriculum is organized into
7330196 organizations focuses on organizational change and the importance of social networks and interpersonal skills
7330197 mans greatest good fortune is to chase and defeat his enemy seize his total possessions leave his married women weeping and wailing ride his gelding and use the bodies of his women as a nightshirt and support
7330198 he butchered three of them with an ax and decapitated them in other words instead of using a gun to kill them he took a hatchet to chop their heads off he struggled face to face with one of them and throwing down his ax managed to break his neck and devour his flesh in front of his comrades i award him the medal of the republic
7330199 appeasing of governments which revel in slaughter is an invitation to worldwide catastrophe
7330200 i will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger tips off them and slay them wherever ye catch them
7330201 give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness
7330202 cover not truth with falsehood nor conceal the truth when ye know what it is
7330203 treat with kindness your parents and kindred and orphans and those in need
7330204 the leaders of the ussr and of england and the president of the united states are infidels every part of the body of a non moslem individual is impure even the hair on his head and his body hair his nails and all the secretions of his body any man or woman who denies the existence of god or believes in his partners the christian trinity or else does not believe in his prophet mohammed is impure in the same way as are excrement urine dog and wine sic
7330205 islam does not allow peace between a moslem and an infidel
7330206 the leaders of our religion were all soldiers commanders and warriors
7330207 this idea of turning the other cheek has been wrongly attributed to jesus peace be unto him it is those barbaric imperialists that have attributed it to him jesus was a prophet and no prophet can be so illogical
7330208 on saturday we will kill the jews on sunday we will kill the christians
7330209 soon it islam will take over all of america then the world
7330210 dont believe that we want an islamic republic in lebanon what hezbollah wants is a world islamic republic
7330211 i even venture sometimes to say that islam was not meant to serve the early days of islam when life was primitive and when social institutions were still stable and working it was meant to be put in a freezer and to be taken out when it will be really needed and i believe that the time has come the mission of islam lies not in the past but in the future
7330212 islam is a tree that feeds on blood and grows on severed limbs
7330213 is a defensive social and political movement a reaction to westernization and modernization
7330214 an attempt to restore an old civilization not create a new empire
7330215 imitative responses of muslims to the challenge of the west
7330216 many in the arab and muslim world view the history of islam and of the muslim worlds dealings with the west as one of victimization and oppression at the hands of an expansive imperial power
7330217 the radicals do not have a broad base of popular support even in lebanon however where such groups flourish a poll of university students taken in 1987 indicated that more than 90 disapproved of assassinations hostage taking and sabotage of government installations
7330218 there may be only a thin line between the open mainstream movements and their clandestine violent counterparts
7330219 the islamic revival is not only here to stay but is likely to be a leading domestic political force shaping the mediterranean region during the coming decades despite political vicissitudes the various movements loosely collected under the rubric of islamic fundamentalism have shown a staying power that indicates they have achieved both breadth and depth in their indigenous societies
7330220 to propose a monolithic view of islam and then equate it with fundamentalism would be wrong except for mass followings in algeria and tunisia fundamentalists represent a small segment although a popular vocal and highly motivated one of the total population hamdani overlooks the sudan and afghanistan both of which at this writing were in fundamentalist hands even in iran which appears to be totally convulsed in fundamentalism it is a small minority that has monopolized power
7330221 any nonreligious i e non islamic power whatever form or shape is necessarily an atheistic power the tool of satan it is part of our duty to stand in its path and to struggle against its effects such satanic power can engender nothing but corruption on earth the supreme evil which must be pitilessly fought and rooted out to achieve that end we have no recourse other than to overthrow all governments that do not rest on pure islamic principles and are thus corrupt and corrupting and to tear down the traitorous rotten unjust and tyrannical administrative systems that serve them if islamic civilization had governed the west we would no longer have to put up with these barbaric goings on unworthy even of wild animals western governments are using inhuman laws and inhuman political methods misdeeds must be punished by the law of retaliation cut off the hands of the thief kill the murderer instead of putting him in prison flog the adulterous woman or man your concerns your humanitarian scruples are more childish than reasonable

7330251 kita berpegang kepada perlembagaan negara apa apa pun yang kita nak buat dari segi dasar ia mestilah selaras dengan perlembagaan negara dan perlembagaan telah menetapkan agama islam sebagai agama rasmi
7330252 di samping itu agama agama lain ada hak untuk diamalkan secara bebas tidak payahlah dap jadikan ini sebagai isu
7330253 sebab itu kita sudah menyatakan sejak awal bahawa pakatan ini rapuh kerana mereka sekadar nak menolak barisan nasional bn dan bukanlah satu pakatan yang boleh menjadi alternatif kepada bn

7330255 jelas sekali anwar dah sanggup menjadi alat kepada dap dan apa apa yang dia cakap pun dah selari dengan apa yang dituntut oleh dap selama ini
7330256 sewaktu dalam umno dulu dia kutuk dan kata macam macam kepada dap tetapi hari ini kerana nak jadi pm perdana menteri dia sanggup bersekongkol dengan dap dalam semua pendirian walaupun ia memberi kesan negatif kepada politik negara

7330258 kita boleh nampak dengan jelas walaupun nallakaruppan telah disaman oleh anwar namun beliau tidak gentar dan hanya menunggu masa untuk mendedahkan mengenai perkara itu
7330259 nallakaruppan melakukan pendedahan itu dalam satu majlis yang dianjurkan oleh pemuda umno dan kalau perkara tersebut tidak benar takkan beliau berani membuat kenyataan demikian

7330312 im increasingly interested in more gamer oriented online games not based on subscription billing models our investment in riot games grew out of this thinking weve seen strong evidence that this combination works in the chinese and korean markets but its been slow to take off here it is going to take the right game to unlock this market but it could be huge
7330313 free to play gaming and virtual worlds monetized through up sold virtual goods and subscriptions are gaining increasing traction in the west
7330314 companies like k2 runescape jagex gameforge eve ccp and bigpoint all doing revenues now in the tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars but gaming like media is not a winner take all business and there are many up and coming companies building free to play experiences and growing fast
7330315 w ith the death of retail and the greater accessibility of games in the hands of an order of magnitude larger audience
7330316 free to play with some premium components becomes the most logical conclusion then of course with alternate billing models comes alternate payment systems
7330317 we are still at the cusp of a sea change in the gaming space that rivals that of web 1 0 in scope

7330417 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician
7330418 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7330419 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion
7330420 senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7330421 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7330422 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7330423 this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy
7330424 i dont think we can answer that at this point
7330425 i think one of the unanswered questions going forward in the primaries is whether or not sen obama can close the deal with these voters
7330426 i think people make these decisions on a very needs driven basis and you can see it in the clinton polling data the people that really need help from the government are for hillary
7330427 the more you like senator clinton the more likely you are to be for senator obama
7330428 theres been a tremendous amount of healing and senator clinton deserves a great deal of credit for that
7330429 how could you consider selecting someone who opposed the federal partial birth abortion ban and was one of the eleven original cosponsors of the radical freedom of choice act as your vice president

7330431 i think i made it very clear saturday night i have a pro life record that i have pro life policies and my administration will have pro life policies
7330432 theres already been things out there in the media hes already made up his mind hes going to announce on such and such a day
7330433 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms
7330434 obviously were going to be announcing soon because we have no choice but ive got to tell you its one of the toughest things ive ever done
7330435 from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades now
7330436 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities

7330455 celebro esta decisi n como presidente del equipo porque eso significa que la dedicaci n de pastor ser total y eso redundar en beneficio nuestro
7330456 el que haya pensado que ha utilizado su situaci n para fichar jugadores es un hip crita y un ignorante porque es un gran profesional y siempre ha sabido separar un cargo de otro
7330457 el problema es que hay muchos dirigentes en asobal que se piensan que saben mucho y no saben nada y con cr ticas como las que se han vertido sobre juan carlos pastor queda claro que los que fallamos somos los dirigentes y no los deportistas ni los t cnicos
7330458 el sustituto de pastor ser un valiente porque alcanzar el curr culum dejado por l con un campeonato del mundo un subcampeonato de europa y una medalla de bronce ol mpica ser tremendamente complicado y por eso le deseo mucha suerte
7330459 juan carlos pastor le pese a quien le pese ha marcado un hito en la historia del balonmano espa ol que va a ser dif cilmente superable y entiendo que quiera dedicarse a su club y a su familia porque ser seleccionador le ha supuesto pasar mucho tiempo fuera de casa y tener mucha presi n pero se va con una maleta llena de t tulos

7330467 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose we wouldnt let her olympic career end that way
7330468 to lose by 30 against a quality team we believed we could win the gold medal against the usa you have to play a 40 minute game
7330469 we didnt play 40 minutes we shot the ball terrible defense has been one of our strengths through the tournament but we just werent great on our d today
7330470 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7330471 we just send wave after wave of players at you

7330486 it has been good for me to reflect on what happened at the beginning of the year
7330487 i feel i can hold my head high with the job i did in f1 and i see this from people i am speaking to in f1 that i am respected as a race driver and test driver now rather than just a test driver as it was before the super aguri experience

7330564 probably my most poignant seder memory is not with the bergers but what happened right after i came back from meeting golda meir in 1973 i had predicted that something was going on in egypt and i remember people talking about what it meant to them if israel were actually defeated
7330565 imagine our circumstance in the world were there no israel how many battleships would there be how many troops would be stationed
7330566 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq

7330568 he has to serve his sentence theres a rationale in my view why pollard should be given leniency but there is not a rationale to say what happened did not happen and should be pardoned

7330597 the first person that he obama sat down and talked to about this vice presidential issue was senator clinton they had a discussion back in early june and he spent more time with her talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else in the last couple of months

7330650 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7330651 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7330652 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7330653 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7330658 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7330659 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7330660 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7330661 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7330662 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7330663 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7330664 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7330665 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7330666 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7330667 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7330668 the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he wasnt real

7330671 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7330672 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7330673 estoy feliz de volver al f tbol paraguayo y en una instituci n como libertad que siempre aspira a cosas grandes
7330674 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7330675 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7330676 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7330677 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7330678 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7330679 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7330680 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7330681 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7330682 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7330683 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7330684 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7330685 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7330686 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7330687 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7330688 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7330689 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7330690 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7330691 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7330692 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7330693 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7330694 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7330695 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7330696 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7330697 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7330698 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7330699 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7330700 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7330701 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7330702 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7330715 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7330716 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7330717 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7330718 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7330719 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7330720 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7330721 ahora tenemos que mirar hacia adelante y mejorar el jueves en el partido contra el gyor
7330722 l gicamente nos sentimos muy decepcionados despu s de esta derrota tuvimos un partido dif cil porque el leverkusen dispuso de un buen equipo y jug muy bien en general nos falt movimiento y por eso hemos ido por detr s en la posesi n del bal n
7330723 leverkusen se present muy fuerte mientras que a nosotros nos falt agresividad y no supimos aprovechar nuestras posibilidades al cien por ciento creo que el rival se llev una merecida victoria
7330724 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7330725 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7330726 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7330727 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7330728 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7330729 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7330730 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7330731 who are open to doing something on the production side
7330732 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7330733 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7330734 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7330735 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7330736 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7330737 democrat delegates hotels banks military recruitment centers and governmental and police offices
7330738 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7330739 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7330740 who do you want to answer the phone at 3 a m
7330741 as long as clinton was a viable candidate in the democratic nomination process many of our members felt a passionate need to return the loyalty she has earned over decades of support
7330742 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7330743 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7330744 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7330745 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7330746 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7330747 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7330748 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

7330751 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7330785 china has won the most gold medals and the united states of america won the most total
7330786 i believe each country will highlight what suits it best one country will say gold medals the other country will say the total tally counts we take no position on that
7330787 in the end there wasnt much reason for me to smile
7330788 because the pressure of being a gold medalist is huge
7330789 according to preliminary information 20 out of 90 people on board survived
7330790 when hillary clinton speaks at the democratic national convention on wednesday night she will blow this ad out of the water
7330791 this was a hard fought and very long race and as youve already said 21 debates i mean you say a lot of things you try and get an edge over your opponent but right now i dont think theres any question at all that the clintons are wholeheartedly behind barack obama they want to see a democrat elected president of the united states
7330792 hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters whove been following her for a long time but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast because hes a tremendously engaging guy a tremendously bright guy and a guy whos sort of harry truman like he tells it like it is
7330793 well first of all let me say that i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7330794 cindys father barely finished high school went off and distinguished himself in world war ii in a b 17 and he came back with practically nothing and realized the american dream and i am proud and grateful for that and i think he is a role model to many young americans who serve in the military and come back and succeed
7330795 so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it
7330796 we spend our time primarily in washington d c where i have a condominium in crystal city here in this beautiful sedona that im blessed every moment i can spend here our condominium in phoenix arizona and a place over in san diego the others are also for investment purposes so all i can say is i am blessed to have the opportunity to continue to be part of a country where you can succeed and do well
7330797 he says he has seven kitchen tables we dont want him to have an eighth kitchen table
7330798 and we understand that he has a wonderful life this
7330799 and so when john mccain gets up in the morning and he leaves his house to lock his door he has to shuffle through a number of keys to figure out which key works in which door in which home hes at at any given time that suggests bob a significant disconnect from the average american who is experiencing quite a different economy than the one john mccain has been advocating
7330800 theyre going to say look john mccain good man american hero but he wants to extend the bush administration
7330801 of course were going to fire back and we should fire back
7330802 but it can be done in a way thats poetic and substantive

7330805 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7330806 i cant say at all that we have confidence in israel
7330807 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7330808 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel

7330817 i heard some things that there were three or four gun shot wounds and that it was about an hour and a half until he was found
7330818 people said he clambered in to a garden and fell in to the garden
7330819 this was a young man of 24 with his life before him and i would like to send out an appeal for calm because this is another life that has been wasted
7330820 where individuals have friction between them we ask that they try to work that out work with the police work with other partners and other agencies to try and resolve the issues
7330821 when there is a shooting in birmingham tensions between gangs do arise and as part of keeping an open mind if this does end up being part of a gang dispute then we would appeal for calm
7330822 we are very very worried were very concerned and questions have to be asked of the authorities
7330823 were calling on the police to take more action to ensure that the public are protected
7330824 in politics when you want to bury bad news you make sure it hits late friday and saturday so why did barack obama hold off on his announcement of joe biden as his veep pick until the slowest possible news cycle
7330825 by waiting until the weekend barack obama was able to skirt any and all scrutiny public vetting or criticism by rush limbaugh and the rest of conservative talk radio and cable television in other words he wanted no bad news and was confident he would get ample positive coverage from the mainstream media
7330826 the media is putty in the hands of barack obama

7331100 hasta ahora poco se sab a de los mecanismos neurales que distinguen ambos tipos de duelo explican los investigadores en la revista especializada neuroimage 4 pero se hab an considerado algunos mecanismos hipot ticos como la actividad relacionada con el dolor con la angustia social por la p rdida y la actividad relacionada con la recompensa con los comportamientos de apego una de las investigadoras la doctora mary frances oconnor declar para la publicaci n de la ucla que en lo que se refiere al mecanismo de recompensa la idea es que mientras nuestros seres queridos est n vivos obtenemos se ales gratificantes cuando los vemos o cuando vemos objetos que nos los recuerdan tras la muerte de un ser allegado los que se adaptan a la p rdida dejan de obtener esta recompensa neural por el contrario los que no consiguen adaptarse contin an anhel ndola porque cada vez que ven una se al del ser querido a n obtienen la recompensa neural correspondiente todo este mecanismo sucede a nivel inconsciente es decir que el doliente no pone en ello ninguna intenci n el estudio se centr en analizar si las personas que sufren de duelo complicado presentan una mayor actividad tanto en el circuito de recompensa del cerebro como en el circuito del dolor para ello fueron analizadas 23 mujeres que hab an sufrido la p rdida de sus madres o de alguna hermana como consecuencia del c ncer de mama
7331101 el estudio respalda por tanto la hip tesis de que los apegos activan los circuitos de recompensa y pueden por tanto convertirse en una interferencia para la adaptaci n a las p rdidas es decir que aunque la activaci n del n cleo accumbens no satisfaga emocionalmente a los dolientes se ala oconnor se convierte en una respuesta que hace a n m s dif cil de superar la realidad del fallecimiento
7331102 puede llegar a generar el anhelo recurrente de emociones dolorosas como la ansiedad intensa o el deseo de morir ahora este s ndrome ha sido definido por un conjunto de criterios emp ricos y se est considerando su inclusi n en el manual diagn stico y estad stico de los trastornos mentales de la american psychiatric association asociaci n psiqui trica de estados unidos el dsm iv este manual consiste en una clasificaci n de los trastornos mentales con el prop sito de proporcionar descripciones claras de stos para facilitar sus diagn sticos

7331111 listen nothing wrong i just wanted to say i am thrilled with joe biden as my vice president the conversations weve been having over the last couple of days make me absolutely convinced he is the right man for the job hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots hes got the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crisis that may come up more importantly i think he can help shape a long term strategy to keep america more secure and move us out of the disasterous economic and foreign policies that have characterized the last eight years i am very excited about the convention i cant wait to hear michelles speech tomorrow i will tell you that i did get a little preview of the video they did of her and she was extraordinary and i think you guys will enjoy it very much and i am still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the other three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people are going to face in november all right lets get back up

7331122 comfortable in hebrew and had relations in israeli society but as an arab palestinian in a state based upon religious supremacy and privileges he could only stand at a distance he could only stay in the inferior status still reserved for arab citizens of the state
7331123 mahmoud darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging exquisitely tuned singer of images that invoke link and shine a brilliant light into the worlds whole heart what he speaks has been embraced by readers around the world his in an utterly necessary voice unforgettable once discovered
7331124 i will continue to humanize even the enemy the first teacher who taught me hebrew was a jew the first love affair in my life was with a jewish girl the first judge who sent me to prison was a jewish woman so from the beginning i didnt see jews as devils or angels but as human beings
7331125 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
7331126 we should not justify suicide bombers we are against the suicide bombers but we must understand what drives these young people to such actions they want to liberate themselves from such a dark life it is not ideological it is despair
7331127 why are we always told that we cannot solve our problem without solving the existential anxiety of the israelis and their supporters who have ignored our very existence for decades in our own homeland
7331128 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7331129 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7331130 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia

7331133 the manager has bigged me up as the main man hes supported me massively
7331134 i came back in pre season in good condition and he told me id be the main striker and id get the goals his man management is excellent i only showed it in flashes last season and i know i can do it week in week out
7331135 ive always aimed high and id love to play in the premier league with charlton
7331136 the skys the limit if i can keep working hard for the team and putting the goals away ive scored 27 in a season for crewe but id be delighted with 15
7331137 the team is based around luke but sometimes he lacks belief

7331151 ha subrayado la necesidad de contar con servicios p blicos que propicien una correcta procuraci n e impartici n de justicia y que respeten los derechos humanos
7331152 hoy m s que nunca existe la necesidad de cumplir en los tres mbitos de gobierno los retos que la reforma penal implica y as lograr su exacta aplicaci n pues de no hacerlo se corre el riesgo de vivir en el caos m s importante de la historia
7331153 no caben las afirmaciones absolutas que condicionan la viabilidad de un proyecto de reforma y tal vez subordin ndola tambi n ante la falta de recursos econ micos
7331154 tampoco podemos reducir el tema a quienes dicen si no pueden renuncien y que hoy muchos abanderan editando el dolor absolutamente respetable de un ciudadano mezquinamente manipulado para incrementar la percepci n negativa logrando con ello detonar una campa a irracional de cuestionamiento
7331155 asumimos la magnitud del reto y por ello los poderes judiciales de los estados y las procuradur as generales nos hemos pronunciado por cumplir a cabalidad cada uno de los objetivos y acciones del acuerdo nacional que todos los sectores del pa s suscribieron el pasado jueves
7331156 castigar con cadena perpetua el delito cuando se comete bajo ciertas modalidades como el asesinato o la mutilaci n de la v ctima
7331157 esta posible ley general del secuestro simplemente homologar a los tipos penales en toda la rep blica sin perjuicio de la competencia del orden com n que corresponde a este delito y cuando esto pueda ser considerado por la pgr en funci n de tratarse de delincuencia organizada
7331158 sabemos que tenemos frente a nosotros la gran oportunidad de transformar nuestro sistema de justicia penal mediante la aplicaci n exitosa de la reciente reforma constitucional en la materia
7331159 no hay pretexto todos somos responsables de edificar un nuevo sistema de justicia un sistema que deje atr s los vicios generados por m s de un siglo en el sistema mixto aplicado desde la constituci n de 1917 que deje atr s el sistema escrito que se ha caracterizado por su lentitud por la ausencia de los jueces en las audiencias y por la falta de objetividad que ello genera

7331164 we had poor marking and not much pressure on the ball
7331165 all basic mistakes were happy that its an exhibition game against such a quality opponent because they stretch you show you what your weaknesses are and allow you to improve
7331166 i think were starting to find whats our best way to play
7331167 at least were learning who can do what we talked at halftime about coming out in the second half and seeing how we could improve the fact we were able to go 0 0 in the second half theres something to be gained by that
7331168 i think were a good team but were not playing well yet
7331169 that comes maybe from expectations and so many new players who we are trying to fit in and mold into a team
7331170 yes we know that what we have done isnt nearly as rigorous as the testing that has been done by others and that it is not as accurate precise as the work done by others e g kodak wilhelm and livick

7331247 i dont really get why bitchy jones is the de facto standard of what a dominant woman is she is just one person writing about fucking her stable why not just live and let live
7331248 her ranting style detracts from any serious points that she may be trying to make it all sounds like sour grapes to me
7331249 it is rather frustrating when she is being discussed on tv as having such an influential and well read blog and yet has such narrow minded opinions
7331250 i do not think that bj is a dominant i do not think that bj is a woman and it really does not matter to me whatever bjs blog might have been worth has disappeared over the term of the blog it has devolved the same way that the news media has it is all about attention and shock bj is just another sanctimonious attention whore
7331251 im not particularly impressed by anything shes written but to each their own im sure there are guys wanking to it at this moment
7331252 personally i find bitchy jones more annoying than elise sutton
7331253 i could have agreed with and even sympathized with bitchy jones had she just refrained from the cheap shots and the insinuations that attractive pro dommes are fake undominant money grubbing bimbos
7331254 her rants about the word domme strap ons and feminization are just annoying
7331255 the profanity while plenty gratuitous lacks any sense of appreciation for the art
7331256 im not up in her business telling her shes not a real dominant because shes not hot so why is she trying to say that people like me who are attractive pro dommes are just a male manufactured joke

7331276 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7331277 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7331278 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7331279 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7331280 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old

7331287 the family have been supportive of the investigation and very pleased with the result today
7331288 police inquiries are being made to determine the criminal liability of any other parties who may be involved
7331289 these survey results give some clear messages to both business and government about protecting information in order to retain customer trust
7331290 perhaps this was partly due to making the question clearer but it shows that business is not alone in needing to embrace privacy as an issue
7331291 although at least 600 000 kiwis live overseas only 28 000 voted in the 2005 general election
7331292 our every vote counts campaign will help redress that imbalance by reaching tens of thousands of eligible voters overseas and encouraging them to enrol and vote
7331293 our research shows that lack of information contributes to effectively disenfranchising tens of thousands of eligible voters who want to vote
7331294 yet despite these aspirations in 2005 only 28 000 of an estimated half a million eligible new zealanders living overseas actually voted

7331308 our take home message today is that the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery wtc 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings it did not collapse from explosives or from diesel fuel fires it collapsed because fires similar to those experienced in other tall buildings burned in the absence of water supply to operate the sprinklers and burned beyond the ability of firefighters to control fires it fell because thermal expansion a phenomenon not considered in current building design practice caused a fire induced progressive collapse

7331310 to apply thermite to a large steel column approximately 0 13 lb of thermite would be needed to heat and melt each pound of steel for a steel column that weighs approximately 1 000 lbs per foot at least 100 lbs of thermite would need to be placed around the column ignited and remain in contact with the vertical steel surface as the thermite reaction took place this is for one column presumably more than one column would have been prepared with thermite if this approach were to be used
7331311 unlikely that 100 lbs of thermite or more could have been carried into wtc 7 and placed around columns without being detected either prior to sept 11 or during that day

7331317 im comfortable with anybody who wants to gut it out but if that isnt enough for us to win then i have to make a decision about that
7331318 you have a young pitcher whos 27 years old and hes trying to pitch differently than he did earlier in the year in terms of his velocity and that type of thing john maine wants to pitch he wants to gut it out and weve been assured he cant injure himself more than he has
7331319 thats going to be a though thing for us to evaluate or to see john maine and maybe not see what we saw earlier in terms of velocity he wants to do this he wants to pitch he loves to pitch but we really have to look at this situation
7331320 once youve got something thats the way it was presented to me by the mets medical staff

7331360 another weakness found in altogether too many people is the habit of measuring everything and everyone by their own impressions and beliefs some people who read this book will believe that no one can think and grow rich they cannot think in terms of wealth and riches because their thought habits have been steeped in poverty want misery failure and defeat you dont have to look far for illustration of this point consider how you look upon people of other nationalities and cultures physically you think of your own appearance as the base for normal and find their looks to be exotic and different few of us stop very often to consider that on the flip side from the outsiders point of view you are the person who looks unique another simple case in point accents wherever you are from whatever the accent you speak with that is what sounds right or normal to you when a visitor from another part of the country or world arrives or moves in you find their speech to be interesting maybe even strange no doubt however that same person is thinking the same of the way you and nearly everyone else in your region talks we recognize this phenomenon in modern society as a level of ignorance yet we have difficulty truly overcoming it and sometimes even make conclusions about a person because they do not speak or look like us

7331363 deus ex should be one of the games blamed for the dilution of rpgs into fps hybrids not lauded as something great amp revolutionary
7331364 my point is this nbc went out of its way to let us know about the relationships even showing us kisses of a number of bigtime and smalltime athletes but all the athletes were significant in some way so was mitcham he prevented the chinese from sweeping gold in diving his story is truly one of the best of the games the reason why is because the sports world is for the most part an incredibly macho arena and many people including both athletes and fans have the mistaken belief that you cant be gay and be an athlete letting viewers know that mitcham is gay wouldve in my mind helped more people athletes and fans realize that any individual regardless of their sexual orientation can be a great competitor and an olympic champion

7331389 at this point we cant talk about anything because we havent seen it

7331391 the important thing is that it did nothing to challenge the creation or existence of that district
7331392 we have a number of other options available that were pursuing
7331393 well have to look at the ruling and fine print on the thing and see what the impacts going to be

7331395 buddy harman set the standard both quantitatively and qualitatively for what a great country drummer should be

7331397 hes nashvilles all around drummer and hes the best drummer i ever worked with
7331398 if anybody could be called the father of modern country drumming it would be buddy he defined the role of the drums in country music no matter the song he knew what to play more importantly he knew what not to play always
7331399 with a great musician you feel the soul and the spirit not the genre
7331400 i remember him with red pants red shirt with the collar turned up a black belt and black boots he always had the coolest car and the coolest drums and he was the consummate studio musician
7331401 buddy was articulate at any dynamic or tempo anybody that says they didnt copy buddy is a liar he was an innovator im telling you man the guy was unbelievable
7331402 he had such a great musical mind but he was also such a kind nice person
7331403 buddy was funny in the studio and he kept everybody feeling good
7331404 i asked him once what the strangest thing he played was
7331405 and in spite of how great he was he didnt have a pretentious bone in his body he was a beautiful guy

7331410 dont touch the stove because it is hot and could burn you
7331411 o ne way to help students see the value of the lessons is to ask the student either online or in an initial face to face meeting to do some reflection on what they expect to learn how they might use it in the future or how it will help them to meet their goals
7331412 i t is incumbent upon the instructor to review these reflections and to adjust the technology or suggest an individual lesson structure to more effectively meet student needs
7331413 t here must be some way to help learners who are still moving into the self directed mode

7331492 these survey results give some clear messages to both business and government about protecting information in order to retain customer trust
7331493 perhaps this was partly due to making the question clearer but it shows that business is not alone in needing to embrace privacy as an issue
7331494 although at least 600 000 kiwis live overseas only 28 000 voted in the 2005 general election
7331495 our every vote counts campaign will help redress that imbalance by reaching tens of thousands of eligible voters overseas and encouraging them to enrol and vote
7331496 our research shows that lack of information contributes to effectively disenfranchising tens of thousands of eligible voters who want to vote
7331497 yet despite these aspirations in 2005 only 28 000 of an estimated half a million eligible new zealanders living overseas actually voted
7331498 surely you wouldnt ask a sweet comfortable pup like me to get down
7331499 i threw in a few questions about energy drinks mostly because of what i observed in a nephew of mine he was drinking a lot of energy drinks and suddenly becoming explosive blowing up at his family when he was never that way before i wondered if the caffeine was part of it
7331500 this research doesnt mean the energy drinks cause the behavior
7331501 frequent energy drink consumption may be a red flag or warning sign for identifying a young person at higher risk for health compromising behavior
7331502 college kids have the misconception that you dont get a drunk with the caffeine from energy drinks
7331503 their speech isnt as slurred and they have less fatigue so they can dance until 3 but still wrap a car around a tree on the way home and bartenders cant tell as easily who to stop serving
7331504 youre every bit as drunk youre just an awake drunk
7331505 some teens as you might expect called assuring me they drink lots of energy drink with no problems
7331506 but other young callers talked about drinking three or four energy drinks in a row then not being able to drive a car or feeling bad enough to go to an emergency room
7331507 if we discover a desire within us that nothing in this world can satisfy also we should begin to wonder if perhaps we were created for another world

7331516 ganar la medalla de oro en pek n fue algo impresionante algo nico que no se consigue todos los d as la verdad es que estoy muy feliz y contento por haber marcado dos goles a brasil en las semifinales porque para los argentinos este partido es un cl sico
7331517 schalke se trata de un rival muy duro porque todos los equipos alemanes son fuertes no va a ser nada f cil eliminarles pero hay que estar tranquilos y confiar en la victoria
7331518 llegar en plenas condiciones para jugar el partido ahora quiero descansar un poco y pensar de lleno en el encuentro ojal pasemos y nosotros vamos a hacer todo lo posible para conseguirlo
7331519 la consigna principal es tener paciencia porque podemos darle la vuelta a la eliminatoria no hay que recordar los partidos ante el bolton y el valencia todos los encuentros son diferentes y hablamos de temporadas distintas
7331520 debemos llevar el ritmo del partido y estar metidos en todo momentos en la eliminatoria para conseguir un buen resultado
7331521 es una cuesti n que nos preocupa a todos sabemos que su fuerte en ataque es el juego por alto y debemos tratar de contrarrestarlo
7331522 schalke es un equipo con jugadores de bastante nivel y que cuenta con recambios habr que ver c mo llegan al partido pero debemos ocuparnos de nosotros mismos y tratar de llevar el ritmo de partido
7331523 la adaptaci n es lenta para m es importante aprender castellano y poder comunicarme en el campo entenderme con mis compa eros

7331525 es en el centro detr s del delantero me siento m s c modo pero he aprendido a jugar en muchas posiciones a la izquierda o a la derecha y en el centro del campo o m s adelante all donde me necesite el t cnico
7331526 se puede decir que est hecho pero es un partido importante que tenemos que jugar
7331527 ahorita se le da prioridad a j venes y naturalizados
7331528 uno como jugador siempre tiene la ilusi n de ser tomado en cuenta por la selecci n sin embargo en mi caso creo que ya pas mi ciclo pues ahora viene una nueva generaci n conformada por buenos jugadores j venes que juegan en europa y sobre todo muchas convocatorias a los naturalizados pero esperemos que se le de m s oportunidad a los j venes para que contin en con un buen desarrollo
7331529 no creo que mi edad sea algo que me impida ser tomado en cuenta pero ahorita s lo estoy enfocado en tratar de cumplir las metas de mi equipo tengo varios a os en este club y quiero ser campe n lo antes posible con monterrey eso es lo nico que pasa por mi mente en estos momentos
7331530 nunca he compartido la idea de convocar a un jugador naturalizado y mucho menos si hay quienes est n haciendo las cosas mejor a los que est n ahorita pero son decisiones del t cnico y no hay nada que hacer dijo arellano refiri ndose al brasile o leandro augusto y los argentinos mat as vuoso y guillermo franco

7331541 47 and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people 48 now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he hold him fast 49 and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and kissed him 50 and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on jesus and took him
7331542 1 now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end
7331543 4 nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love 5 remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent
7331544 14 but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication 15 so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitanes which thing i hate 16 repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth
7331545 1 and unto the angel of the church in sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead 2 be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god 3 remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee
7331546 48 now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he hold him fast 49 and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and kissed him
7331547 25 there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death
7331548 23 o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps
7331549 30 and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book 31 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
7331550 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord 9 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
7331551 1 brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved 2 for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge 3 for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god
7331552 5 and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself
7331553 9 for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god 10 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me
7331554 12 not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus 13 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before 14 i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus
7331555 3 then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot being of the number of the twelve 4 and he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him unto them
7331556 70 jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil 71 he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve
7331557 23 but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men
7331558 21 and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me 22 and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him lord is it i 23 and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me 24 the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born 25 then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i he said unto him thou hast said
7331559 31 then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad 32 but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee 33 peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended 34 jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice 35 peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples
7331560 47 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven
7331561 21 from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day
7331562 22 and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men 23 and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again and they were exceeding sorry
7331563 46 and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
7331564 18 and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers 19 and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men 20 and they straightway left their nets and followed him 21 and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them 22 and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him
7331565 1 and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart 2 and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light
7331566 23 now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved
7331567 26 when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son
7331568 2 then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him
7331569 7 therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea
7331570 20 then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee
7331571 24 this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true
7331572 40 and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour 41 watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
7331573 43 and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy
7331574 o my father if it is possible let this cup pass from me
7331575 39 and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt
7331576 42 he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done
7331577 44 and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words
7331578 if this cup cannot pass away from me unless i drink it 42 he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done
7331579 6 be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god 7 and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus
7331580 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession 15 for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin 16 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need
7331581 26 and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body 27 and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it 28 for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins 29 but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom 30 and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives
7331582 1 observe the month of abib and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the month of abib the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night 2 thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flock and the herd in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there 3 thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life 4 and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days neither shall there any thing of the flesh which thou sacrificedst the first day at even remain all night until the morning 5 thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee 6 but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even at the going down of the sun at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt 7 and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the lord thy god shall choose and thou shalt turn in the morning and go unto thy tents 8 six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the lord thy god thou shalt do no work therein
7331583 1 and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying 2 this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you 3 speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house 4 and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb 5 your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats 6 and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening 7 and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it 8 and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it 9 eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the purtenance thereof 10 and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire 11 and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the lords passover 12 for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord 13 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt 14 and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever 15 seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel 16 and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done of you 17 and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever 18 in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even 19 seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a stranger or born in the land 20 ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread 21 then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the passover 22 and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the bason and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning 23 for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you 24 and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever 25 and it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service 26 and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service 27 that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the lords passover who passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped 28 and the children of israel went away and did as the lord had commanded moses and aaron so did they
7331584 43 and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of the passover there shall no stranger eat thereof 44 but every mans servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof 45 a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof 46 in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof 48 and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof 49 one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you
7331585 1 now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end
7331586 27 wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord
7331587 29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body
7331588 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
7331589 42 and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers
7331590 7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight
7331591 29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body
7331592 46 and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
7331593 29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body
7331594 28 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup
7331595 1 we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain
7331596 14 for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead 15 and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again
7331597 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
7331598 counted the blood by which we were sanctified a common thing
7331599 26 for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins 27 but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries 28 he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses 29 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace
7331600 crucify again for themselves the son of god and put him to an shame
7331601 7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight
7331602 wait for one wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another
7331603 16 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ
7331604 1 now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye 2 upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come
7331605 that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom
7331606 that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god
7331607 16 for i say unto you i will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god
7331608 18 for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come
7331609 11 and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
7331610 2 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son 3 and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come 4 again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage 5 but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise 6 and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them 7 but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city 8 then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy 9 go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage 10 so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests 11 and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment 12 and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless 13 then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth 14 for many are called but few are chosen
7331611 9 and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god

7331700 i knew holmes brilliant analytical mind was hard at work
7331701 most penetrating news watson most penetrating surely you have read the papers already tell me what is the matter of most paramount interest in the news this morrow
7331702 well i should respectfully submit that it is the matter of the fluctuating polls
7331703 and the surprising lead taken by the conservative party of canada in the run up to the election
7331704 indeed watson indeed now certainly you are a most learned and partisan fellow who follows matters of politics closely because my primary occupational concern is crime and the belligerent element i am very much aware of political matters however i believe your own knowledge extends beyond mine so if you would be so kind as to enlighten me watson a quick refresher as it were on the primary political parties as it pertains directly to the case that so recently came to my attention
7331705 certainly holmes as youll recall the two principal parties are the conservative party of canada and the liberal party of canada headed respectively by one mr stephen harper and of course our prime minister paul martin mr harper is a devoted young standpat and achiever and mr martin a prominent industrialist currently mr martins liberals are embroiled in scandal after scandal which has plagued them since the unpleasant party leadership battles you might also recall the new democratic party headed by the rather peculiar utopian socialist mr jack layton and of course rebel separatist gille duceppe leader of the bloc quebecois
7331706 of course watson a very interesting cadre of political players however it would appear at this moment we need only be concerned with the first two furthermore the issue of the liberal leadership changes is of great concern but i digress it so happens that the telegram that most recently arrived has come from the higher powers of the liberal party they require our services and have requested that we should meet them this very afternoon in old ottawa town surely you wont disapprove of a hansom cab ride at this hour of the day watson
7331707 of course not holmes as you know i am always delighted to follow the exploits of your deductive consultations and offer what limited insight i can
7331708 then it is settled we shall be off at once
7331709 oh horror mr holmes horror we are faced with ruin utter ruination i tell you and it is sabotage there is nothing else for it but ruthless interference you must help us holmes you are the only one who can
7331710 you must help us holmes you are the only one who can
7331711 please mr reid collect yourself i am of no help unless you impart to me the full details of your conundrum
7331712 of course oh but they are most heinous the portents are utterly cruel and the gods frown upon us all i can only assume you have read the papers and seen the news the dastardly cpc have taken a 2 point lead oh woe to us it all began at the outset of campaign scandal after scandal has been leaked to the public under the duress of these damning allegations the simple public cannot comprehend that the liberal party must be elected for the common good and preservation of canada
7331713 i can only imagine that you have made the simple deduction that some agent is at work within your campaign bent on thwarting it
7331714 surely this is the case mr holmes and whats more we have several clues as to his identity last night one of our offices was burgled the thief managed to acquired some documents of utter importance documents whose revelation to the public would spell utter doom to our party and hence the country the bandit left little trace of his coming and going save this peculiar small white dimpled orb with the letters gmgc stenciled finely upon it also a watchman questioned after the incident made clear that an unsightly fellow seemed to be showing a keen interest in the office building and surrounding area
7331715 most enlightening this single clue and the revelations of the night watchman have made clear the vast majority of the case
7331716 but how can such a trivial and perplexing object finalize the matter what conclusions have you come to mr holmes i beg of you tell me now i am at my wits end
7331717 you will find dear sir that the matter is of trifling simplicity however there are yet one or two details to be cleared up watson and i must make a short trip on the completion of our venture we shall contact you with the complete details of the matter although i cannot promise that they will put your mind at ease
7331718 with that we left the wailing liberal campaigner and hailed a cab
7331719 well then watson have you managed to attain a rudimentary grasp of the case yet
7331720 i fear i can make neither heads nor tails of the matter nor do i understand how you might have solved it already
7331721 surely watson it is most elementary but worry not for it shall all be made clear in good time
7331722 i recall that on several previous undertakings you had presence of mind enough to pack your trusty revolver might i query if you have done so today
7331723 indeed i have holmes are you suggesting that there is danger afoot
7331724 if my deductions are correct then there may well be watson you are a sturdy fellow of stalwart bearing and constitution and we have seen much danger together i trust you are ready to face peril this day
7331725 very good i believe we have now reached our objective and the right words to the maid shall show us to the study of this particular residence
7331726 we are here on most urgent business i am sherlock holmes and this is dr watson we have only just returned from a conference at the local liberal party headquarters which has recently been burgled i was wondering if you could attest to the presence of this object found at the scene of the crime mr jean chretien
7331727 its quite simple watson the liberal scandals the recent polls the night watchmans peculiar account and the strange orb they all pointed to but one individual where the evidence meets you will always find your quarry
7331728 certainly holmes i can understand the scandal the witness and the polls but what on earth is the odd sphere
7331729 allow me to ask you this are you familiar with the peculiar gentlemans pursuit known as golf
7331730 certainly holmes just the other day lord effington explained to me the meaning of the term niner
7331731 well then what you should have recognized immediately is that this is a
7331732 fascinating holmes and yet utterly simple now that you have enlightened me of course the criminal did escape our grasp do you think it is possible that he survived
7331733 possible watson i am sure he is still alive not only that i am keenly aware of his whereabouts
7331734 you mean to tell me you know where he is
7331735 surely holmes we should set the constabulary upon his trail or even venture after him ourselves
7331736 all in good time dear watson all in good time i seem to recall that the next steamship destined for china doesnt depart until late next week until then i suggest we remove the matter from our minds
7331737 viene el presidente correa esta semana va a llegar el viernes o el s bado vamos a recibir a ese gran l der ecuatoriano sudamericano
7331738 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen in the best western raid makes this particularly rare the russian gangs who specialise in this kind of work will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available late on thursday night in the wrong hands theres enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7331739 large corporate companies rely on anti virus products to protect their infrastructure but the problem with this approach is that these products only detect around 60 of threats out there in the right hands viruses can easily bypass these programs as was the case here

7331741 we continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but not limited to the third party website that has allegedly facilitated this illegal exchange of information

7331743 im sensing that we are on the verge of a casual games backlash
7331744 the space is so ridiculously over funded the barriers to entry are so low and the media models require such high traffic to generate meaningful revenue that i think there has to be a shake out i think the sites with traffic like
7331745 i read a recent analyst report that showed almost 90 mmos virtual worlds and online game services scheduled to come to market in the next 18 months
7331746 going to benefit the platform companies weve been seeing tremendous customer growth at
7331747 im increasingly interested in more gamer oriented online games not based on subscription billing models our investment in riot games grew out of this thinking weve seen strong evidence that this combination works in the chinese and korean markets but its been slow to take off here it is going to take the right game to unlock this market but it could be huge
7331748 free to play gaming and virtual worlds monetized through up sold virtual goods and subscriptions are gaining increasing traction in the west
7331749 companies like k2 runescape jagex gameforge eve ccp and bigpoint all doing revenues now in the tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars but gaming like media is not a winner take all business and there are many up and coming companies building free to play experiences and growing fast
7331750 w ith the death of retail and the greater accessibility of games in the hands of an order of magnitude larger audience
7331751 free to play with some premium components becomes the most logical conclusion then of course with alternate billing models comes alternate payment systems
7331752 we are still at the cusp of a sea change in the gaming space that rivals that of web 1 0 in scope
7331753 in part due to the rapid adoption of social networks as an entertainment platform
7331754 social relationships as primary catalysts for game playing were moving back to the playground where games reinforce and create social bonds

7331760 the candidate of change went with the status quo he picked a 35 year veteran of the senate the ultimate insider rather than a candidate from outside washington
7331761 b iden is anything but a change agent having been in office longer than half of all americans have been alive
7331762 the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution
7331763 obama is running on the slogan change we can believe in but the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution senator joe biden of delaware
7331764 obama may decry lobbyist cash or at least federal lobbyist cash but biden has taken 344 400 from lobbyists since 1997 making lobbyists the 10th biggest contributing industry that seems a direct contradiction of the obama message
7331765 at the same time as a 36 year senate veteran biden is a washington insider an image that is at odds with the theme of change obama has promoted
7331766 the decision to go with biden 65 a washington insider over a younger politician with a lesser known national profile such as obamas friend virginia gov tim kaine reflects how tight the contest is between obama and republican john mccain
7331767 obama names sen joe biden as his vice presidential pick
7331768 on the downside biden is a consummate washington insider he was first elected to the senate in 1973 at the age of 29 and plagiarism charges forced him from the 1988 presidential contest
7331769 well the downside is this is a campaign of change who is selecting which is selecting a man whos been in the senate for over three decades there is that
7331770 biden has been in the united states senate for 36 years he was elected in 1972 the year barack obama turned eleven making him for better or worse a quintessential washington insider
7331771 t heres the 2007 abc interview in which biden said he would stand by an earlier statement that obama was not ready to serve as president it seems obama is worried that some voters are starting to agree
7331772 obama all but confessed his lack of knowledge of foreign affairs by selecting as his running mate the senates senior democratic leader on that topic
7331773 no ordinary joe the politics of the veep pick and what he brings to the party
7331774 he wanted someone who could reinforce his message of change but he needed someone with experience
7331775 o bama has spent the last 2 years discounting the experience of folks in the bush administration discounting the experience of hillary clinton and now discounting the experience of john mccain by saying that what matters is judgment not the number of years someone has spent in washington obamas pick belies that notion especially since the core of obamas judgment argument centers on his opposing the iraq war from the beginning joe biden voted for the iraq war
7331776 for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack
7331777 the picks say something profound about obama for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack the biden pick is the next logistical step in an obama campaign that has become more negative a strategic decision that may be necessary but threatens to run counter to his image
7331778 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics in other words obama is willing even eager to risk what got him this far if it gets him to the white house
7331779 its a measure of how badly the last month has gone for the once high flying obama campaign that theyre willing to risk taking on board a shoot from the lip running mate like biden
7331780 mr obamas choice of mr biden suggested some of the weaknesses the obama campaign is trying to address at a time when national polls suggest that his race with senator john mccain the presumptive republican nominee is tightening
7331781 as the associated presss ron fournier noted in an analysis this morning picking biden shows that obama and his team are concerned that questions of whether the illinois senator is ready for the job have the potential to be politically dangerous
7331782 o ne quality that has afflicted biden for as long as anyone can remember a persistent tendency to say silly offensive and off putting things
7331783 the central mystery for those who have watched biden over the years is this how could someone so smart experienced and articulate be his own worst enemy by saying just the wrong thing at just the wrong moment
7331784 bidens good for a good lets call it five gaffes before november 4th if its biden here we go again
7331785 i mean if the obama campaign when they knew this pick was coming they realized bidens good for a good lets call it five gaffes before november 4th they know this they understand this theyre willing to take that risk if its biden here we go again
7331786 the big other problem is that biden has had a tendency to make gaffes on the trail hes not always very disciplined
7331787 he cant keep his mouth shut sometimes he talks before thinking he is not always a systematic thinker he loves to hear himself talk he can get carried away with his enthusiasms
7331788 no ordinary joe the politics of the veep pick and what he brings to the party
7331789 but he can also be a motormouth who veers wildly off message

7331863 i continue to be amazed at how well an event this big comes off i heard the comment over and over that win or lose the experience and meeting so many other people in the buisness is the real prize the ones that walk away unhappy have missed the whole point of the event in my opinion to me i see year after year bands evolving from hobby bands to professional bands and a lot of the evolution comes from networking and learning at this event the big fish from the little ponds learn if they can swim in the big pond
7331864 there is no set time period that we keep the tapes we thought about recording over some of the older ones but because of the quality of the tape we can only use them one time

7331894 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7331895 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7331896 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7331897 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7331898 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected

7331903 its great to see britain coming together like this you hear so much about our broken society but suddenly there is this wonderful sense of patriotism
7331904 things were a lot less showy back then you must remember it was just after the war there were certainly no huge firework displays or any big concerts like this the opening ceremony was quite a small parade but its wonderful to see so many young faces in the crowd getting excited about it imagine the excitement as we get even nearer to the games
7331905 you are the christ the son of the living god
7331906 when i had five loaves and i fed the 5 000 how many baskets of leftovers did you gather up afterward

7331915 one day before the start of the democratic national convention
7331916 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7331917 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7331918 it was agreed pakistan would retain the right to host the event next year but that if at a certain time any members still had reservations then the iccs board would have the right to relocate the event
7331919 india were quite influential in persuading some other nations that that was the right course of action
7331920 cricket is not going to die here in pakistan its just that we are going through a difficult phase
7331921 we would have lost the hosting rights had the champions trophy been relocated to sri lanka
7331922 it made little sense to organize a four team competition
7331923 there are people out there that have information that we still need
7331924 the two that have been arrested may have or not spoken with friends associates about what occurred on that night and wed like to hear from anyone that has information
7331925 we would prefer these persons contact us rather than we go to them
7331926 this doesnt bring john back but it does give the family answers to some questions theyve probably had

7331929 i dont know that we can blame canterbury students for this one we may have to look at otago students this time
7331930 it was much better than last year but im not happy the day was developing well it looked very much like nothing was going to happen
7331931 wa this guy just joied us and he thinks he is so great huh
7331932 its always better to win through collective effort and it shows that we are not relying on any individual
7331933 there are two more matches to go and we will play to win
7331934 i dont think we deserved to win we made too many mistakes with the bat
7331935 we knew we had to negotiate the first 15 overs but we lost four quick wickets and it was an uphill task from there
7331936 once we got the first goal there was only one winner

7331947 nearly 750 000 people are reeling under the impact of the floods
7331948 the river banks are now swamped and we are ready to plug any breach that may occur in the anti flood embankments
7331949 the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states joe biden
7331950 mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom
7331951 and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington dc but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has
7331952 he understands whats going on in this economy he doesnt believe as john mccain does that things are fundamentally sound and weve made great progress when people are losing ground all the time
7331953 i think barack obama did exactly what he said he was going to do he picked someone who complements him
7331954 he picks someone who is of his own mind and will not be a sycophant and picked someone who is knowledgeable in the ways of washington because if barack obama wants to effect change part of doing that is having somebody with you that knows the institutions that you are changing

7331964 we specialize in getting the abuser away from the dog we truly work with the abuser we go to a house if its really cold out we see two dogs in the back we build them a doghouse
7331965 its a big extreme between homicide and a stolen dog
7331966 homicide is an a felony and a stolen dog is larceny but the comparison here is that person cant tell no tales neither can a dog

7331985 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7331986 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7331987 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god

7332018 above the gates of hell is the warning that all that enter should abandon hope less dire but to the same effect is the warning given to those who try to define terrorism
7332019 a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to the most pressing needs of the fatherland
7332020 the term terrorism means premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against non combatant targets by sub national groups or clandestine agents usually intended to influence an audience
7332021 states that support terrorist organizations providing financial aid ideological support military or operational assistance
7332022 states that initiate direct and perform terrorist activities through groups outside their own institutions
7332023 states perpetrating terrorist acts abroad through their own official bodies
7332024 the lack of a political solution and the number of credible reports of massive human rights violations we believe contribute to an environment that is favorable toward terrorism
7332025 i do not deny that i planned sabotage i planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation
7332026 as for their accusations of terrorizing the innocent the children and the women these are in the category of accusing others with their own affliction in order to fool the masses the evidence overwhelmingly shows america and israel killing the weaker men women and children in the muslim world and elsewhere
7332027 god knows it did not cross our minds to attack the towers but after the situation became unbearable and we witnessed the injustice and tyranny of the american israeli alliance against our people in palestine and lebanon i thought about it and the events that affected me directly were that of 1982 and the events that followed when america allowed the israelis to invade lebanon helped by the u s sixth fleet as i watched the destroyed towers in lebanon it occurred to me punish the unjust the same way and to destroy towers in america so it could taste some of what we are tasting and to stop killing our children and women

7332051 but churches and schools have had attacks and its prudent for everyone to seek whatever means that are available
7332052 its one of the oldest and most visible congregations in seattle
7332053 that factors in to how the congregation is viewed and that raises its position in the community
7332054 we are a fairly urban synagogue and i think all major jewish organizations should be looking at their security
7332055 i think its very clear that the shooting at the federation increased everyones concerns about security
7332056 i would never been able to do this by myself
7332057 we are thrilled to have received the homeland security money through the federation
7332058 we have already made some investments and upgrades to our security systems and with the purchase of our building and we will be making even more

7332090 a mentor to young obama as identified in obamas autobiography
7332091 i could not then truthfully deny that this book which came out in 1968 as a greenleaf classic was mine
7332092 in the introduction to sex rebel davis explains that although he has
7332093 im not one to go in for lolitas usually id rather not bed a babe under 20 but there are exceptions i didnt want to disappoint the trusting child at her still impressionistic age a rejection might be traumatic could even cripple her sexually for life
7332094 anne came up many times the next several weeks her aunt thinking she was in good hands actually she was she obtained a course in practical sex from experienced and considerate practitioners rather than from ignorant insensitive neophytes i think we did her a favour although the pleasure was mutual
7332095 i am kind of amazed at some of the things that no one seems to care about when the fdic seized indymac it was a godsend get that crummy lender out of the picture then the fdic announces a radical plan to allow homeowners who borrowed from them to get off the toxic 2 and 28s and teasers and go into fixed rate loans with some forbearance we got that this week no one cared no one
7332096 now right now when we see this we are skeptical when stockpickr decided to give its borrowers more grace the same grace that other banks give we immediately figured it was a canard to mask things but john stumpf the ceo said it seemed like the right thing to do and the bank would do better trying to work things out with lenders than throw them out on their butts instead of course the rate of foreclosures went down and i bet ultimately the number of foreclosures will go lower
7332097 we need time we need time to solve the housing depression the elements of time play out positively because we are a growth nation that cannot have as few built and as few homes bought as in 1991 when we had 248 million people in this country we now have about 310 million people we have more than 60 million more people in this country and we are buying as many homes as we did back then how long can that last
7332098 the answer of course is that given the dramatic overbuilding and the foreclosed homes the oversupply will take months to burn off but not years the trick is to restrict supply which wasnt being done by the homebuilders until
7332099 thats why we need the fdic to own more banks and more banks like wells to work it through and more money from the fha you can see how the system is being overwhelmed by the simple equation of demand vs supply in 2006 for example 7 million homes changed hands slightly more than 2 million were new homes in 2008 we get half the number of new homes being built but we are going to regurgitate 3 5 million homes that foreclosed that gives us 3 5 million more homes on the market than we need
7332100 historically we get about 800 000 new homebuyers naturally in this country because of household formation demographics marriages divorces kids and the like if you believe they all bought new we would still have 3 7 million more homes than we need thats the real issue
7332101 if you really wanted to get granular you can chart out what happens rather easily the default
7332102 when you commit to it and theres people watching you kind of have to stick to it you cant back out you cant fade away and you cant cheat
7332103 if i was doing it alone id probably be off sneaking out of the box in london or grabbing some food

7332109 sei sicuro che non sai oppure non vuoi sapere la risposta alla mia domanda
7332110 ein spiel ist nicht nur dann gut wenn viele tore fallen
7332111 in sterreich m ssen die journalisten aber auch die fans lernen ein spiel richtig zu sehen ein spiel ist nicht nur dann gut wenn viele tore fallen
7332112 aber es ist ein gutes zeichen wenn wir schlecht spielen und gewinnen
7332113 ried war gut und hat die r ume geschickt eng gemacht sie hatten aber sehr viel gl ck
7332114 die mannschaft muss dreckiger spielen ausw rts sind wir zu brav und nur eine gute kundschaft wenn wir uns nicht zu wehren beginnen wird das noch b se enden
7332115 jezek l uft durch unsere leute durch und ich muss feuerwehr spielen wir m ssen mehr verantwortung bernehmen
7332116 uns hat heute eine portion cleverness gefehlt in einem ausw rtsspiel darf man so ein konter tor wie das 2 1 nicht bekommen
7332117 we did a good job of breaking down our first pair but we didnt make good shots and take advantage of it
7332118 later in the day we made some bad moves and bad shots we didnt play up to our ability
7332119 it was pretty tough our there today the lanes had a lower scoring pace and varied from pair to pair
7332120 no one is going to win the tournament today youll have to bowl well on the short pattern tomorrow to get into the top four
7332121 the good news is that we set ourselves up today by not bowling really bad
7332122 the pattern is long so theyre breaking down but your ball wants to hook early
7332123 therefore theres nowhere to go when you move left plus when you cross behind certain teams you dont really know how they bowl or how theyre playing them there isnt a defined spot to play
7332124 fortunately we didnt kill ourselves and grinded it out we feel very confident about tomorrow
7332125 the earth has been measurably cooling for the last decade
7332126 prior to 1991 air power thinking was generally divided in two on the one hand air power was strategic employment of and on the other hand air power was support to army land operations after 1989 the nuclear exchange strategy was no longer valid which only left us the air land battle doctrine to build upon the air land battle doctrine was developed for the european theater as the us doctrine for opposing the warsaw pact offensive army doctrine the doctrine developed for these operations was a tactical level doctrine designed to facilitate a common language for tactical level joint operations between airmen and the army and it is this language upon which we develop todays doctrine
7332127 the foremost limits of a series of areas in which ground combat units are deployed excluding the areas in which the covering or screening forces are operating designated to coordinate fire support the positioning of forces or the maneuver of units
7332128 if you pass the fscl on a deep mission can you still get cas
7332129 single uninterrupted decisive operation by merging the tactical operational and strategic levels of war into a single one in other words the u s was able to fight more rapid decisive continuous operations
7332130 a cog is therefore not a source of strength but a factor of balance
7332131 for connections among the various parts of an adversary or adversaries in order to determine what holds them together
7332132 in planning war operations for it describes that point where the enemy is most vulnerable and the point where an attack will have the best chance of being decisive
7332133 every level of warfare has a center or centers of gravity if several centers of gravity are involved force must be applied to all if the object is to be moved perhaps the most important responsibility of a commander is to identify correctly and strike appropriately enemy centers of gravity in some cases the commander must identify specific reachable centers of gravity if he has neither the resources nor the authorization to act against the ultimate centers in any event theater operations must be planned coordinated and executed with the idea of defeating the enemy by striking decisive blows
7332134 effects based operations ebo are a spin off of network centric warfare ncw hence many of its premises are largely unproven if not outright false ebo and ncw proponents essentially see war as a business
7332135 a deeply flawed systems approach for assessing situations and identifying centers of gravity
7332136 appear to infer causality in a deterministic way without quantifying
7332137 united states joint forces command has been developing this concept for over 5 years and to the same degree as the standing joint force headquarters established in each of theregional combatant commands integration and application vary widely
7332138 joint doctrine bound by a paradigm that limits doctrinal treatment to extant capabilities has introduced the idea of effects and an effects based approach to planning and assessment in mature revision efforts to key publications joint publications 3 0 and 5 0
7332139 though an airman boyd was not an airpower theorist and in fact was little concerned about how to design an air campaign or a strictly air war
7332140 kinetic weapons as defined here are weapons whose effects are transmitted by the motion of a substance such as a projectile a shock wave or heat departing from the conventional definition nonkinetic weapons include
7332141 weve migrated the number of sorties it will take to hit a target to the number of targets that one sortie can strike
7332142 the kamikaze was the deadliest aerial anti shipping threat faced by allied surface warfare forces in the war
7332143 a case in point involved the first non stealthy attack on one target in the basra area shaiba airfield with three aim points
7332144 a mission that integrates offensive and defensive operations to attain and maintain a desired degree of air superiority counterair missions are designed to destroy or negate enemy aircraft and missiles both before and after launch
7332145 with the likely distances to be traversed and the weight and number of weapons to be carried sufficient built in range and endurance will be almost impossible to attain the need for operational air to air refueling aar capability is compelling and must be featured in all planning
7332146 the ability to change roles quickly from oca attack offensive sweep sead and dca even while airborne on a mission can compensate for low numbers of aircraft and represents a key requirement for the pafs force structure
7332147 for offensive sweep operations knowledge of likely enemy rules of engagement roe would be crucial if attrition is to be avoided when positive identification of possible targets is required
7332148 offensive sweeps require suitable air to air weapons in terms of both quality and quantity effective all aspect short range missiles beyond visual range bvr missiles as well as a gun comprise a generally accepted package since air to air engagements can be short and intense the ability to carry an adequate quantity of missiles will be important in such operations for the same reason base stockpiling and resupply must be carefully managed in a prolonged conflict
7332149 an attack to damage or destroy an objective or a capability
7332150 a strong case can be made that the united states should take steps to create a new strategic strike triad relying on its precision and electronic strike capabilities to form two of the three legs with a smaller residual nuclear force comprising the third leg
7332151 cas affects the land battle in the now bai contributes directly to the land battle in the short or near term in the next few hours or maybe as late as the next day
7332152 air action by fixed and rotary wing aircraft against hostile targets that are in close proximity to friendly forces and that require detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces
7332153 in close air support artillery mortar and naval gunfire support fires it is the term included in the method of engagement segment of a call for fire which indicates that friendly forces are within close proximity of the target the close proximity distance is determined by the weapon and munition fired
7332154 land based airpower deployed far forward more often than not surpasses carrier aviation for sheer combat punch and staying power the air force has a long history of identifying building and sustaining such airfields to help the us make the most of all forms of airpower
7332155 can be a great combat multiplier air medevac eases the burden on already scarce evacuation assets and speeds the flow of critically wounded patients to the rear
7332156 m aking all necessary adjustments for the changes in time and place the modern evangelical church eyes fat as grease bastion of born againism is fully as corrupt as the church prior to the reformation
7332157 the flotsam and jetsam at your local jesus junk store is what we find floating on the surface after the shipwreck of reverent worship
7332158 when we understand what is actually happening in a worship service our contemporary flippancy evaporates what happens when a small group of saints gathers in a clapboard community church somewhere out in the sticks at their call to worship they ascend to the city of god to the heavenly jerusalem they walk into the midst of innumerable angels
7332159 therefore with angels and archangels and with all the company of heaven we laud and magnify thy glorious name evermore praising thee and saying holy holy holy lord god of hosts heaven and earth are full of thy glory glory be to thee o lord most high amen
7332160 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart

7332216 first and foremost it has taken the iran nuclear crisis off the front pages of newspapers and headlines of the international media
7332217 it makes the enforcement of already ratified sanctions against tehran more challenging difficult and harder to implement and moreover significantly reduces the chances of consensus among the veto wielding u n security council powers for the imposition of a fourth round of punitive measures against our nation
7332218 even though one hopes the western russian friction proves advantageous for iran it is important to emphasise that snapshot perception of events is often incomplete and at times downright false
7332219 jeopardised the u s strategic objective of exerting pressure on iran
7332220 georgia is not far from irans border and tehran is not happy to see russian or georgian people get killed over territorial disputes so that it could subtly benefit from it in the nuclear dispute with the west
7332221 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7332222 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7332223 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7332224 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7332225 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7332226 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7332227 and dont talk to me about him being an ex marine
7332228 lord that was 40 years ago a lot of stuff can happen in 40 years

7332257 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7332258 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7332259 she had 50 per cent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7332260 shes going to be an important an important voice in this campaign
7332261 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7332262 theyre going to be won over by the clintons appearance this week and what they say
7332263 fay weakens to a depression but heavy rains and flooding could continue for several days
7332264 a flash flood watch is in effect through monday evening for much of south eastern louisiana
7332265 we have activated our teams as a precautionary measure for the safety of the public
7332266 we are ready to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7332267 but fay could become nearly stationary or stall on monday over eastern louisiana and southern mississippi
7332268 fay weakens to a depression but heavy rains and flooding could continue for several days

7332273 you dont like it when somebody is rewarded for an accident of birth over which they had no control people that look like me receive far more benefits far more often than this
7332274 what they want how they want it when they want it
7332275 typically this race is always a break not everyone is motivated to race with the big day tomorrow
7332276 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
7332277 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
7332278 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
7332279 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
7332280 its creating a political climate where immigrants are seen as a net benefit to the state
7332281 the states highest officeholder is sending a message that his state welcomes immigrants
7332282 were it not for immigrants and refugees massachusetts would have seen a population decline in the last seven years
7332283 immigrants are becoming increasingly important to the health of the state economy
7332284 its in the best interest of the state communities and immigrant families to expedite their integration
7332285 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7332286 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7332287 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7332288 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7332289 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7332290 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7332291 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7332292 being a good steward of the resources we were given
7332293 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7332294 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7332295 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7332296 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7332297 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7332298 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7332299 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7332300 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7332301 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7332302 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7332303 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7332304 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7332305 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7332306 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7332307 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7332308 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7332309 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7332310 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7332311 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7332312 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7332313 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7332314 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7332315 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7332316 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7332317 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7332318 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7332319 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7332320 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7332321 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7332322 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7332323 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7332324 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7332325 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7332326 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7332327 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7332328 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7332329 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7332330 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7332331 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7332332 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7332333 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7332334 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7332335 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7332336 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7332337 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7332338 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7332339 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7332344 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7332345 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7332346 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7332347 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7332348 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7332349 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7332350 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7332351 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7332352 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7332353 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7332354 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7332355 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7332356 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7332357 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7332358 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7332361 i still think a one term pledge could win it for him mccain because it would allow america to punt it would make the 2008 choice seem less fateful people dont mind the chance to defer a choice when theyre not at all sure about the product
7332362 well brian i think looking back there is something to be said for the idea that i will be a better president now than frankly i would have been four years ago
7332363 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7332364 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7332365 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7332366 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7332367 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7332401 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7332402 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7332403 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7332404 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area

7332408 it looked like he was shot out of a cannon
7332409 rahsaan came up to me and asked do you want to win
7332410 so i jumped on his wheel and kayle followed when i felt him slowing down coming into the second to last corner i punched out and went for it
7332411 i had confidence i could hold my speed and hit out
7332412 i also knew kayle was right there and could win if i didnt
7332413 the win tonight was good for the morale but were staying hungry
7332414 this was by no means our goal winning the national title is our no 1 goal
7332415 there is definitely some significance to it perhaps we wont see it now but in the future it will carry some weight
7332416 i dont think theres another team in the world that would allow and promote and support these individuals to the level that they have attained
7332417 whether it be rahsaan bahati justin williams oscar sevilla tyler hamilton or kayle leogrande if it wasnt for the program we put together collectively they could not have had these results it is really really special
7332418 it was a huge relief to come across the line with my arms up
7332419 candelario hekman and i came into the last turn nascar style pretty much stacked three wide with me in the middle but once we got into the straightaway and i got the gear going i knew i had it

7332421 theres not a race in the world that he cant win and i believe that whole heartedly
7332422 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
7332423 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
7332424 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
7332425 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

7332436 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else

7332440 there were some key performances obviously vincents come in for us and looked every bit the player that i thought he was beforehand
7332441 its always a worry just throwing players in at the deep end and hes only had one training session with the group
7332442 but i think everybody today saw what an accomplished football player he is and what an asset hes going to be for us
7332443 i just loved it i enjoyed it 100 lots of duels lots of energy
7332444 i loved it in midfield but a job had to be done in defence

7332450 israeli forces invaded hebron late on wednesday morning and forced their way into the offices of
7332451 we will see who wants to be part of this and then we will get a manager that everybody will be happy with
7332452 and i know alex ferguson has been approached by seb coe and i have spoken to him about it
7332453 i think the whole of the country will want when the olympic games is held in britain and theres a football tournament where the final is held in britain they will want us to have a team in the competition
7332454 im not sure they the different national associations would allow it
7332455 countries have their own identity their own patriotism it has been mooted for a number of years by fifa at the world cup that great britain has a team it would be impractical in that sense scotland northern ireland wales even england all have their own identities so i dont think it is a starter
7332456 i hope im still on this planet in 2012 first of all i dont need any commitment to anything like that
7332457 this is an extraordinary blunder by the prime minister particularly leading up to the by election in glenrothes
7332458 what does he think the people of fife would think about putting at risk the future of the scottish football team
7332459 the fact is that gordon brown has become so obsessed with his british campaign he has lost touch with reality
7332460 this is not a popular idea not only do all the national supporters associations oppose this but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team
7332461 gordon brown has scored an own goal of spectacular proportions by promoting this daft idea on the eve of a vital scottish by election
7332462 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7332463 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7332464 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7332465 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7332466 jag hann aldrig ifatt efter min skada tidigare i sommar
7332467 die nachfrage f r die aua ist noch gr er als erwartet
7332468 men i verkligheten r det bara f rlorarna som st lls till svars
7332469 ja die meneer daar met dat zwarte jasje en die groene flodderbroek
7332470 ja u wilt u rechtsomkeert maken en even gezellig met ons mee doen
7332471 nee het is niet vanwege mijn religie dat ik een borrel afsla ik heb een nierziekte
7332472 does a runner at your level ever feel like youd rather not run today like you dont want to run and would rather just sleep in
7332473 there is considerable uncertainty about defining the difference between lakes and ponds
7332474 further in common usage many lakes bear names ending with the word
7332475 in ecology the environment of a lake is referred to as lacustrine
7332476 we have to be certain that what we tell the families is the truth
7332477 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7332478 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7332479 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7332480 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7332481 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7332482 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7332483 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7332484 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7332485 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7332486 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7332487 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7332488 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7332489 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7332490 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7332491 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7332492 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7332493 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7332494 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7332495 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7332496 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7332497 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7332498 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7332499 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7332500 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7332501 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7332502 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7332503 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7332504 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7332505 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7332506 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7332507 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7332508 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7332509 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7332510 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7332511 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7332512 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7332513 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7332514 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7332515 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7332516 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7332517 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7332518 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7332519 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7332520 good things come to those who wait or cant wait
7332521 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7332522 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7332523 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7332524 i was doubtful about my future but when speaking with guardiola he told me he believed in me and felt i could help the team a lot
7332525 i only wanted to stay if the manager believed in me and if i could bring something to the team
7332526 there are a lot of midfielders in the team but they all have different qualities guardiola has asked me to come from deep and score goals
7332527 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7332528 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7332529 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7332530 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7332531 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7332532 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7332533 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7332534 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7332535 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7332536 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7332537 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7332538 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7332539 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7332540 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7332541 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7332542 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7332569 this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7332570 this is the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
7332571 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7332572 we are very confident but i can not give you a percentage but virtually all of it has been removed
7332573 there have been outbreaks like this before we are getting better at what we do
7332574 my understanding is there were 96 sandwiches produced and 23 sandwiches are outstanding which i think speaks to the level of detail that everybody is going to to get the product back
7332575 its not in direct response to that but weve seen much increased activity in terms of russian overflights of canadian airspace the americans are seeing the same thing around alaska
7332576 so thats one element but its not the only element its something that is now starting to give us some cause for serious concern
7332577 what many thought was a somewhat silly flag planting incident in canadas arctic

7332624 wir wollen nicht dass es so weitergeht dass alle vier stunden eine neue moschee in italien errichtet wird fr her hatten wir mit den moslems zu tun jetzt mit dem islam das hei t mit einer gesellschaft die nicht zwischen politik religion und kultur unterscheidet und unvereinbar mit unserem juristischen system ist die imams sind bischof b rgermeister und schulleiter in einer person
7332625 grundfalsch daf r gibt es die musalla beliebige orte die man daf r benutzt die moscheen sind ein politisches symbolisches und sehr oft auch milit risches zentrum der islam lebt seit jahrhunderten im widerspruch zum westen und befindet sich mit diesem im kriegszustand

7332653 this hardell et al study showed that the chance of developing a malignant brain tumor was roughly eight times higher for cell phone users in the swedish countryside than in urban areas the risk of developing any brain tumour was four times higher for country dwellers using mobile phones for five years or more compared with those who did not use the devices
7332654 the authors found 11 studies on people who had used mobile phones for more than a decade some of these showed that mobile phone use significantly increased the risk of some types of brain cancer while others did not
7332655 researchers found that long term users had double the chance of getting a malignant tumour on the side of the brain where they held the handset

7332661 yeah man i must fall in love with like at least thirty girls a day
7332662 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7332663 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7332664 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7332665 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7332666 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7332667 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7332668 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together

7332670 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7332671 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7332672 inside the stadiums things have gone very very well reporters seem very pleased with the number of press conferences that were held and the degree of access they had to officials however outside the stadiums we have confirmed more than 30 cases of reporting interference heard of another 20
7332673 there is a fact that there were 77 applications thats what we have been told we found it unusual that none of these applications have come through with protest
7332674 well thats one nest that wont be happening this year
7332675 estoy muy orgulloso de estos jugadores se me puso la piel de gallina de ver lo que hicieron
7332676 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7332677 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7332678 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7332679 the defendant and the others shoved the complainant dropped her to the floor beat her slammed her head against the floor and kicked her all over her body
7332680 the defendant or one of the others sat on her head in a bid to prevent her from seeing what was going on and to prevent her from resisting
7332681 a man who is allegedly willing to take part in the cruel beating of a young and helpless woman suspected of socializing with married men and all this solely for money is a dangerous conscienceless person with no inhibitions

7332688 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal
7332689 most of the super thin girls who flaunt their supposed curves did not come by them naturally
7332690 i saw a picture of myself and was horrified at the way i look
7332691 its awesome im busy can always be busier but im lucky to be as busy as i am now i wrestle pretty much every weekend and thats all i can ask for
7332692 everybodys opinion is just something that motivated me to try and up my game in every aspect if people thought i was missing that one thing obviously there was something that wasnt connecting me to everybody which is the point in this business is to connect with everybody no matter who they are
7332693 right now things are going good theres a decent amount of young guys that are looking to work hard and earn their stripes and take the next step to become a better performer and a better pro wrestler so i think right now all the companies are doing sort of what they need to do to work together and help and keep everyone busy because thats the only way you can really learn in this business is to wrestle as much as you possibly can in front of different people and different crowds
7332694 there are a handful of groups that are doing right for this business in florida im pretty impressed with it actually
7332695 just having the opportunity to do the things ive done in ring of honor thats the first major test if i can stay there as long as i possibly can and make it there i can see no reason why i couldnt go anywhere else and stay for just as long
7332696 sometimes when that camera gets in your face i just lock up im not going to deny it its truthful and sometimes things dont come off the way i really feel about them its like anything anybody does like an actor tom cruise wasnt tom cruise right off the bat its all a matter of just finding your niche and finding out whats comfortable to you and what can put you into that character the easies thats the only way that you do get better
7332697 when you work with people you teach them the things you know and i try not to teach anything outside of my boundaries because obviously i dont know it if i dont have an understanding of it i wont try to teach somebody that it brings you back to your first day your second day so as you teach the people you kind of go through those steps again and you catch a lot of your flaws that you were making and didnt realize you were making because you havent been critiqued specifically as you are critiquing this person
7332698 it was a great opportunity when i was there and my face was on tv a lot in my four or five months that i was actually going on tv so i appreciated the opportunity there
7332699 me and austin aries got suspended we were asked to leave a ring of honor show early and miss it and fly into orlando for the pay per view we let them know that we would be making it to the pay per view but we had to fulfill our commitment to ring of honor as well we ended up making it to the pay per view just late and they suspended us because of that it was their decision and it was right in their book so im not going to argue with them about that
7332700 its just something in this business if you say you are going to be there you want to be there no matter what thats the way that people can believe in you and trust you in a business where trust is very important
7332701 who do you want to answer the phone at 3 a m
7332702 as long as clinton was a viable candidate in the democratic nomination process many of our members felt a passionate need to return the loyalty she has earned over decades of support
7332703 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
7332704 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
7332705 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music
7332706 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control

7332711 het is een duurbetaalde bezigheid die zichzelf goed verkoopt onder het voorwendsel van wetenschappelijkheid
7332712 er is een verschil tussen wat de ge nterviewde zegt en wat de interviewer noteert
7332713 its an interesting move for google to leverage the adsense network beyond pure advertising
7332714 its an interesting video monetisation as well with ads being drawn from the normal adsense pool
7332715 we invest so much of our lives to this pursuit to have it pay dividends in amazing of course ive tried to compartmentalize so much of my emotions the last couple of weeks so finally the filters kind of came down
7332716 we cant bring todd back and we cant erase what happened but i can enjoy this and i can mourn and deal with both of those emotions
7332717 this is something weve all invested our lives in and to come out to hear our anthem being played thats something you think about when youre 12 years old you want to hear your anthem with you on the gold medal stand i cant even tell you how that feels
7332718 and that was a function of a lot of things but i think more than any thing it was about this team finding its own culture and its own identity and trying to remove itself from the pretty big shadow cast by the teams in the 80s and their behaviors and how they went about doing it they had to figure out their own way on how to win and obviously we did that
7332719 like we hang out we love to compete were always competing whether its cards or ping pong or whatever and i think thats whats brought us this entire journey that type of togetherness
7332720 a fivb official asked me how i thought these olympics were going to turn out for us
7332721 and i said were going to win the gold medal
7332722 you just have to there are so many other lives invested in this process than just my own and so when i had to take some time i off i knew it wasnt helping the team and when i came back i knew i had to be 100 percent invested in what were doing and be fully present
7332723 and after that it was just a couple of heavyweights dooking it out
7332724 i think they thought they had the fourth set won pretty easily but we hung in there
7332725 and once we started tasting blood it was hard to contain ourselves
7332726 there was nothing left to say we just kind of sat there and listened to each other smile
7332727 conducting a pre planned routine visit to the black sea region to interact and exercise with our nato partners romania and bulgaria which is an important feature of our routine planning
7332728 the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economies of neighbouring countries
7332729 we started this right before the iraqi study group came out
7332730 things were really bad at that time and we just felt like the lord wanted us to pray
7332731 but there are other less sentimental reasons why the catholic hierarchy dreads a split

7332733 who is going to meet the legal liabilities and the costs of this
7332734 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7332735 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7332736 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous
7332737 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
7332738 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7332739 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
7332740 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations
7332741 thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
7332742 new fields arent coming on line fast enough to replace cantarell
7332743 if i am at dinner with a friend i keep glancing at my watch how soon can i leave how long till i am back in my apartment if i am in my apartment i am anxious i should go out i need to be out i need to go somewhere if i am downtown i worry about the subway on the way home will it come will i be safe i go to the theater with friends i want to leave at intermission i cant concentrate i am worried about how i am going to get home this anxiety anxiety about nothing no reason or sense to it flows in and out of my mind all day
7332744 then he stops was that good for you he says it was good for me he adds i laugh this was not a nervous laugh are you laughing at me he said i am i said and that was that
7332745 i thought i would spend every saturday of my life at the zoo
7332746 but that phase passed and other phases passed and now i am looking at the hours of the day as if they were endless dunes in an endless desert there is nothing to do but start forward
7332747 and most likely will never have another but i will be fine i will be sad often but not always

7332750 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7332751 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7332752 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7332753 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7332754 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7332755 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7332756 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7332757 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7332758 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7332759 if jesus had been killed twenty years ago catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses
7332760 they call lenny bruce a sick comic and sick he is sick of all the pretentious phoniness of a generation that makes his vicious humor meaningful he is a rebel but not without a cause for there are shirts that need un stuffing egos that need deflating
7332761 one last four letter word for lenny dead at forty thats obscene
7332762 im here firstly for the experience and i will certainly get that if i play regularly in matches like this and travel with the team
7332763 it is what i need really i couldnt get that much at arsenal so i am happy to be here and happy to know im going to get more games than at arsenal
7332764 i dont remember too much about that game except old trafford but i know it was tough that day they were a lot stronger
7332765 i had sunderland manchester city newcastle stoke hull and west ham all interested in me its great to know that interest was there
7332766 there were some key performances obviously vincents come in for us and looked every bit the player that i thought he was beforehand
7332767 its always a worry just throwing players in at the deep end and hes only had one training session with the group
7332768 but i think everybody today saw what an accomplished football player he is and what an asset hes going to be for us
7332769 i just loved it i enjoyed it 100 lots of duels lots of energy
7332770 i loved it in midfield but a job had to be done in defence
7332771 i was doubtful about my future but when speaking with guardiola he told me he believed in me and felt i could help the team a lot
7332772 i only wanted to stay if the manager believed in me and if i could bring something to the team
7332773 there are a lot of midfielders in the team but they all have different qualities guardiola has asked me to come from deep and score goals

7332787 una miniserie de cuatro noches de duraci n con una audiencia potencial de m s de 20 millones de personas
7332788 existen dos imperativos estrat gicos prioritarios en la convenci n
7332789 uno es hacer que la gente se ponga c moda con barack obama el otro es definir la carrera electoral con claridad estableciendo a obama como un factor de cambio y a mccain como continuaci n de las pol ticas de bush tanto a nivel nacional como en el extranjero
7332790 se trata de aclarar la idea de que las elecciones se realizar n entre dos candidatos y dos partidos pol ticos
7332791 no veo la alegr a que suele darse tras unas primarias
7332792 obama es un tipo que quiere unir al mundo pero que ha dividido al partido dem crata como nunca se hab a visto desde la guerra de vietnam
7332793 siempre estamos buscando oportunidades para poner a nuestra gente manos a la obra en lugar de sentarles c modamente y ponerles a escuchar discursos
7332794 juste quelquun de bien quelquun qui on tient quelquun de bien
7332795 misschien had je gewoon kunnen zeggen wat er op je hart lag
7332796 je kop in het zand steken en gewoon gaan lopen helpt niet en lost dingen niet op ze negeren doet dat ook niet
7332797 the impossible we do right away but miracles take a little longer
7332798 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7332799 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7332800 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7332801 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7332802 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
7332803 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7332804 people who know me know that im not a shrinking violet
7332805 i didnt sign up to be the guy who plays the harlem globetrotters
7332806 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
7332807 being on fox is like going into the second room
7332808 when the wind kicks up get the hell off the lake
7332809 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7332810 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7332811 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7332812 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7332813 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7332814 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7332815 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7332816 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7332817 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7332818 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7332819 we deplore those who are led astray those jehovahs witnesses baptists evangelicals pentecostals and many others who cut christs robes like bandits who are like the soldiers who crucified christ who ripped apart christs holy coat
7332820 even if such censorship were a violation of first amendment rights
7332821 everyone knows there is a line sometimes that can be crossed when it comes to free speech and when free speech transforms into hate speech weve got to draw that line
7332822 what if all the leading anti immigration groups were founded by the same man funded by the same organization and have ties to white supremacy
7332823 to present a moderate face that is disconnected from the extremists but in reality isnt

7332827 they have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it
7332828 so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7332829 once again the enemies of islam have stained their hands with the blood of innocent people we the muslim nation will not accept their apologies this time
7332830 we regret the loss of life among the innocent afghans who we are committed to protect
7332831 the concern is that the government and international community will lose the credibility of the afghan people

7332846 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7332847 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7332848 she had 50 per cent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7332849 shes going to be an important an important voice in this campaign
7332850 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time

7332910 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7332911 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7332912 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable

7332932 the imaginary time bomb why an ageing population is not a social problem
7332933 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs

7333022 there was an assumption that if you were a major donor and wanted to be an ambassador go to state dinners with the queen unless you were an outright fool you were going to go with hillary whether you liked her or not
7333023 my staff prided themselves on discretion loyalty and camaraderie and we had our own special ethos
7333024 while the west wing had a tendency to leak hillaryland never did
7333025 what patti has that is real power is the unquestioned trust and confidence of the candidate
7333026 o nosso primeiro e ultimo amor o amor pr prio
7333027 he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships
7333028 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7333029 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7333030 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7333031 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7333032 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7333033 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7333034 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7333035 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7333036 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7333037 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7333038 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7333039 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7333040 you cant compare new york which has buildings all around to denver that has open areas
7333041 we would be remiss if we didnt prepare for mass arrests
7333042 people would sit in buses waiting hours days to be processed if we didnt have this set up
7333043 we have a pamphlet called the constitution a lot of us have read it already
7333044 changing the law to transform innocent behavior into a crime where it poses no threat to public safety is entirely uncalled for and inconsistent with principles of the first amendment
7333045 it has a chilling effect on free speech and that has been found time and time again to be improper under first amendment principles
7333046 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7333047 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7333048 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7333049 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7333050 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7333051 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq news and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7333052 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7333053 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7333054 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him

7333058 das landtagspr sidium hat in meiner anwesenheit zwar gestern best tigt dass es mein gutes recht als landtagsabgeordneter ist expertenhearings im landtag zu organisieren und dazu auch ffentlich einzuladen allerdings so das landtagspr sidium k nne das von mir geplante hartz iv hearing zwar an jedem anderen tag aber nicht am 12 september im landtag stattfinden die begr ndung dass in der ffentlichkeit der eindruck entstanden sei dass es sich dabei um eine parteiveranstaltung handele ist fragw rdig und fadenscheinig denn aus der einladung geht klar hervor dass ich als abgeordneter die veranstaltung organisiere und durchf hre und nicht die partei denn ich kenne die regel des hohen hauses und die gesetzeslage es ist ein einmaliger vorgang dass das landtagspr sidium aufgrund einer meldung einer nachrichtenagentur einem landtagsabgeordneten die genehmigung zur durchf hrung einer veranstaltung verweigert dies obwohl ich mich sachlich v llig richtig verhalten habe es entsteht der eindruck dass meine politische arbeit als abgeordneter im landtag und mitglied der partei die linke nrw behindert werden soll und man will wohl nicht massenhaft hartz empf ngerinnen auf meine einladung im landtag haben
7333059 das hearing ist durch hervorragende expertinnen prominent und sachkundig besetzt inzwischen haben harald thom und frank j ger tacheles e v wuppertal die professorinnen helga spindler universit t duisburg essen und rainer roth fh frankfurt andreas schmidt dgb bezirk nrw und martin behrsing erwerbslosen forum deutschland bonn sowie die bundestagsabgeordnete inge h ger die linke ihre teilnahme zugesagt mittlerweile liegen schon weit ber 100 anmeldungen aus nrw vor darunter viele von hartz iv betroffenen und da die veranstaltung jetzt nicht im landtag stattfinden kann werden es wohl noch viele mehr werden
7333060 you are not allowed to talk with each other yet
7333061 mentally it was about the hardest thing i had to go through i still hoped for a miracle that i would line up and feel like i had before but

7333064 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
7333065 there were some key performances obviously vincents come in for us and looked every bit the player that i thought he was beforehand
7333066 its always a worry just throwing players in at the deep end and hes only had one training session with the group
7333067 but i think everybody today saw what an accomplished football player he is and what an asset hes going to be for us
7333068 i just loved it i enjoyed it 100 lots of duels lots of energy
7333069 i loved it in midfield but a job had to be done in defence
7333070 yes we are looking at him but there is no deal yet
7333071 my general manager is out there at the moment having a look he played yesterday
7333072 it is a possibility and there might be something happening but i am very very pleased with what we have got and what we have done
7333073 i would love here genuinely to buy british and young british like i did with lee cattermole
7333074 then you wouldnt have the problem of them flying to honduras and mexico city on international duty when they are away for days people say that you should know that when you sign them but i have no choice
7333075 i didnt like to have to go to cairo to get egypt international striker amr zaki but when you see him play you can see it was worth it
7333076 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
7333077 im here firstly for the experience and i will certainly get that if i play regularly in matches like this and travel with the team
7333078 it is what i need really i couldnt get that much at arsenal so i am happy to be here and happy to know im going to get more games than at arsenal
7333079 i dont remember too much about that game except old trafford but i know it was tough that day they were a lot stronger
7333080 i had sunderland manchester city newcastle stoke hull and west ham all interested in me its great to know that interest was there
7333081 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
7333082 i was doubtful about my future but when speaking with guardiola he told me he believed in me and felt i could help the team a lot
7333083 i only wanted to stay if the manager believed in me and if i could bring something to the team
7333084 there are a lot of midfielders in the team but they all have different qualities guardiola has asked me to come from deep and score goals
7333085 such obvious contradictory assumptions show yudkowskys preference for drama over reason
7333086 you should not assume such a poor implementation of my idea that it cannot make discriminations that are trivial to current humans
7333087 photo 1 positive photo 2 negative photo 3 negative photo 4 positive
7333088 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7333089 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7333090 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7333091 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared
7333092 however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7333093 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7333094 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7333095 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7333096 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7333097 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7333098 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7333099 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7333100 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7333101 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 per cent for him
7333102 resist a two party system that allows imperialism and racism to continue unrestrained
7333103 libs i like the busdriver that i met the other night i still have faith and patience even though they both get strained occasionally when i get called a liberal
7333104 liberal and conservative had a baby and they named him rainbowhed
7333105 hey there are scumbags on both sides of the aisle

7333107 when my second posting there for the new york times ended with imprisonment and deportation on charges of using a motorcycle trip across the chinese heartland as a cover for spying on the countrys missile program
7333108 this is what they understood or they wanted to understand
7333109 were wearing aprons but everybody whos here the agents the editors the faculty the fellows the other contributors knows that this person whos waiting on you is going to be a very important writer in four or five years
7333110 so for us its kind of amazing and i think for everybody its kind of amazing
7333111 its humbling we handle compost things spill theres a lot of running
7333112 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation
7333113 but you have to go up to them and ask do you want chicken or the vegetarian option and when you start talking to them that way when youre getting them their coffee and their dessert a natural sort of conversation starts happening
7333114 i took a lot of naps and a lot of advil
7333115 its like having tiger woods help you with your putting
7333116 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7333117 write these words for according to the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with you and with israel
7333118 i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last
7333119 what you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in asia to ephesus to smyrna to pergamos to thyatira to sardis to philadelphia and to laodicea
7333120 thus speaks the lord god of israel saying write in a book for yourself all the words that i have spoken to you
7333121 cut two tablets of stone like the first ones and i will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke
7333122 write these words for according to the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with you and with israel
7333123 i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last
7333124 what you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in asia to ephesus to smyrna to pergamos to thyatira to sardis to philadelphia and to laodicea
7333125 thus speaks the lord god of israel saying write in a book for yourself all the words that i have spoken to you
7333126 cut two tablets of stone like the first ones and i will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke
7333127 ela parece estar nos seus 30 anos esta a turn mais agitada dos ltimos tempos principalmente like a prayer
7333128 ela ainda consegue balan ar como se fosse uma garota de 20 anos de idade
7333129 ela n o fez nada das coisas tradicionais pelas quais ela t o amada
7333130 por 85 libras r 255 o ingresso eu fiquei muito decepcionada
7333131 its a surprise her daughter is turning 18 youd think she could have planned ahead
7333132 it wont be good for me or my neighbors or the bank or merced if i lose it yet thats where im headed its very frustrating
7333133 could have figured out that too much inventory and not enough bodies was a recipe for disaster
7333134 in four or five years when their credit is better and the market has recovered ill sell the house back to them
7333135 ill try my best to pay my mortgage but if not ill have no choice to leave like the other people
7333136 its her luck why would i be mad at her
7333137 there were supposed to be stores and a fire station over there
7333138 we could all march down to city hall and picket but whats really going to happen with that
7333139 i would never deny we all got greedy everyone was setting records nobody was there to take away the punch bowl
7333140 they swore they were going to live in the houses
7333141 property is unacceptable due to high foreclosure rate and volatility of subject market
7333142 if a few institutions take the position that prices in the central valley are still excessive and they need to wait to finance houses there youll have the total collapse of the market
7333143 we have to stop thinking that more growth is always the answer
7333144 we have more housing than we need we need jobs
7333145 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7333146 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7333147 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7333148 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7333149 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7333150 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7333151 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7333152 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7333153 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7333154 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7333155 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7333156 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7333157 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7333158 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7333159 they havent called but if they need me im on a plane whatever they want
7333160 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7333161 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7333162 fay weakens to a depression but heavy rains and flooding could continue for several days
7333163 a flash flood watch is in effect through monday evening for much of south eastern louisiana
7333164 we have activated our teams as a precautionary measure for the safety of the public
7333165 we are ready to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7333166 but fay could become nearly stationary or stall on monday over eastern louisiana and southern mississippi
7333167 fay weakens to a depression but heavy rains and flooding could continue for several days
7333168 the only people who have access to the police caption of summary are myself the officer in charge of the case the crown and mr veitch and his team
7333169 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7333170 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7333171 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7333172 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7333173 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
7333174 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7333175 people who know me know that im not a shrinking violet
7333176 i didnt sign up to be the guy who plays the harlem globetrotters
7333177 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
7333178 being on fox is like going into the second room
7333179 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7333180 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7333181 6 to 7 inches south of the tennessee river and 3 to 4 inches north of the river
7333182 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7333183 there was a great rush to build the local section of the canal but suddenly in the spring it stopped
7333184 how can we grow rice we dont even have enough water for corn
7333185 before we dug a well two metres deep and got water now we dig 10 metres deep and get nothing
7333186 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7333187 if low cost carriers have the capital to survive high fuel prices they will find considerable new opportunities in the u s legacy carriers are not only increasing fares but also adding a lot of fees there is a bigger cost differential between southwest and legacy carriers than there has been in a long time
7333188 personal adjustment problems showing up in all kinds of places it was fairly clear that we were going to be seeing more of those things
7333189 were busier than ever and we havent had any recent publicity or visibility
7333190 and we havent seen the full bore of the housing crisis
7333191 you can really see how full your schedule is getting
7333192 financial stress job layoffs housing problems transportation all of which can complicate and heighten an already existing diagnosis of depression or anxiety
7333193 the standard percentage paid by the insurance company used to be 80 20
7333194 whose family is under such financial stress that she cant come anymore which is horrible ill reduce my fee but its the gas to get here theyre going down to one car and they cant spare the car
7333195 families where the main breadwinner is in the mortgage and housing industry are just being killed by this therapy is a luxury for every family
7333196 its harder to pick up the phone especially for those who have never been seen in the mental health system theres still a stigma add economic barriers and that takes it to another level entirely
7333197 definitely seeing more prospects coming in specifically looking for additional help
7333198 if im laid off how do i manage my money for a few months
7333199 someone who could come alongside them and give them guidance and emotional confidence
7333200 i try to help clients focus on what they have control over

7333247 if youre part of the team when we launch you deserve to be in the credits no question about it that in my estimation is what the credits are for
7333248 everyone who is currently at mythic whos worked on warhammer is going to be in the credits and thats good enough for me
7333249 online games are ever changing and have ever changing credits
7333250 if we set that precedent right now that anyone who worked on the game at any point in time is going to be in the credits the credits will be 20 pages long within a couple of years and nobody does that

7333355 deaf people may no longer need interpreters to be present for doctors appointments and other meetings thanks to a technology which will enable them to communicate via a remote translator
7333356 this is going to affect all aspects of every day conversation for deaf people from making a housing application to inquiring about a school discussing their health with a gp or talking about tax with their account

7333360 with it being 12 feet wide which is extremely wide for its size it allows us to deliver and set boat lifts with a two man crew as opposed to the old method a slow moving boat that needed four people to jockey and set the lift in place
7333361 weve been very impressed with the performance of the boat its common to travel fifteen miles over water to get to a job site most work boats are semi displacement vessels that plow through the water at a slow pace the chinook pontoon work boats incorporate an angular flat pontoon design that has a higher displacement and better surface planning capability the design provides better hydro dynamics to allow the vessel to plane on the waters surface where it can move quickly and more efficiently we specifically wanted this boat so it would save money in labor costs by getting people to the job faster weve had a lot of competitors some who come from five hundred miles away looking at the boat for design ideas for their operations
7333362 in the summer we throw a crew party for our twenty five employees we turn the pontoon into a floating party barge we decorate it and cruise all over the lake waving at everybody weve had more than 30 people on that boat

7333376 i am already looking forward to my duties this year traveling meeting new people and getting the word out about my platform which is cancer early detection
7333377 theres not another one like this in the world there just aint
7333378 theres a very good possibility the boat will go to scrap this year and if not it will for sure go to scrap in may of 2009
7333379 freighters will come into the river and fill the e m ford up with powdered cement and as the lafarge plant needs cement in its silos ill fire up the fords big diesel generator and that powers up the boats unloading equipment
7333380 as the silos get low i fill them up with the cement
7333381 i was on this boat when i was 5 years old and this was my dads first captains job i used to spend half my summers on this thing with my dad
7333382 it has a 1 500 hsp quadruple expansion steam engine thats what all of the boat nerds are going to remember about it
7333383 for it to be built in 1898 and to have that much horsepower was impressive that allowed it to have speeds of 13 mph
7333384 when it was put into service it had to share the shipping lanes with wooden sailing ships hauling cargoes of all types
7333385 james davidson built the largest wooden ships on the lakes in that era in west bay city and his biggest one was slightly more than 300 feet long the e m ford wasnt the first steel hulled freighter but it was 428 feet long
7333386 this thing was like a monster going by and it turned heads
7333387 the kids would leave the boat and walk by with their backpacks on their way to school
7333388 none of those ships are historically as significant as the e m ford which has the only quadruple expansion steam engine left other than one that might be at the bottom of a lake someplace
7333389 weve researched with all the major museums including the smithsonian institution and there is no historical society out there in north america that we could possibly donate the ship to
7333390 we work but we dont get enough money through our jobs and we dont get any health insurance benefits
7333391 i just hope that the bay health plan continues because otherwise wed be going without medical care
7333392 the people who need health insurance should be getting it
7333393 i just think there should be some kind of low cost health care somewhere that people can afford until they get on their feet
7333394 the program has been here for eight years and we havent needed until now to ask for any other support but the need is so great
7333395 the people that stand to gain are all of the county residents in some way or another we all know someone who is uninsured
7333396 this is a pain in my side and im getting into many heated arguments about it
7333397 i just had an increase in my insurance and why should i pay for your insurance i feel bad for people but its not my responsibility
7333398 but i dont think we can stand another tax from the county right now
7333399 we dont need all the riffraff from other areas coming into bay city
7333400 emergency room use by the uninsured has decreased by almost 50 percent preventative services like mammograms have almost quadrupled and tests like psa screenings for prostate cancer have more than doubled
7333401 affordable basic health care coverage for working adults who cant get insurance from their employer and dont qualify for medicaid or other state programs
7333402 people at times do lose their jobs and we do help people who have lost jobs until they are able to get back into a position that has health coverage
7333403 but the fact is that 90 percent of our plan b members are working
7333404 the tax dollars are for bay county residents and they stay in bay county
7333405 bay county has a very high rate of respiratory disease heart disease and diabetes just in the general population
7333406 our feeling is that agricultural lands need to be exempt from all these special taxes
7333407 it does provide some care to people its just that its not the most efficient way to deliver health care in this country
7333408 because im a small business owner i know the game
7333409 these improvements mark continued progress toward eliminating threats to our waters and the health of our families from the discharge of untreated sewage
7333410 we must continue to make the necessary financial and resource investments in michigans future until all untreated sewer overflows are eliminated
7333411 its still a considerable amount that they discharged into public waters
7333412 add to that soup that unfortunately causes the algae growth and death that results in the fairly nasty muck that occurs on the beaches

7333434 today were learning our tap water is not as clean as it could be lead by products from chlorine which have been linked to an increased risk of cancer and many other pollutants are showing up in our tap water
7333435 we were curious as to whether it would make a difference
7333436 we saw no other cause for the water use to drop
7333437 there have been more studies conducted on waterless urinals than perhaps any other plumbing fixture or product

7333440 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7333441 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7333442 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7333443 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7333444 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7333445 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7333446 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7333447 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7333453 well well well look whos back home my favorite student glod the gnome good to see you please come in what brings you back to school again
7333454 well my friends and i are investigating a bit of a mystery
7333455 yes the school may not be what you recall a thirst for power has crept into these walls
7333456 i know of the one youre looking for not a month back he showed up at our door a mysterious artifact he had in his palm and this made the chancellor anything but calm since then weve yet to see him out here but we all share the same terrible fear it could be that he has been taken away to the tower of silence by foot east one day a prisoner we think of the chancellors greed but none of us dare to render him freed the artifact though more likely than not is held by the chancellor for whatever plot
7333457 a prison for wizards to put it quite simple a monument to some to others a temple mostly for criminals abusers of power but now a new purpose has befallen the tower theres an old mountain trail hidden by time north of the school find the old broken sign the letters illegible lost to the ages but still a frightening sight for all well versed mages the old road will lead to the place that you seek though be on your guard the places not for the meek
7333458 im afraid my knowledge is limited at best but im sure that youll uncover the rest
7333459 the chancellors words still ring in my mind hell be working at the tower of silence for a time though he tried to pass it off as a temporary career i caught his true meaning in the back of my ear
7333460 i suppose you wont be joining us will you profeesor
7333461 surely my absence would draw some suspicion perhaps itd be best if i sat out this mission
7333462 you know with so many books here do you think thered be some information on the tower of silence
7333463 hmm sera might know where we could find something like that
7333464 well we went to see old zook the kook still rhyming but he had some pretty specific advice
7333465 he said we should go to the tower of silence
7333466 do you have any idea where we could look up some information on this tower
7333467 i dont think thered be anything on it i mean spellcasters are the ones generally stuck there from what i understand they wouldnt want any information about it out in the open
7333468 we may be back later but done for now i finished my exam and we dont want to impose on the schools hospitality
7333469 an opportunity to use this song as a rallying cry for the 2008 dnc in denver
7333470 with graham nashs permission a local colorado band called freedom kage was enlisted to re record the song
7333471 even though all the protest groups involved have pledged to act in a non violent manner
7333472 the city is spending up to 18 million on security equipment and non lethal weapons for the dnc raising fears that the law enforcement is looking for trouble as they were at the 1968 dnc i hope that activists around the country respond to the song and come up to denver in august as in 1968 we need massive numbers of participants to make an impact
7333473 there will be music art speakers workshops marches rallies and networking opportunities for activists from around the country to plan
7333474 environmental peace social justice immigrant rights human rights and the economy are just some of the issues that will be discussed at the denver counter convention
7333475 when we talk about marijuana legalization we shouldnt just be talking about pot
7333476 at todays event there was a real emphasis on the fact that everyone should be concerned about the fact that were wasting incredible amount of public resources on enforcing the prohibition of a peaceful organic substance
7333477 i think that denver officials would be well advised not to believe everything that the fbi warns them about
7333478 thats how things can get out of hand due to fabricated exaggerated projections about violence or protest
7333479 what you saw in 2000 was the claim that 75 000 anarchists were descending the secret funding of permanent police equipment the denial of permits for protesters you saw the same thing in 2004 you will see the same thing in 2008
7333480 re create 68 banner conjuring images of the street clashes that overshadowed the democratic convention itself galvanizing the anti vietnam war effort and undermining democrats hopes in that long ago fall but hayden was there in 1968
7333481 i planned for multiple scenarios not knowing which one would play out
7333482 but certainly after the murder of kennedy coming on the murder of king to me it was in the air that we were going to be busted and face serious harm unless we surrendered and left the city and simply went along with the plan just go along with our own disappearance
7333483 thousands of hairy yippies were going to have sex in public while drinking from the lsd laden waters of lake michigan they actually believed that and this sex in the parks on acid would occur at roughly the same moment that black revolutionaries would storm the convention with guns
7333484 i do think they are playing around unnecessarily with the rights of protesters to protest
7333485 i dont know how the negotiations will come out but you know naming something a protest zone but then not allowing it to be heard or seen its a mockery of the first amendment most importantly its not necessary
7333486 it does seem to me theres a legitimate right to protest at stake
7333487 i dont think the protests will be very large if obama is the nominee i dont see the point in interfering with them its particularly crazy because most of the delegates at the democratic convention have been in many demonstrations themselves
7333488 the message was that the people coming to protest deserve this kind of repression if they get out of hand theyre just trying to scare the public into justifying more tax dollars for a false sense of security more gadgets for the police department
7333489 if they had given us permits i doubt there would have been much confrontation at all
7333490 what caused the rioting in the streets was the lack of permits and the lack of a place to stay too much order creates disorder is the way ive always put it
7333491 you dont have the draft you have one fifteenth of the american casualties now that you had at this point during vietnam the establishment is doing everything it can to keep this war from impacting the american people and yet people have seen through it
7333492 which i think means the ghosts of 68 are still with us people know a quagmire when they see one
7333493 can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad
7333494 reinvest their police budget toward real community security new elementary schools health care for the uninsured providing clean renewable energy
7333495 our taxpayer dollars went to pay people to infiltrate and take notes on our meetings and its absolutely enraging a lot of this homeland security funding is an absolute sham its being used to actually crush dissent not to keep us safer in any real way
7333496 recreate 68 and beat hippies heads like they did in chicago
7333497 the peace bat allows you to make your point without making a mark
7333498 once again the rich orgy of affluence tries to give us another snow job its the same regurgitated circus that we get every four years a liberal fa ade called yippie presents america up for grabs no matter what we still have to take on the bad clowns and the bad circus being perpetrated by corporate cartel are we obamanable or will we suffer under four years of elmer fudd mccain
7333499 especially now with a candidate who talks a lot about hope and change people talk about why do you need to protest
7333500 says zoe williams a local organizer with code pink women for peace and a spokesperson for the alliance for real democracy
7333501 i think that we need to define what hope and change are we need to decide what that means to us as a people
7333502 the story obama tells about how were gonna change this world by regular people taking action
7333503 creates more space for social movement organizing in a way we havent had since the 60s i would like to see the conventions and the protests around them take full advantage of that opportunity
7333504 use both conventions to put forward a narrative that we are starting a new chapter in american history our job is to be part of that progressive wave and to pull it to the left as much as we can
7333505 the candidacy of obama is a reflection of the publics desire for something different
7333506 we believe that despite the rhetoric obama uses genuine change will always come from the bottom up and that means countering the system as a whole
7333507 people have learned that a top down approach to things doesnt work
7333508 what we have in common is a desire to break the spell that elections have over the us left
7333509 our message is one of direct participation in democracy bypassing corrupt politicians who dont represent us but instead further corporate interests
7333510 were just hoping that the denver police dont recreate the violence that happened in chicago in 68
7333511 recreate 68 at the 2008 dnc has become a point of contention all its own even among activists born decades after 1968 and bred amid a new world order
7333512 it provides inspiration and an example of what can be possible
7333513 but it can also prove a disservice if we just recreate 68 we will be destined to also recreate its problems
7333514 look my comments werent meant to be interpreted that harshly

7333517 this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7333518 this is the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
7333519 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7333520 we are very confident but i can not give you a percentage but virtually all of it has been removed
7333521 there have been outbreaks like this before we are getting better at what we do
7333522 my understanding is there were 96 sandwiches produced and 23 sandwiches are outstanding which i think speaks to the level of detail that everybody is going to to get the product back

7333556 tonight we gather under the olympic flag beijing is the focus of the five continents lets gather our strength let wisdom lead the way we have tasted the magical fruit of olympic games surpass it you have witnessed and shared the miracle of life surpass it give dreams the wings to fly
7333557 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7333558 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world athletes from 204 countries came to these dazzling venues and had us in awe with their talent new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marvelled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7333559 the chinese people teeming with enthusiasm have honoured the commitments they solemnly made they have realised the concepts of green olympics high tech olympics and peoples olympics
7333560 to the athletes tonight you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitive rivals from nations in conflict
7333561 keep that spirit alive when you return home these were truly exceptional games

7333564 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7333565 how does this have anything to do with the title of the post
7333566 the current attitude of the kashmir leaders of all hues has convinced us that our own movement for securing a union territory status is justified it has again reinforced our conviction that we want to be directly administered by new delhi
7333567 there is merit in the demand of the people of jammu that the shri amarnath shrine board should be allotted land in the vicinity of the amarnath shrine for the construction of facilities for pilgrims it should be done without delay it will instill faith in the minorities that they are safe in the countrys only muslim majority state
7333568 it hardly bears any reiteration that extremely popular agitation in the jammu region has since brought into sharp focus the larger issue of political empowerment of the people of the region the people are convinced that they will continue to be discriminated against till all religions are considered equal in the real sense of the word
7333569 there are instances galore to prove that jammu has been treated as a poor cousin of kashmir it hurts the most
7333570 all the more so when it is advanced by those who have made mess of the dal lake right under their nose inspite of getting financial aid worth crores of rupees
7333571 everybody has seen and heard that the voices that have been raised in the kashmir valley against the allotment of the land to the shrine board are those of islam and pakistan they are outright communal and anti national how can they be invested with credibility to blame a popular jammu movement as communal why should they be permtited to be raised in the first place why should we continue to give the impression that we are a weak democracy
7333572 in an important matter concerning the state of which we are still a part the largest in terms of area which is revered home of buddhism as well as globally acknowledged schools of shia sect

7333579 jammu and kashmir national panthers party jknpp supremo professor bhim singh an ex supreme court advocate and jammu and kashmir people front jkpf president satish poonchi were today hospitalised after their condition suddenly deteriorated on the fourth and sixth day respectively of their fast unto death
7333580 on the request of chamber the authorities helped in clearing the vehicles stranded in punjab pathankot and other parts of highway where police authorities are still restricting the movement of vehicles towards j amp k due to which jammu is also facing acute shortage of goods and raw material
7333581 the sangharsh samiti is the last word on this movement and bjp is only one among its 42 member units and hence will follow what the samiti says
7333582 there were extremely loud noises coming from the streets and more and more people were pouring on the roads shouting slogans against the minority community while my husband went to look for tickets to jammu i made my son wear his best clothes we stood near the only tank at home there was no other option if my husband didnt return or the mob reached us before him we had to jump into it
7333583 our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer that man is john kerry john kerry understands the ideals of community faith and sacrifice because theyve defined his life from his heroic service in vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor through two decades in the united states senate he has devoted himself to this country again and again weve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available his values and his record affirm what is best in us

7333595 now therefore fear the lord serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river and in egypt serve the lord 15 and if it seems evil to you to serve the lord choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the river or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
7333596 as for me and my house we will serve the lord
7333597 if it seems evil to you to serve the lord if you prefer to serve you fathers gods or the amorite gods

7333607 that was a last minute change and it does present a challenge in that it came about at the last minute
7333608 its really just a matter of relying on the partnerships that were already in place using the same resources to put the event together on somewhat short notice for invesco field
7333609 the future of the next few days is unwritten but the level to which the secret service the federal government and the have already gone to interfere with the free speech rights of protestors is unprecedented
7333610 i think obama and biden together can absolutely help us win colorado
7333611 the west has changed since 1992 its changed a great deal the independents in the west are really looking for leadership
7333612 this year the road to the white house runs through the west
7333613 theres so much in our regional economy of construction development tourism hospitality agriculture in which immigration labor is vital
7333614 and a lot of people realize that closing the border is going to lead to significant changes in things like food prices and food availability
7333615 weve seen the democrats put a lot of interest in trying to win nevada colorado and new mexico theyve sunk a lot of resources into
7333616 i dont think obama is ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7333617 it was an honor to be in that final two or three you know i dont think youd be there unless they concluded you had a lot of positive things to offer and probably not too many negatives
7333618 it always seemed like kind of a longshot to me but it was really really nice to be mentioned
7333619 we didnt hire him for his stunning good looks we hired him for his judgment to lead this country if something happens to barack obama and the judgment and the advice that hell give the next president of the united states
7333620 its really a process for me that was wonderful to be part of because i really came away thinking once again that there are so many great people in public service
7333621 john mccain is going to pick somebody next week and the odds are that either that person will have said things about john mccain
7333622 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7333623 the first person that he sat down and talked to at all about this vice presidential issue was senator clinton they had a discussion back in early june about it
7333624 i dont think theres any question at all that the clintons are wholeheartedly behind barack obama they want to see a democrat elected president of the united states
7333625 she ran a fantastic campaign im a huge admirer of hers
7333626 this ad will have a three day life span when hillary clinton speaks on wednesday night she will blow this ad out of the water

7333633 its not in direct response to that but weve seen much increased activity in terms of russian overflights of canadian airspace the americans are seeing the same thing around alaska
7333634 so thats one element but its not the only element its something that is now starting to give us some cause for serious concern

7333666 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7333667 let me told you what happened gt me i had jus loaded my favorite mule bessie into da gt gt i didnt ask for any details
7333668 i had jus got bessie into da trailer and i was driving down gt da road
7333669 judge i am trying to establish gt the fact that at the scene of the accident this man told the highway gt patrolman on the scene that he was just fine now several weeks after the accident gt he is trying to sue my client i believe he is a fraud please tell him to answer the question
7333670 id like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule bessie
7333671 first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there
7333672 then i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us he responded by poin ting to the ground to show that god was also right here with us
7333673 i pulled out the wine and water to show that god absolves us of all our sins he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin
7333674 he bested me at every move and i could not continue
7333675 first he told me that we had three days to get out of italy so i gave him the finger
7333676 then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews and i told him that we were staying right here
7333677 he took out his lunch so i took out mine
7333678 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7333679 i am looking forward to trying some new events some events ive never really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7333680 bob said to me that hes going to take everything hes done coaching me and throw it out the door and try something completely different just to see how it works
7333681 well try a bunch of new things if were successful great if not we can go back to what weve been doing
7333682 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7333683 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7333684 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7333685 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7333686 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7333687 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7333688 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7333689 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7333690 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7333691 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7333692 a business cant compete a student cant compete our workforce cant compete
7333693 theyre not the latest and greatest and they have their difficulties
7333694 why didnt we do something 10 years ago five years ago three years ago one year ago beats the heck out of me
7333695 its the most obvious thing that we would invest a small amount of money to get our kids not just the hardware but all the software all the visual curriculum and all the teacher development
7333696 people think were much more connected in terms of the internet highway than we are
7333697 my resources are there for lesson planning for sharing ideas and getting amazing curriculum
7333698 theyre not dazzled by doing this its just natural to them they do amazing things

7333706 a hotel like this why why a hotel like this why a regular hotel it has to be at least a 4 star hotel why it cannot be a 4 star hotel i love 4 stars hotels and in the winter when i go skiing i like to go to jacuzzi afterwards a hotel like this wont have one i want my 4 star hotel with my jacuzzi
7333707 please do think about me that im an incompetent loser with no self esteem im also insecure and pathetic plus i cant get it up
7333708 if you are going out of business you dont go down with the ship you get another ship for us its natural gas
7333709 building new wind generation facilities and better utilizing our natural gas resources can replace more than one third of our foreign oil imports in 10 years
7333710 gore asked if we could we join together and do something
7333711 i told him no because global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
7333712 the u s will be importing a significant amount of oil its a step toward energy independence in that it expands renewable energy production but i think framing this debate in terms of energy independence isnt the way to go if you want to take a populist angle on this pushing the very real benefits that wind power and renewables in general can have in local economies stands on much more solid ground
7333713 pickens has stated on numerous occasions that of course hes going to make money off the pickens plan
7333714 thats the nature of what he does and has done but natural gas is probably better used to generate electricity than as a fuel source in cars a better solution is electrically powered vehicles while there are still technical issues if our transportation fleet was all electric you could power it from whatever is the most regionally appropriate way of generating electricity cleanly and cheaply as our ability to generate clean power improves there would be theoretically no need to change the transportation fleet
7333715 gas is not the solution for the future no matter how the gas industry tries to portray it
7333716 with the water crisis looming in the future and his track record on selling water regardless of the environmental cost
7333717 pickens will be viewed in the future as irresponsible his background on promoting renewable energy cant erase his current disregard for the sustainable use of water he recently supplemented his property holdings in texas with 200 000 acres of land atop the ogallala aquifer under texas law this purchase entitles mesa water pickens new company to take more than 320 000 acre feet of water equivalent to more than 104 million gallons from the property the ogallala is already severely depleted and its outrageous that he can stick a pipe in the ground and suck this water out without any environmental impact assessment
7333718 pickens used the enormous wind farm erected on his property as a means to lobby for the right to pipe the ogallala water to a major metropolitan center
7333719 he successfully passed a bill through the texas legislature to allow a water supply district to transport alternative energy and water in a single corridor pickens also successfully loosened the legal definitions of a water district allowing him to invoke the right of eminent domain so that he could build the pipeline through the property of several neighboring landowners we should be concerned with these types of underhanded business dealings
7333720 wow i have that one down pat im anxious about nothing all the time
7333721 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which transcends all your understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
7333722 your transcripts and records were the best organized and documented i have seen
7333723 its tight not that many people are there though there arent that many people in my school
7333724 well the gas prices you know i wana go places but i cant my mom cant drive me its too expensive i have to catch the bus or the lightrail but theyve cleaned the lightrail up a lot now thats more expensive and the taxes those are real expensive too

7333737 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7333738 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7333739 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7333740 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7333741 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
7333742 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7333743 people who know me know that im not a shrinking violet
7333744 i didnt sign up to be the guy who plays the harlem globetrotters
7333745 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
7333746 being on fox is like going into the second room
7333747 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
7333748 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
7333749 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music
7333750 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control

7333760 what the advocates state is that what we dont like is enforcement of the law itself
7333761 congress has mandated enforcement of the law and that is what we are going to continue to do
7333762 in order to have laws and have them have meaning there has to be consequences for violating those laws
7333763 if you have laws and no consequences for violating it you have anarchy
7333764 plenty of us said it was a silly idea and not going to work that the undocumented may be illegal but they are not stupid

7333816 hes had a lot of problems paying his loans back and hes spent an awful lot of time out there talking about his problems rather than trying to pay his loans back
7333817 the cases are so harsh in measuring what an undue hardship is that anybody who is working and maintaining any kind of home life has very little chance of discharging these things in bankruptcy
7333818 at the time that people graduate from school almost everybody is technically eligible for bankruptcy because they have debts that exceed their assets
7333819 why would anyone lend you money if you had the option to walk away
7333820 what wed like to see is that people who have made a good faith effort to repay their student loans but for whatever reasons have hit a hard patch or hit a difficult stretch that there be some flexibility

7333833 extending wealth advisory services is a natural extension of a banks business model we offer such services to all our customers be it individuals trusts small entrepreneurs or corporates
7333834 with the emergence of diversified asset classes significant growth in income levels and awareness among people there is great potential for specialized offerings

7333836 i didnt have any personal wealth advisor to guide me on investment planning banks coming with such services help to plan our savings and makes matters more convenient

7333841 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable

7333888 id like to thank the 1 75 million democrats that got out and voted and showed their opinion at the voting booth this is a gift to them
7333889 you can challenge a system that doesnt work well and still wind up on your feet
7333890 i am not going to lie it feels good to be out of camp
7333891 as soon as they told us we could broke i broke went home and got in my own bed wed been at the hotel so long its almost like i had to adjust to my own home
7333892 i had to hit safeway first thing and then i just enjoyed the day at home watching my own television and getting caught up on all of my shows
7333893 its a great opportunity to get out of the training room first of all but to get back on the field and get back in sync with the offense
7333894 it was tough to watch but theres nothing i can really do with a hamstring strain ive been rehabbing it and now i can get back out there i just want to get my timing down get in sync with the offense with all of the motioning the alignment and just get out there and have fun making plays
7333895 its good to finally get out of the training room and back on the field and to get the timing down with the quarterbacks especially j t since hes going to be the guy
7333896 j t knows how to make plays when stuff doesnt go exactly as its drawn up he still knows how to get the job done and make plays on the fly its very important to hone in our skills and shape up the offense and get everyone tuned in for arizona
7333897 i actually felt like i was part of something again i did a lot of individual work ran a lot of routes just trying to get back into the swing of things its strong now and nothing is going to happen to it but when you have surgery three weeks ago you are still kind of thinking about it its just mental
7333898 its nice to know who our starter is because going back and forth you dont necessarily get that timing you want
7333899 osullivan might throw a certain route one way alex might come in and throw it another and shaun a third way so it goes back and forth i think its good to know who our starting quarterback is so we can get that timing and chemistry going
7333900 i think its very good for the team to know who the starter is now
7333901 we get to rally behind jt now and giving him the confidence that we believe in him and hopefully he believes in us and we can go out and win together
7333902 im very excited about the season and the opportunity to go into the season were getting ready for san diego this week and arizona at the start of the season
7333903 i flat out dont agree with their decisions to cut me and thats why im still playing
7333904 ive just always thought i could play so it didnt waver when one personnel guy or one gm or one coach told me i wasnt good enough for that team
7333905 my first year was with jake delhomme being in green bay with guys who didnt have straight stories brad johnson shaun hill also guys in chicago theres a long list of guys i personally know and guys who i know through europe there just flat out arent clean stories jon kitna another guy who made his way in europe got an opportunity in seattle and made the most of it had to battle for a spot in cincinnati and now is playing well in detroit
7333906 i really think when you realize that and you put it on yourself and control how you play and if you are a good enough there will be a spot for you
7333907 i think its a testament to his hard work and with the competition at the position i think he emerged in the coaches eyes and got the job done
7333908 he does have really good accuracy and he fits well into the scheme of things
7333909 you have to be doing things really good to be the leader of a mike martz offense
7333910 if i stepped back and looked at it that might sink in more
7333911 right now im trying to do everything i can to focus on my preparation and my performance but yeah growing up a niners fan i understand what this position is to the area so im excited
7333912 ill adjust with it and continue with my development continue getting better continue coming to work every day motivated i cant let that stop me i cant let that get to me in my progress and where i want to go im going to continue to work and get better with this
7333913 cuts today we let five players go this morning joe cohen cooper wallace lewis baker kyle wright and john booker a few guys went through individual training and we hope that monday theyll practice with us but they just did individuals and that is ashley lelie michael robinson and arnaz battle guys who right now i would tentatively say are not playing in the game are bryant johnson adam snyder jonas jennings and allen rossum well go from there with the rest jeff ulbrich by the way also did individual and then he stopped right there but i expect him on monday to be back out
7333914 my expectation is that everyone will be healthy next week on our roster so there could be one or two of those guys who might not heal as quickly as wed like but right now my anticipation is that well be a healthy squad next week with the injuries that we have hopefully we dont have any new ones
7333915 well see at that time well wait until we see what he can give us
7333916 wed leave wragge right now where hes at again a lot of that depends on the synder baas issue weve got two guys there who were hoping will play next week and obviously in the opener see how much of baas we can get into this week as much as we know about david we really dont know what kind of shape hes in and all of that so well see
7333917 i thought our depth was better there than at tackle we were actually looking for tackles when we signed barry sims we were looking more for those guys than we were looking for interior linemen but right now i think that our numbers are okay
7333918 he did okay he did some good things tommie harris who is a pro bowl player got the better of him a couple of times but i thought he did all right considering
7333919 good question i cant answer that right now well see where were at on monday robert ortiz is the backup punt returner right now but if battle is able to play in the game well give him a couple of punts i dont know there are just some possibilities but i dont have a good answer for you right now
7333920 mark is a very good player and so is goldson both have done a great job goldson comes in on all of the sub package stuff now we do a number of things on that first and second down with that package also so we feel pretty good that were getting our best players on the field often enough so hes not just doing special teams and standing on the sidelines
7333921 hes an experienced guy and i dont think that it gets him out of his game at all and im assuming that the device would get someone out of theirs but im just pretty confident that it wouldnt get him out of his game he takes it on real well with some guys it might fluster them a little bit with something else going on but really i just wanted to give it to somebody mature and marks a pretty mature guy
7333922 yeah to get his attention we told chicago to get his attention a couple of plays
7333923 well jeff ulbrich and takeo spikes are both working there really not a final decision has been made right now were still repping them both takeo is making steady progress he is doing a good job and jeff when hes in there does a good job also so with jeff getting banged up like he did allows takeo to take advantage of getting some more reps but no decisions have been made
7333924 all of them do hes no different than anybody else
7333925 oh for sure laughing and for that big paycheck but hes keith lewis doing alright
7333926 he threw to isaac bruce a couple of times the other night when he had the opportunity that was good whoever is in the game with him i would expect him too thats what is real important about offense its the discipline you have to be at the right spot you dont want to fool the quarterback so these young guys when j t has been throwing to them have been where they need to be josh morgan has been reliable in the games they have played and therefore he got the ball he was where he needed to be last week the same thing with jason hill whoever is in there has to be accountable and trustworthy otherwise the quarterback gets fooled
7333927 it only matters if the person is not reliable the only thing that will make a difference is if someone is so doggone slow or so doggone fast that they throw the timing way off but everyone is pretty close the target area is big enough in that everyone can catch it
7333928 it does matter how fast or slow you are but everybody is pretty much the same whether you are 4 4 4 5 or 4 6 that tenth of a second doesnt throw everyone off the key thing to say is that it is a very disciplined detailed attack defense is no different it allows for the quarterback to trust where you are going to be its not one of those hey find an open area and i will throw you the ball there is a lot more to it thats why you see the quarterback getting rid of the ball before guys come out of their break this approach is be where you are supposed to be because when he lets it go as you have seen on television they are not even out of their break thats important
7333929 i guess so laughing i dont think he was in much of a break on that one
7333930 no the quarterback tries to draw everyone to him and flick the ball it becomes like a trap and they get it up inside its a big philadelphia play down on the goal line they use it as their two point play all of the time even though we all know it right now you watch they will use it on the goal line and get two points they are really trying to bait the defense its a deceptive play like a screen draw or trap they try to invite guys to go to a certain place and get trapped
7333931 the quarterback tries to draw you the lineman has to close the run and take the quarterback on the pass so he is in a dilemma hes got both jobs why dont people run it all of the time because there are also other guys twisting and doing things too
7333932 well he hasnt played any it would be very hard to start him because that would throw the quarterback off if he gets enough work during the week then maybe we can feel confident that he will participate and help us it looks we will play our wide receivers a little bit because of the injury situation we had in training camp a number of them have to get the details of their jobs down
7333933 right now i will leave it up in the air and we will wait and see
7333934 a business cant compete a student cant compete our workforce cant compete
7333935 theyre not the latest and greatest and they have their difficulties
7333936 why didnt we do something 10 years ago five years ago three years ago one year ago beats the heck out of me
7333937 its the most obvious thing that we would invest a small amount of money to get our kids not just the hardware but all the software all the visual curriculum and all the teacher development
7333938 people think were much more connected in terms of the internet highway than we are
7333939 my resources are there for lesson planning for sharing ideas and getting amazing curriculum

7333943 i had a herniated disc before i got here i guess that would be the red flag
7333944 we knew that everyone knew that it just was a thing where most people it doesnt affect it wasnt affecting me so if nothing is broke you dont fix it then something happened in practice that second day the disc started moving and that caused some problems
7333945 i didnt miss a practice or a game in college
7333946 obviously if it was something serious i would have because if i could play with it in college i sure as hell could play with it for money
7333947 im pretty sure i am ahead of schedule in my rehab
7333948 we are not unduly worried and we have enough to keep prices in a certain price band
7333949 as much as i love allen iversons spirit he is yet another example of that fact that no matter how much money or status you have that you are not freed from the mental slavery

7333970 todays announcement of national bravery awards recognises the heroic actions of those amongst us who have placed the safety and lives of others before their own
7333971 we are privileged to have such role models in our society and it is an honour to be able to recognise their acts of selfless bravery and thank them publicly
7333972 unfortunately im not sure that our dealings with russia have mirrored the changes that have taken place there
7333973 and at the same time they have nursed a lot of grudges that having made a comeback and having achieved recovery they are still being treated like they were in 1995
7333974 i believe that in order to improve relations with russia it is necessary not to pull the former soviet republics into political military blocs but to develop relations with russia itself
7333975 and then the actions of the bloc in a few years will not be perceived so acutely in this country as is the case today
7333976 a lot of times in politics you have people look you in the eye and tell you whats not on their mind
7333977 he looks you in the eye and tells you whats on his mind hes been very truthful and to me thats the only way you can find common ground and to be able to deal in a way that you dont let your disputes interrupt your relationships
7333978 on these kinds of things as president kennedy did during the cuban missile crisis you deal with the points that are being made on the other side with which you can agree or with which you want to work
7333979 we all tend to believe that mr putin calls the main shots even if mr medvedev tends from time to time to look like a friendlier bear to deal with
7333980 it shows a mindset about russia that tends to see it through the neoconservative prism of basically being a soviet threat
7333981 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7333982 the olympics have increased chinese peoples confidence at first there was a lot of criticism but since the opening ceremony and the start of the games theres been widespread praise and this comes in a year where our confidence was shaken by natural disasters and other events
7333983 china is trying to show to the world this face that they are a modern progressing country thats open access for everyone and it really is not the truth the real face is one that denies freedom of speech that denies it brutally and violently when it can
7333984 perhaps some of the western governments and human rights organizations had it backwards where they expected that the olympics would be a time for more freedom
7333985 i think the government and i think theres substantial popular support for this view view the olympics in a very different way as a time to have temporary controls on society
7333986 after discovering that thermal expansion of steel from a low temperature fire led to the collapse of world trade center building 7
7333987 we started realising that other metal objects might also be at risk
7333988 we also determined that car engines airplane engines and boat engines could all suddenly fail due to thermal expansion
7333989 indeed we soon realised that could lead to catastrophic failure other than perhaps those used in freezers
7333990 once you understand this principle of thermal expansion you start to realise that even household shower heads and faucets are dangerous the hot water flowing through them could wreak havoc the president is committed to leading the way back to a safer time and a return to proven traditional materials which may not be flashy like metal but remain rock solid even when warm

7333993 yes its true its a french bike thats over 30 years old and ill keep right on riding it all the way to washington it represents something weve lost as a people and thats the simple determination to build things that last how many of you are still driving the car you had 30 years ago you put more money into that vehicle than ive ever spent on this bike and that car and all your money is long gone why dont we build things to last rather than make them disposable think of it this way if we built consumer goods to last a lifetime if we build them to be repairable wed have money to spend on other things in life like better educations for our kids better medical care or maybe a house on the lake or some other dream thats just out of reach it requires changing our priorities rather than building new factories overseas to turn out more goods wed be spending our money employing local people in small businesses so sure i ride a french bike thats over 30 years old if i can keep it repaired ill ride if for another 30 years

7334012 shes going to be an important an important voice in this campaign
7334013 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time

7334033 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7334034 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7334035 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7334036 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7334037 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7334038 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones

7334041 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7334042 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7334096 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7334097 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7334098 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7334099 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7334151 we will see who wants to be part of this and then we will get a manager that everybody will be happy with and i know alex ferguson has been approached by seb coe and i have spoken to him about it
7334152 ich m chte dass die amerikaner sich auf die frage konzentrieren ob wir es uns leisten k nnen diese politik weitere vier oder acht jahre fortzusetzen
7334153 there will be resolution after resolution amendment after amendment just like in the days of vietnam
7334154 the pressure will mount the president will find he has no strategy
7334155 they decided that were just not going to address the issue of islamic symbolism
7334156 dim all the lights sweet darling cause i want to hide my love handles
7334157 the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he wasnt real
7334158 a force diametrically opposed to the constructive energies as represented by the deity
7334159 a potent symbolic reminder of the duality of humanity in that one cannot have good without evil to contrast it
7334160 in england the police would have given me a ticket here you can talk your way out of these things
7334161 ill send you the holy ghost ill send you a comforter ill send you a redeemer ill send you a counselor
7334162 always remain in the centre do not worry about your growth in
7334163 we should be careful when we express our views about the nature of others and their doings by keeping in mind that our knowledge is always incomplete other people form their opinions views on the basis of our statements we can praise good virtues and appreciate good qualities of others to the extent possible but we must control ourselves while criticizing others and their bad qualities we should talk only what our experience tells we should not try to generalize anything merely on the basis of our single example
7334164 warum trennt ihr sie ist f r euch nicht alles ein und dasselbe
7334165 aber jeder einzelne ist auf seine eigene art zufrieden isst ein mensch das gras das die kuh gern frisst schmeckt der kuh das essen der menschen man soll mensch und tier nur das geben was jeden zufriedenstellt
7334166 now these ekadesha rudras come out of as i told you from the void so we can say that the destruction part of it comes from the void mainly but these are the powers all given in one
7334167 shri krishna has become the virata the great primordial being so this is the 11th power of destruction he has the power called samhara shakti by which he kills people so before killing them and finishing them off in the compassion of your mother we have to first try to transform them if they cannot be transformed then its alright then let ekadasha take over so these 11 very great destructive powers will be used by the kalki the one who is going to manifest on a white horse before that today is a very great day that we are going to use these powers for transformation
7334168 so today i was thinking that well have the puja of shri vishnu who was the basis of dharma so far we have never worshipped anyone who were the basics except for shiva we only worshipped the incarnations ganesha came as incarnation the goddess came as incarnations rama shri krishna gurus christ buddha all of them came as incarnations on this earth and we worshipped the specially but today as sahaja yoga is established is dharma we have to know about shri vishnu who is the basis of dharma later on and ultimately as kalki it is a beautiful so one has to understand what is the basis of dharma if you know in the matter there are eight valences theyre negative positive and neutral but in human beings there are ten valences and these ten valences are created by shri vishnu within us they are protected looked after and nourished by shri vishnu and whenever he finds human beings falling down in their dharma on this earth ultimate stage is the virat at that stage this vishnu principle divides into two one goes to virat another to viratangana but the third principle is what you call as the mahavishnu which incarnated as lord jesus christ so all these three principles act at this time in sahasrara mainly
7334169 in evolution every incarnation has come on this earth to open a door within us and to create that opening or that enlightenment in our awareness
7334170 now if you study the etymology of the word christ you would know that the word has originated from a corrupted form of the word krishna as a matter of fact the father of jesus christ is shri krishna that is why he is called christ the manner in which his name jesus originated is also very interesting the mother of shri krishna shri yashoda mata was addressed as yesu even today we notice that in northern india somebody named yeshu is not addressed as such but as jesus it is therefore clear that from yashoda came the word yeshu and then further became the word finally the name jesus christ
7334171 shri ganesha is the eldest brother of all the sahaja yogis in the university of sahaja yoga one has to be registered through the permission of shri ganesha who is responsible for judging every student sadhaka who wants to enrol in the university after passing through four classes of four chakras nabhi chakra swadhisthan chakra ridhaya chakra and vishuddhi chakra shri ganesha bestows a graduation degree upon the pupil as chancellor of the university where this is the awakened stage of the sadhaka
7334172 so all the miracles of god cannot be explained and should not be explained they are beyond our mind and to make people feel the presence of god god can do anything he can move into all the dimensions a nd also into the fourth dimension he can do whatever he feels like
7334173 there is a very perfect mechanism placed along the spinal chord like a remote control and it has seven loops which is called soul in the scriptures the soul is responsible for looking after our well being the righteousness and goodness within the human mind it saves us from our destruction by controlling the inner atmosphere of the cell through the receptor when this soul is challenged by the wrong deeds of a person it acts on the receptor of a cell that would otherwise ultimately disturb the inner atmosphere of the cell changing the series of the data base units of the cell in the d n a thus from the genes one can know the character of the person which is very much acquired even the chromosomes which are called autosomes which are for the physical aspect can get into changes like kobe steaks or broiled chicken even in human beings it goes into shapes of the body which can be acquired by physical emotional or mental activity these genes could be partly inherent not being in a proper series before birth according to the nature of the mother and father because of our day to day life especially in modern times which disturbs the inner atmosphere of the cell thus disturbances change the series of data bases indicating the total character genetically inherent or acquired by the person
7334174 you are as stupid as everyone else you are nothing but a fake
7334175 tell me if you buy a gift for someone and that person does not take it to whom does the gift belong
7334176 it would belong to me because i bought the gift
7334177 that is correct and it is exactly the same with your anger if you become angry with me and i do not get insulted then the anger falls back on you you are then the only one who becomes unhappy not me all you have done is hurt yourself
7334178 if you want to stop hurting yourself you must get rid of your anger and become loving instead
7334179 so this attention must be brought round you judge yourself where is your attention and what is the point of understanding what is the measure of understanding its very simple i have to be pleased because i am the attention if i am pleased then you have done the job
7334180 kehre zur ck zur quelle und finde die stille das ist der weg der natur
7334181 shri krishna has become the virata the great primordial being so this is the 11th power of destruction he has the power called samhara shakti by which he kills people so before killing them and finishing them off in the compassion of your mother we have to first try to transform them if they cannot be transformed then its alright then let ekadasha take over so these 11 very great destructive powers will be used by the kalki the one who is going to manifest on a white horse before that today is a very great day that we are going to use these powers for transformation
7334182 mother now we have got realization we have a nice life we are enjoying ourselves and we are doing so well
7334183 and then you start acting according to the spirit once you start acting according to the spirit you will find that you have no slavery of anything you become
7334184 equal to your meaning samartha also means a powerful personality so you develop that powerful personality which has no temptations which has no wrong ideas which has no catches no problems

7334186 unfortunately i wont be receiving a new samsung phone or a copy of an ea game any time soon
7334187 he gives it his all on every second of every play you see that and youre like youve got to do the same thing
7334188 you see a guy playing that hard youll do anything not to let him down
7334189 one of the funniest politically incorrect comedians out there whos very blunt about his stand on religion is going to have a documentary released this coming october titled
7334190 it could practically be considered a sequel a continuation since the story is about the possibility of the descendants of jesus anyway oops did i spoil that for you who havent seen it yet
7334191 between 1962 and 1967 two notes appeared in our mailbox there was a single sentence written on them i am doing fine but if those letters were really from my father i do not know
7334192 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7334193 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7334194 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7334195 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7334196 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7334197 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7334198 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7334199 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7334200 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7334201 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7334202 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7334203 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7334204 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7334205 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference
7334206 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7334207 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7334208 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7334209 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7334210 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
7334211 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7334212 people who know me know that im not a shrinking violet
7334213 i didnt sign up to be the guy who plays the harlem globetrotters
7334214 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
7334215 being on fox is like going into the second room
7334216 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7334217 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7334218 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7334219 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7334220 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7334221 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7334222 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7334223 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7334224 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7334225 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7334226 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7334227 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7334228 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7334229 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof

7334235 it would appear that ning decided to elminate widgetlaboratory for anti competitive purposes alone
7334236 longstanding policy against publicly discussing third party widgets and applications as well as the details of terms of service violations
7334237 our only goal is to have you build your products in such a way that doesnt slow down the networks running your products or takedown the ning platform with what youre doing both of those would result in us needing to shutdown widgetlaboratory products and thats has never been our first choice of options hopefully you know this after 8 months of working with us
7334238 if we have evidence other than our conversation last night that you are asking for username password and pin of other network creators on widgetlaboratory we will be put in the unfortunate situation of shutting down your network and widgets we dont want to do this in fact wed like very much to work more closely together but we can only do so if everything you guys are doing is within the terms of service
7334239 when did multiple violations of tos become some kind of expected right where everyone pats each other on the back singing songs drinking beers and saying its all good and then only after the most flagrant who decides is there action metered out
7334240 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7334241 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7334242 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7334243 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7334244 try to use that word or those words more often
7334245 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7334246 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7334247 that it may be fraudulent and get on down here and do you job
7334248 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7334249 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7334250 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7334251 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7334252 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7334253 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7334254 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7334255 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7334256 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7334257 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7334258 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7334259 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7334260 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7334261 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7334262 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7334263 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7334264 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7334265 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants

7334296 non importa quanto male mi farete mi potrete togliere tutto ma non la libert
7334297 certo che i fascisti sono stati davvero un barlume di speranza per i diritti civili del genere umano certamente i suoi adepti futuri brilleranno sotto la stessa costellazione battendosi con tutte le loro forze per non organizzare colpi di stato innescare bombe in centri abitati atti a creare una strage non avvalleranno alcuna guerra imperialista al solo scopo di massacrare cittadini inermi no sono certo che i suoi nipotini diventeranno yogi a tempo pieno e combatteranno il male urbi et orbi

7334373 back off kruisheer wie zit hier altijd tot middernacht de statistieken van nota bene jouw zogenaamde d7 pareltjes bij te werken en wie laat je de verslagen schrijven bart rahem richard de hele familie huisman pim dirk noem maar op zelf doe je geen flikker
7334374 krijgen we nou jij laat hendrik altijd het vuile schrijfwerk opknappen volgens mij rijdt ie nog altijd met een grote boog om volendam en ijmuiden heen en shoppen
7334375 dat is nou wat je kritische journalistiek noemt hou ik van worden die jongens hard van neem dan die slappe stukkies van jou wel geinig geschreven maar heeft niks met voetbal te maken
7334376 tot hier en niet verder kwestie van smaak en daarmee basta trouwens wie moeten altijd fotos maken precies liesbeth richard lenno en ik en anders laat je fred weer van die sublieme plaatjes schieten jou zelfs nog nooit een camera zien v sthouden daar is de heer bos veel te neurotisch voor langs de lijn
7334377 hoef je niet te vragen belangrijker wat kunnen we nog publiceren
7334378 iets over jullie trainer brono misschien zou die binnenkort niet eens vader worden
7334379 no way joost zn vriendin is altijd op reis raakkans van 0 misschien wat anders bijvoorbeeld dat wazehindus trainer van fc almere d1 wordt schijnt echt waar te zijn
7334380 oud nieuws jan oud nieuws is echt waar en hij neemt ook nog het cr me de la cr me van de d11 mee maar dat weet iedereen ook al wordt een topteam en zal me niks verbazen als wazehindus d1 in de competitiepoule bij onze d2 komt
7334381 wat lekker verhaal zal mijn zoon leuk vinden door zijn oude maatjes aan flarden geschoten worden onder leiding van zijn eerste echte trainer op wie die zo gesteld is
7334382 ook dat is voetbal jan soms vraag ik me af of je niet teveel watje bent voor een bvo als fc omniworld
7334383 godsamme joost gaan we nou weer katten ik bekijk het soms net ff anders dan jij en heb kameraadschap hoog in het vaandel is toch gewoon leuk als die jongens lang in n team blijven voetballen trouwens van al die talenten zullen er uiteindelijk maar een paar cht prof worden moet jij toch weten mister statistics
7334384 goed goed ik geef toe ik kan nogal doordrammen over kwaliteit en mentale hardheid maar daar is niks mis mee doe er je voordeel mee zou ik zeggen
7334385 point taken we dwalen af onderwerpen joost onderwerpen zit er misschien iets in het gerucht dat kirk zuidpool is benaderd door ajax om daar verzorger te worden
7334386 huh weet ik niks van maar als dat zo is is dat jouw schuld die fotos van kirk op topsnelheid over het veld met waterzak en al ik zei nog publiceer nou niet want daar komt ellende van heb je nou je zin
7334387 nergens spijt van joost is toch mooi als je m nog eens op tv ziet rennen om huntelaar op te lappen kan je zeggen dat wij hem persoonlijk gekend hebben voor een bvo een absolute topper welke verzorger loopt de 100 meter nou binnen de 15 seconden hallo met waterzak en al ja en algemene zaken doet ie er in n moeite bij
7334388 allemaal mooi en aardig maar dat publiceren we niet doen we toch nooit met onbevestigde berichten
7334389 heb jij weer gelijk in maar het is zo jammer zou een prachtige scoop zijn in combinatie met die interesse voor decki
7334390 ja joost the one and only decki sinds danny blind haar als stadionspeaker hoorde wil hij haar ab so luut naar de arena halen hij vindt haar stem misschien nog wel lekkerder mokums dan jij en ik samen zo warm daarom zei bvo coach peter schurke ook dat hij fc omniworld zon oergezellige club vond
7334391 zou me niks verbazen joost al die schapen van het eerste uur zijn natuurtalenten in het combineren van functies draaien ze hun poot sorry hand niet voor om
7334392 laat me raden gatie noordpool is ook onderdeel van deze supertransfer
7334393 nog niks over gehoord maar dat kan niet uitblijven where kirk goes gatie goes vroeger of later komen die altijd weer samen bij ajax wordt gatie vast iets van internal troubleshooter dat doet ie bij fc omniworld met verve en na een cursusje spaans zie ik hem suarez ook wel aanspreken op wildplassen ik hoor het hem al helemaal zeggen e louis urina stricta prohibida of zoiets en reken maar dat ze naar hem luisteren
7334394 ja een man van d den als het moet grijpt ie in ik zie hem van basten ook persoonlijk op non actief zetten als het rommelt bij ajax desnoods gaat gatie zelf een half jaartje in de dug out zitten
7334395 en je ziet never nooit meer een ajacied met een patatje m t lopen geldt dat verbod trouwens ook voor een patatje z nder vergeten te vragen op de informatieavond
7334396 wat kan jij toch zeiken fc omniworld is een fatsoenlijke club en selectiespelers horen gewoon niet
7334397 of met ketchup dan die vlekken zie je niet op dat donkere masita spul oorlog kan natuurlijk niet pindasaus lijkt me een grensgeval weet jij hoe dat vlekt joost
7334398 dit is de limit dat eeuwige geouwehoer over niks gewoon g n patat tostis broodje kaas en ham toegestaan daarmee basta was gatie toch helder over zoals altijd met die man die st t voor wat ie zegt uitgeluld jan dank u terug naar het onderwerp de transfer van dat trio is natuurlijk nog niet bevestigd
7334399 klopt sorry kunnen we ook al niks mee op de weblog
7334400 ja rens en kajum jeweetwel van voetbalvaders nl die hebben een partij organisatietalent en pr ervaring wil je niet weten trekken zomaar effe een reuzensponsor aan bandencentrum almere mag ik u even spreken ban den cen trum al me re heeft rens volgens mij geregeld gewoon effe tussendoor toen ie nieuwe bandjes liet monteren
7334401 dacht al dat ik hem telkens zag slippen als ie bij fc omniworld wegreed niet alleen op de parkeerplaats ook op het veld als je het mij vraagt weet je nog dat hij die ene wedstrijd floot had ie het zwaar h
7334402 moeillijke westrijd jan moeilijke wedstrijd stond veel op het spel en al die ouders langs de kant maar schreeuwen die zijn het ergste maar hij stond daar toch maar mooi sinds die wedstrijd eet hij principieel geen paling meer je begrijpt wel waarom
7334403 vlak kajum niet uit mediageniek dat die gast is zou me niks verbazen als sbs6 hem binnenkort inlijft is fc omniworld mooi te laat met een opvolger voor decki perfecte stadionspeaker misschien de stembandjes nog een beetje smeren met mokumer olie want het moet wel gezellig blijven maar dan kan ie zo achter de microfoon
7334404 heeft ie ook geen last meer van dat commentaar achter m als ie staat te vlaggen gun ik hem van harte
7334405 die moeders achter m zijn nog erger dan die vaders die bekkies staan nooit stil maar wel allemaal in de pose springen als ik fotootjes schiet en w t voor poses ranzig joost r nzig
7334406 is me vaker bij je opgevallen jij ziet alleen maar voetbal noem je tunnelvisie geeft niks hoor doe ik anders ik kijk altijd naar het h le gebeuren holistische benadering weetjewel kun jij ook leren heel belangrijk heeft allemaal invloed op het spelletje
7334407 arrogante klootzak altijd weer die belerende praatjes allemaal interessante grootspraak die zogenaamd ranzige plaatjes heb ik trouwens nooit gezien
7334408 zoek ze wel ff voor je op even kijken waar heb ik ze ook alweer mapje te erg ja hier heb ik m niet schrikken hoor
7334409 begrijp je nou wat ik bedoel non publicado natuurlijk we hebben een nette weblog
7334410 e n keertje per ongeluk toch eentje geplaatst schoot ik uit met mn muis gedonder mee gehad joh
7334411 toen je al die vaders een dag later in je mailbox had
7334412 precies of ik haar mobiele nummertje had niet gedaan natuurlijk rot op met je nummertje doe dat ff lekker bij je eigen thuis privacy h ken je niet maken en heb je dr man wel eens gezien b m van een kerel type commando moet je geen trammelant mee krijgen
7334413 kan brono zich nog wel concentreren op de wedstrijd met al die hot mamas langs de kant ik bedoel maar zn vriendin is toch altijd op reis
7334414 dat zeg ik en het is wel een jonge hond testosteron 500 mot toch een weg hebben
7334415 heb je gelijk in en ik zie hem toch altijd alleen maar met de wedstrijd bezig zijn vakman fully dedicated kijk op het spelletje altijd positief nooit chagrijnig wat is zijn geheim
7334416 dat is het joost gewoon het hele seizoen op een drooggie en vrijkomende energie voor de volle 100 voor je werk gebruiken de re ncarnatie van zen himself z word je dus coach van het jaar
7334417 nogal bijzondere benadering maar er zit wat in en kirk hoe reageert die op die moeders
7334418 nooit zo op gelet eigenlijk maar kan me niet voorstellen dat ie zich laat afleiden rust zelve die man en altijd druk met de club nooit ergens anders tijd voor teammanager kon er eigenlijk niet meer bij maar ja bloed kruipt waar het niet gaan kan uitstervend ras hoor die schaappies
7334419 viel me we op dat hij in de tweede helft van het seizoen steeds verder van brono af ging staan bij de wedstrijden het fc omniworld tenue had ie ook nooit meer aan
7334420 waarschijnlijk te heet gewassen laten die initialen los h schaamt ie zich misschien voor maar we dwalen alweer af allemaal niks voor op de weblog kom jij nou eens met iets
7334421 ik word hier bloednerveus van jij zegt dat zo makkelijk nieuws m ken maar er is gewoon niks wacht ns even misschien heb ik nog iets over kajum dat is toch ook jullie linesman ving gister op dat ie is gebeld door jaap uilenberg was zo onder de indruk van zijn onpartijdigheid dat kajum de verkorte opleiding tot scheidsrechter schijnt te mogen volgen
7334422 punten dat kajum ons gekost heeft p nten dat wil je niet w ten altijd maar goudeerlijk vlaggen terwijl de grens van de andere partij de hele wedstrijd door lang zal ze leven staat te vlaggen slaat echt he le maal nergens op
7334423 krijgen we nou jij die altijd de bek vol hebt van fatsoen en eerlijk duurt het langst nu opeens je eigen topgrens afvallen je valt diep jan heel diep
7334424 je hebt gelijk joost beloof me dat ie dit nooit te weten komt ik ben ook maar een mens en dat d7 wijntje dat ik net inschenk is ook nogal koppig die kajum is goud maar laatst in die toernooifinale
7334425 kappen hij vlagt zoals het hoort en is dus een sieraad voor de club en je zei zelf dat de d7 er in de eerste 5 minuten gewoon 3 in had moeten schieten geen woord meer hierover hoor je me geen woord en dat verhaal over uilenberg is ook maar een gerucht dus daar zit ook al geen stukkie in
7334426 ok ok sorry ik liet me ff gaan nog een druppie van die heerlijke d7 wijn joost heb jij daar nou voor moois hangen
7334427 gekregen van de d11 spelers en hun ouders voor al die bewezen diensten met de weblog enzo
7334428 hoor hem be we zen dienst en vraag me af waar ze dan op doelen maar ik moet toegeven prachtig stukkie canvas
7334429 wat nou stukkie canvas weer zon sneer je bent gewoon keihard jaloers ik heb iets voor de eeuwigheid jouw d7 flessie ligt morgen in de glasbak w g aandenken je kan gewoon niet uitstaan dat ik populairder ben dan jij
7334430 pffffff hulde aan de man die lulde als jij wilt denken dat je zo goed ligt moet je dat maar lekker koesteren word ik hier moe van zeg en nog steeds niks voor op de weblog hoe moet dat nou
7334431 shit jan zitten we hier al uren te praten en we zitten gewoon weer waar ik mee begon er is gewoon niks nada laten we ermee kappen
7334432 w t en al onze trouwe bezoekers dan wil je trouwens niet zo van die wijn slempen das pure d7 kwaliteit en daar moet je van nippen zuiplap het is geen jupiler bier
7334433 kalm kalm jan doe mij anders maar een biertje voor zon jupilertje kun je me altijd wakker maken die trouwe bezoekers kunnen binnenkort terecht op de vernieuwde site van de jeugdopleiding als je weer nuchter bent mag je daar van gatie vast op verder pennen
7334434 ik ben helemaal niet dronken wat denk je wel zei je ook alweer o ja nieuwe site van de jeugdopleiding zal erover denken zijn we alleen niet meer onafhankelijk dus als je iets gevoeligs schrijft kan een of ander opperschaap gewoon censuur toepassen toch
7334435 wat ben je toch een schijterd in principe kan dat maar het lijkt me uitgesloten ze weten toch dat we het voetbalhart op de goede plaats hebben
7334436 ok maar ik moet even aan het idee wennen hebben we de begroting trouwens al sluitend kunnen krijgen
7334437 helaas sluiten we dit webjaar af met een tekort van 29 50 maar dat verdienen we in de toekomst tig keer terug
7334438 al die fotos jan al die fotos als er maar eentje van die dertig d11 en d7 spelers een echte ster wordt lopen we lachend binnen verkopen wij zijn fotos als jeugdvoetballer voor heul veul geld
7334439 voor deze ene keer zouden we toch het verslag van deze redactievergadering publiceren
7334440 shit das waar ook ik heb toch niks gezegd waar ik later spijt van krijg
7334441 nee ben je mal ze kunnen je nergens op pakken doe jij het licht uit
7334442 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies
7334443 today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
7334444 nuns are women above all else and beauty is a gift from god
7334445 but you need a bit of courage to do something like this nuns deserve much more attention they they get
7334446 there is also such a thing as a chaste ideal which comes from the heart and the soul and has a beneficial effect on those who come into contact with it after all did not the russian writer dostoyevsky say that beauty would save the world
7334447 i have had some e mails from christians who perhaps have not grasped the evangelising spirit of the initiative or the potential of the internet which is a marvellous tool for spreading the christian message unfortunately some people still have a closed mentality
7334448 the dignity is so ancient that the insignia of the pharaoh evidently belonged to the time when egyptians wore nothing but the girdle of the negro
7334449 in their complex and many of the complexions and in physical peculiarities the egyptians were an
7334450 the ancient egyptians were true negroes of the same type as all native born africans that being so we can see how their blood mixed for several centuries with that of the romans and greeks must have lost the intensity of its original color while retaining none the less the imprint of its original mold we can even state as a general principle that the face referring to the sphinx is a kind of monument able in many cases to attest to or shed light on historical evidence on the origins of the people
7334451 what a subject for meditation just think that the race of black men today our slaves and the object of our scorn is the very race to which we owe our arts science and even the use of our speech
7334452 this is a grievous mourning to the egyptians and hebrews
7334453 setis face was thoroughly african he had a stormy face with a depressed flat nose thick lips and heavy chin
7334454 in mr kahsays homeland he is shunned as a leper as white pigment is considered a sign of the disease
7334455 and smote all the firstborn in egypt the tabernacles house of ham khawm
7334456 israel also came into egypt and sojourned in the land of ham khawm
7334457 they showed his signs among them and wonders in the land of ham khawm
7334458 who is the true messiah heaven and hell the fallen angels the duty of the ashkenazi jews

7334494 one of humanitys great achievements is in fact overcoming racism
7334495 helping civil society to overcome any possible temptation to racism intolerance and exclusion
7334496 molim vas ne zanima me sta radite u svojoj radnji da li cerupate pilice secirate golubove izvodite rituale ali necu dozvoliti da se bahato ponasate prema satu koji sam ostavio kod vas na popravci ipak je to sat koji je prosao dva svetska rata na ruci moga oca otac ga redovno cisti i brine se o njemu nije moja stvar ali trebalo bi da dovedete radnju u red
7334497 pazite molim vas da ne ugazite u krv ne skida se lako

7334507 sad cemo da sacekamo sledeci tramvaj i da te gurnemo pod njega
7334508 a deep spirituality centered in bible study worship and prayer
7334509 is more about the christian way of life than it is about a rigid and polemicized systems of belief
7334510 once you throw off biblical doctrine what do you have to guide you this is to me a reflection of what satan did with eve in the garden this is genesis 3 1 yea hath god said in other words if you undermine what god had said then what have you got
7334511 well youve got proverbs 14 12 theres a way that seems right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death or destruction
7334512 join humbly and charitably with people of other faiths muslim hindu buddhist jewish secularists and others in pursuit of peace environmental stewardship
7334513 and thats what people of the world people of faith desperately need
7334514 porqu yo eso tiene que redacta la secretaria de actas mi mam es tesorera m s bien puedo hacer la rendici n de cuentas
7334515 cristina por favor abre los ojos y viaja nunca m s habr otra oportunidad para ti
7334516 porque supuestamente yo no entregu las donaciones que hab a tra do
7334517 cristina no les digas nada por favor espera que las cosas se arreglen
7334518 el lago nos protege el sol da calor la luna me da alegr a y el rayo me da temor
7334519 my spirit guides jesus and mamacita where with me teaching me to overcome the lower spiritual entities
7334520 false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive if possible even the elect but take heed
7334521 the woman was standing in the back of the room when the faith of god hit the meeting and her tumor exploded out of her right leg slid down her leg onto the floor
7334522 and there is this older lady worshipping right in front of the platform and the holy spirit spoke to me the gift of faith came on me he said kick her in the face with your biker boot i went like this kicks and shouts bam and just as my boot made contact with her nose she fell under the power of god
7334523 the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests rule by their own power and my people love to have it so
7334524 and when i first got saved the demonic started showing up unlike anything that i had seen even before i became a christian i came out of everything involved with the demonic especially in the whole world of music and satanic music
7334525 the coming of the lawless one is according to the working of satan with all power signs and lying wonders and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish because they did not receive the love of the truth
7334526 she was beautiful with flowing hair and robes of shimmering dark blue spangled with tiny stars
7334527 m iracles continue tumors disappearing nightly cancers and deaf ears being healed it has been reported that more than 55 people in wheelchairs are receiving their healing another remarkable turn of events 13 reported resurrections
7334528 i get the ability to diagnose peoples sicknesses with my left hand i get very accurate details from god and whenever this angel shows up the miracles go off the charts
7334529 t hey pick this thing up and they stuck it in me right here on my neck and it didnt hurt
7334530 in a single violent motion he plunged it into perrys skull
7334531 take a glass of pure water go out to the balcony raise it high in your right hands and say may the most precious blood of our lord jesus christ which when only represented in egypt brought freedom to the israelites by the strong arm of god free us and favor us against all evil sun and earth moon and stars mosses reptiles i ask of you this day the health of this patient
7334532 many of our churches are in serious danger of occult contamination
7334533 that first week in college when the gospel was shared with me i welcomed it with open arms
7334534 but i did not understand the importance of carefully systematically studying his word
7334535 soon my logic told me the bible was too narrow
7334536 no ill write it and you work on the music
7334537 lisa i am very sorry to say youre single no more as i have spoken to your daddy therefore i would like to marry you
7334538 the cards were going everywhere and i was trying to take it in
7334539 its gonna be a very emotional day for me theres no point putting any make up on if im gonna keep crying
7334540 seg n datos preliminares de las 90 personas que hab a a bordo solo 20 sobrevivieron y fueron hospitalizadas
7334541 im sensing that we are on the verge of a casual games backlash
7334542 the space is so ridiculously over funded the barriers to entry are so low and the media models require such high traffic to generate meaningful revenue that i think there has to be a shake out i think the sites with traffic like miniclip will benefit because everybody is going to be buying referrals from them
7334543 i read a recent analyst report that showed almost 90 mmos virtual worlds and online game services scheduled to come to market in the next 18 months
7334544 going to benefit the platform companies weve been seeing tremendous customer growth at vivox for example which provides high quality voice services to online games
7334545 im increasingly interested in more gamer oriented online games not based on subscription billing models our investment in riot games grew out of this thinking weve seen strong evidence that this combination works in the chinese and korean markets but its been slow to take off here it is going to take the right game to unlock this market but it could be huge
7334546 free to play gaming and virtual worlds monetized through up sold virtual goods and subscriptions are gaining increasing traction in the west
7334547 companies like k2 runescape jagex gameforge eve ccp and bigpoint all doing revenues now in the tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars but gaming like media is not a winner take all business and there are many up and coming companies building free to play experiences and growing fast
7334548 w ith the death of retail and the greater accessibility of games in the hands of an order of magnitude larger audience
7334549 free to play with some premium components becomes the most logical conclusion then of course with alternate billing models comes alternate payment systems
7334550 we are still at the cusp of a sea change in the gaming space that rivals that of web 1 0 in scope
7334551 in part due to the rapid adoption of social networks as an entertainment platform
7334552 social relationships as primary catalysts for game playing were moving back to the playground where games reinforce and create social bonds
7334553 its tight not that many people are there though there arent that many people in my school
7334554 well the gas prices you know i wana go places but i cant my mom cant drive me its too expensive i have to catch the bus or the lightrail but theyve cleaned the lightrail up a lot now thats more expensive and the taxes those are real expensive too
7334555 der er flere ting p spil hvis den kvindelige helt er truet er det kun fordi hun har haft s stor succes at folk tr nger til at se noget nyt
7334556 super bitches and action babes the female hero in popular cinema 1970 2006
7334557 nu har vi set at de kvindelige helte er lige st st rke og kloge som m ndene eller st rkere og klogere end m ndene og n r en genre har v ret meget popul r en periode som kvindeactionfilmene har de sidste 12 r er det naturligt at der opst r en tr thed omkring det

7334642 i just woke up very very early yesterday before 5am yesterday and i had the spasm in my neck
7334643 fortunately ive got a great doctor who was with me the whole way through it

7334645 fortunately as i said i have a great trainer who helped pedro de la rosa was looking forward to racing
7334646 no it wont be a problem again im pretty sure
7334647 its still sore it was probably something to do with my pillow the way i was sleeping because it was just when i woke up
7334648 when the story of the season is written this game wont warrant too many lines it was however our fifth straight win in this stadium and enough to remain as early leaders
7334649 chelsea yet again paced themselves beautifully to stay in step with manchester united

7334659 est n viendo c mo se congraciar n con el poder local y eso genera un clima de inseguridad jur dica y eso no favorece a los pobres

7334661 la administraci n de justicia es una de las instancias que m s violo los derechos humanos
7334662 para el observatorio de los derechos humanos es cierto que la persona tiene influencia poder econ mico y pol tico siempre salen bien salvados de cualquier hecho que hayan cometido en eso la justicia tiene que ser imparcial y tiene que mostrar un nuevo rostro y los bolivianos tengan confianza en el poder judicial
7334663 la administraci n de justicia por diferentes razones de orden pol tico ideol gico que defienden intereses de poder fue muy venida a menos

7334678 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
7334679 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
7334680 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
7334681 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable
7334682 we are stuck in relationships in which major powers are not enemies but not friends

7334726 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7334727 the key thing is for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids where school attendance is a real problem
7334728 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7334729 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in
7334730 its part of our approach of mutual responsibility and we think it is an important way to go because its those kids who miss out from regular school attendance who are going to be the most vulnerable across the entire country
7334731 i couldnt handle it with the people up there i had to be alone for awhile

7334734 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7334735 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7334736 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7334737 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7334738 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about childcare and figure out how to start a college fund for their kids

7334742 under stv all of the votes are used there are no wasted votes
7334743 deciding which electoral system is best for your community may come down to deciding which is more important process or outcome
7334744 in a nutshell stv is where you rank candidates in your order of preference 1 2 3 and so on and fpp is where you place a tick beside your preferred candidates
7334745 the perceived view is that the real advantage of fpp is that it is a lot easier to understand
7334746 in my view it is not difficult to vote under the stv system its the counting of the votes that is complicated but people shouldnt worry too much about that

7334784 i was 21 years young when that happened and yet i remember it like yesterday i have pondered it since it happened and even more so with the current warmongers in dc and elsewhere and especially since my children have come along why cant the peoples make an unarmed peace
7334785 id like to be optimistic but i see very little today that offers much encouragement
7334786 we played an extra batsman in this game and i thought we were 15 to 20 runs short because you need that extra when your part time bowlers get hit for runs
7334787 it was a good track to bat on there wasnt much for the bowlers although the new ball did a bit and zaheer and praveen bowled really well they helped us maintain the pressure
7334788 but in the end sri lanka got that partnership and then it went right down to the wire
7334789 we made a few mistakes upfront while batting and that cost us the game
7334790 the ball spun a bit towards the end but it was a good wicket to bat on
7334791 the new ball does tend to do a bit under lights but once you get through that batting is a lot more easy
7334792 i think it was a gettable target but we probably leaked a few runs because we attacked a bit at the start
7334793 i like politics but its not something im going to jump in anytime soon
7334794 aspires to become a local hub for richmonds growing edible gardening community
7334795 sixty five passengers were killed 22 injured and three are missing
7334796 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7334797 we dont have any concrete information on the kidnappers or where they have been taken but we are trying to find out how they are
7334798 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7334799 the key thing is for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids where school attendance is a real problem
7334800 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7334801 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in
7334802 helped australian democracy it stopped packer getting control of fairfax
7334803 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7334804 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7334805 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7334806 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7334807 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7334808 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about childcare and figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7334809 so what are you expecting from obama if hes in office not that the other puppet is better
7334810 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7334811 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7334812 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7334813 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7334814 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7334815 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7334816 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7334817 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7334818 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7334819 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7334820 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours

7334828 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly

7334831 all of the sudden grains are starting to have to pave their own way
7334832 when someone is carrying credit card debt it means they are falling behind instead of getting ahead when people ask how much credit card debt is ok its a little like asking how much dynamite can you keep in the basement you probably could keep some and get along ok but the smartest move is not to keep any

7334837 left up could be turning lights on right down could be turning off the tv
7334838 you could control not just your chair your tv your computer but your entire life
7334839 i am not sure what was wrong with it i haven t been on in 4 days and i received a lot of messages about it being broken it seems to be working
7334840 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7334841 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7334842 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7334843 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7334844 i have no resentment against arabs who come to kurdistan as workers or tourists
7334845 we want kurdistan to be the tourist destination for arabs who will pump money into our economy

7334848 i have no resentment against arabs who come to kurdistan as workers or tourists

7334852 hes totally different than any other mayor of birmingham ive ever seen
7334853 most of the previous mayors have been conservative in their style like business people trying to govern a corporate entity his erratic style just doesnt fit
7334854 this city has all the potential in the world its time to do something in this town
7334855 hes a good promoter but you have to act on facts
7334856 hes doing a great job hes willing to do the things to put together a plan to move this city forward

7334874 we hebben zeker potentieel voor de spelen van 2012 in londen
7334875 we moeten het de jongeren mogelijk maken om hun geliefde sport uit te oefenen terwijl ze ook hun studies kunnen voortzetten op schoolniveau kunnen we zeker nog vorderingen maken

7334879 construction is a high risk industry and the use of swing stage scaffolds is dangerous if theyre not properly erected
7334880 we dont pass any particular judgment on this circumstance but we will be investigating the use of swing stage scaffolds
7334881 yesterdays fatalities were the first in memory that was a double fatality and its certainly a wake up call for us
7334882 we want manslaughter charges for the employers and the directors of these companies that are blatantly at fault
7334883 we want them charged we want them locked up because there are murderers out there
7334884 a few blocks from here there has just been a terrible industrial accident where we have seen two construction workers lose their lives
7334885 none of us are thinking straight at the moment it is still a nightmare we are going through and its still a blank
7334886 at the moment she is comfortable and we have not really spoken to her about it ive not spoken to anybody properly about what happened
7334887 my daughter heard screaming and crying and i went out
7334888 jade was crying for her mum and i tried to comfort her she was conscious throughout and responding as i spoke to her
7334889 im a care worker now but ive worked in a amp e and i have never seen breaks like that i feared she would lose her legs and said so to a colleague ive been to see her in hospital and spoken to her but i dont know if the full impact of what happened to her has sunk in

7334891 i will only be happy if they get substantial convictions
7334892 it will always be somewhere in the back of his mind and im sure it takes part in some of his dreams
7334893 it was a terrible thing to happen that should never have happened
7334894 if we call our case we lose that last kick at the cat opportunity as well
7334895 by not calling evidence the crown has to draw all the strings together and try and come up with a common thread and then we have an opportunity to hear the entirety of that argument before we make ours
7334896 in general theres a circumstantial body of evidence that the crown is going to rely on and suggest that it is sufficient to prove his involvement
7334897 obviously the man was kidnapped its a question of who did it or if you will what involvement they had
7334898 i might have something to say after the verdict but not now
7334899 our job is going to be to say when you look at the evidence carefully that actually isnt what occurred
7334900 basically the law on circumstantial evidence is such that if theres other reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence the judge is obliged to consider those
7334901 its all stuff that can be dealt with by way of argument because if there are other inferences that can be drawn he silverman is obliged to consider them
7334902 hes so experienced as a former criminal defence lawyer himself that he is capable of doing that
7334903 if it was a jury trial it would have been substantially different
7334904 for these guys that means getting up at five oclock in the morning getting shipped in

7334912 the agenda included domestic and international climate change policy low carbon fuels and biofuels
7334913 the minister took their views into consideration the government is proceeding with its turning the corner plan
7334914 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7334915 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7334916 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7334917 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7334918 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7334919 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7334920 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7334921 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7334922 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him

7334935 london will be the city of the country that has invented modern sport and has invented the rules of sport and has brought in the values of fair play
7334936 we continue to face a difficult economic environment in the united states with construction falling more than originally anticipated
7334937 we now expect ebitda for 2008 of about 5 3 billion
7334938 we now expect domestic cement volume in the united states to decrease by around 12 percent ready mix volume to decrease by about 21 percent and aggregates volumes to decrease by around 20 percent for the full year 2008
7334939 this was lower than we expected and a little worrying given that spain is one of cemexs top markets
7334940 we are very pleased to be building a cement plant together with sagar cements this operation results from methodical and determined efforts on the indian market decided by the chairman of vicat jacques merceron vicat it illustrates the international expansion strategy pursued by the vicat group which aims to expand its presence in high potential markets with very high quality partners we are confident about the growth momentum of our markets in asia and india and in vicats ability to fully leverage it
7334941 we are delighted to partner with vicat which is a highly respected global cement group this transaction gives us the opportunity to expand our scale and size and consequently strengthen our competitive position we also look forward to leverage on vicats high degree of experience and expertise especially in fields like waste fuel and product development the interest shown by vicat is testimony to our capabilities and operations which we have continuously endeavoured to optimise
7334942 validated our suspicions about what happened there was nothing surprising in it
7334943 were building a case and anticipate at some point well file seeking damages
7334944 shanshui cement should price at a discount to its peers because its peers tumbled recently following the plunge in the market

7334946 in the 1990s the gazan fishing industry produced an annual income of around 5m that had halved by 2007 and is still shrinking fast under the oslo accords which in 1993 were supposed to herald the coming of an independent palestinian state gazan fishermen were to be allowed 20 nautical miles out to sea where they could catch sardine as they migrated from the nile delta up towards turkey during the spring but israeli naval ships in recent years have imposed their own much reduced limits sometimes less than 6 miles out
7334947 what gives israel the right to take away the livelihood of these fishermen and why does the world allow them to destroy an industry that used to provide for thousands of palestinians
7334948 we intend to challenge that right backed up by warships and machine guns just as we challenged israels right to prevent us from coming here on saturday

7335039 the active participation of the faithful has been encouraged in the of however this must not mean that mass is to be entirely dialogue oriented mass must have moments of silence of inwardness and personal prayer where there is
7335040 man cannot be deeply penetrated by mystery we are not to talk uninterruptedly before god but to also let him speak
7335041 goodbye to all thank you for helping me get to the olympics remember the good times and keep loving shooting avianna
7335042 i dont think theres any defence for sport shooters anymore its a hobby that creates danger to others
7335043 the clubs closing changes nothing what happens to us has no impact on crime in the streets
7335044 its much easier for the mayor to shut us down than it is to deal with the real problem
7335045 the real problem in the city is the gun culture among the gangs
7335046 i have a 92 year old luger that i have never been able to hit the paper with jenny can cut the centre out of the target with the damn thing
7335047 it is a constant challenge against yourself you have to get yourself in a very calm state
7335048 well it just scared the living hell out of me
7335049 theyre not that old for crying out loud theyre only from the eighties
7335050 they always thought i was a nice old guy but i was asking them pointed questions

7335054 when an obstetrician sets out to convince a pregnant woman to consent to an induction he is almost always successful
7335055 so when the doctor suggests induction the idea is appealing to the woman because it appears to end a dangerous situation for the baby remaining in the womb
7335056 yet in the united states we are inducing labor in more than 40 percent of all pregnancies
7335057 offer the sacrifices of righteousness and trust in the lord
7335058 yeah they look good on paper but theyll blow it
7335059 thou my great father i thy true son thou in me dwelling and i with thee one
7335060 mother and father you are both to me now and forever your child i will be
7335061 no one who really sees the lord can remain the same
7335062 are you nuts if i become a church member you will chain me to the toilet to clean it with my hair
7335063 men who know their god are before anything else men who pray and the first point where their zeal and energy for gods glory come to expression is in their prayers
7335064 2in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of jerusalem 3and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes
7335065 prayer implies providence for if god hath not a present means of influencing the course of natural events it is a waste of breath to petition for his intervention
7335066 pero boludaaaaa es la forma en que cont s las cosas lo que causa gracia ten s que escribir un libro te com s los peores garrones y aun as te las arregl s para ponerle humor
7335067 bueno tanto como escribir un libro no porque no puedo escribir ni mi nombre en un cup n de un sorteo pero por ah si cuento las cosas que me pasan alguien m s se puede sentir identificada
7335068 o soy yo que soy un radiador que se me pegan todos los bichos o esto es algo que realmente est pasando a nivel social
7335069 a ver si hay mujeres que se sienten identificadas con esto entonces estamos ante un fen meno social

7335074 relatively careful to make sure you understand that hes not a quote unquote new democrat but he also makes clear hes not an old democrat
7335075 youre going to see greater federal activism because there will be the expectation that he reacts to the countrys problems and finds answers to them
7335076 if he doesnt the democrats will be out on their ear from congress
7335077 during the course of the campaign and debates what people have to find out is wheres his bottom line
7335078 obamas all about change and compromise but in washington the first lesson you learn is you can only compromise from strength strength means that people know what you stand for thats what he has to define before the republicans do
7335079 what are the four or five goals that they plan to accomplish
7335080 by and large the conservatives shaped politics for a generation
7335081 now theyre out of answers so theres this ripe moment and we need to fill that moment
7335082 having an infrastructure independent of the party arms the activists
7335083 when theyre at their neighborhood barbecue theyll have answers when someone claims that say obama is muslim
7335084 if you ask whats distinctive about obama i would say it has much more to do with leadership style and generational appeal than it does with a clear departure either doctrinally or programmatically

7335086 i introduced this measure with the aim of preventing another catastrophic fish kill like the one that took place on prospect island last year to protect our states declining fisheries and the commercial and sport fishing industries those fisheries support
7335087 todays vote takes us a step closer to that goal discussion on this issue and the broader effort to save the delta and its fisheries continues to move forward i hope that the fishing community will continue to actively participate in the conversation and thank them for their support in this effort
7335088 it addresses part of the problem stopping a repeat of the horrendous fish kill that occurred at prospect island last year
7335089 however the amended bill does nothing to mitigate the impacts of the state and federal water projects as well as proposals to modify the hydrology of the delta on chinook salmon steelhead delta smelt striped bass and other fish
7335090 the fishing community should be indebted for wolks efforts on behalf of california fisheries unfortunately the fishing community was not able to overcome the scorched earth style opposition of the hydraulic brotherhood to consider mitigation for the damage they have caused to delta fisheries
7335091 the death of tens of thousands of fish including striped bass and other sportfish could have been prevented with some basic planning this bill is a strong first step towards preventing further losses to our states fisheries
7335092 the fishing community is disappointed that the badly needed mitigation provisions of the bill didnt pass
7335093 however we are pleased that ab 1806 will help coordinate and plan fish rescues in the future so a tragic disaster like the prospect island fish kill wont occur again
7335094 we need to do everything we can in the future to pass a bill that will hold the water contractors and agencies accountable for the damages theyve caused to our fisheries
7335095 the state and federal agencies are responsible for restoring delta fisheries and the ecosystem for too long fishermen and others have been disenfranchised by the agencies that are supposed to uphold the public trust
7335096 whether youre from the burgh or not you have to respect khalifas skills his flow is smooth and his timing is great unfortunately this song will never be a true hit outside of western pa for the pure fact that there is a national bias against our region its a shame that talentless hacks like lil wayne and soulja boy hit it big because of trendy dance moves all you haters better recognize the talent coming out of this city

7335117 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
7335118 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
7335119 an independent judiciary is in our interest and we are working for it and it is also imperative for democracy and rule of law
7335120 the way we have given surprise to nation with regard to pervez musharraf we will also give surprise about restoration of the judges

7335135 till now mendis was never under any pressure and was bowling at his best
7335136 you need to punish him if he bowls a bad ball if you continue to defend him he will always be on top
7335137 i had a different role when i started playing international cricket batting at a different slot we had players to play long innings but i was one of those to go out and accelerate and even if i got out it was okay there was a transformation and in the last two years ive been under a little pressure to be more responsible thats what im doing and ive got a strike rate of nearly 90

7335140 shell also discuss the current political scene as we head toward the presidential nominating conventions
7335141 for years automakers have been criticized for producing vehicles that get so so gas mileage but as gas prices climb and consumers seek more miles per gallon it turns out that fuel economy is much worse than it
7335142 they would have likely survived the crash if they had been restrained
7335143 some of the folks need professional development training on the front end
7335144 this was sentencing day and we have to come back another time while he thinks about it
7335145 in 2003 the government owned ntpc floated a tender asking for potential suppliers of 12 mmscmd of natural gas for its proposed power plants at kawas and gandhar for a period of 17 years
7335146 since the ntpc deal happened at around the same time in early 2004 it was agreed that ril would supply 28 mmscmd of gas to reliance energys 7 480 mw dadri power plant on the same commercial terms at ntpc at that time the reliance empire had not been divided when the family split took place this was put into the family agreement which was ratified by rils 2 mn shareholders as well as by the court
7335147 ril appealed this and one of the arguments being made is that the family settlement was signed by mukesh as a member of the ambani family and not by ril
7335148 such is the state of the governments support to ntpc that while anil ambani has got a stay preventing ril from selling what he says is his share of the gas and has won one round in court the ntpc case is proceeding at a snails pace

7335152 if a war were to happen as they are threatening our victory this time will be decisive unquestionable and final
7335153 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
7335154 there are currently elections within kadima israels ruling political party and each candidate is trying to portray himself as the leader and the saviour
7335155 the five units will be destroyed in our mountains and valleys and homes and villages
7335156 and with it will be destroyed your country that is violating our sacred land
7335157 if a war were to happen as they are threatening our victory this time will be decisive unquestionable and final

7335165 thousands of california children are likely to lose health insurance coverage they now have
7335166 i know the state has made a concerted effort to cover children but even in that it ranks 42nd
7335167 we continue to do outreach we continue to enroll kids at a rapid rate
7335168 at the scene of every crime for numerous questionable elections since 2000
7335169 works for credit card companies chasing data thieves identity thieves around the globe and also consults with government agencies including the secret service the pentagon and the federal bureau of investigation in criminal matters hes really one of the top and in fact the top private cop in the world on the subject of data security
7335170 refuse s to show the architecture of their voting machines or allow it to be exposed to any kind of significant expert
7335171 the people who they claim have certified their machines have no knowledge of architecture whatsoever
7335172 the fundamental structures that diebold has used to set up their voting machines are inherently flawed they are what i would consider it junk
7335173 those people the people who check a banks atm are not from diebold one of them is from the installation group and one of them is from the bank otherwise the atm machine is not certified for use
7335174 so what youre saying is theres more security regarding the dispensing of a 20 bill and the fact that if you dont get that 20 bill there is more of an audit system set up as compared to any audit system for the counting of our votes
7335175 there is a very strong argument to be made that the 2000 election was electronically stolen the hanging chads were just a distraction
7335176 warning that the way diebold systems are architected in the way the tabulators communicate to the central state tabulation center is subject to foreign national hacking as well as hacking from within the u s they put out a warning about it to the best of my knowledge this is still the case
7335177 if you look at the case of saxby chambliss thats ridiculous the man was not elected he lost that election by five points max cleland won they flipped the votes clear as day
7335178 i do not believe george bush won in 2004 i believe kerry won and im a member of the gop but i want to make it clear we need to live in a place where your a candidates election actually is reflected in the vote i want my candidate to win but if my candidate loses i care a lot more about the process than i care about the victory
7335179 ive personally reviewed a number of pieces of code from diebold its garbage some of the code is awful i reviewed the patch that they put in georgia 2002 that many of them claimed is a clock function its not a clock function its a comparator function if it were me and i were to guess what that code is its a vote flipping code its not a clock function that i know
7335180 there are people out there and there is sic a lot of them who dont really want to win elections what they want to do is they want to steal them i dont want to have a society where were not sure who won i want to live in a democracy where there is a valid capacity to audit the entire trail
7335181 i think they the diebold machines are brilliantly designed theyre designed to steal elections there are back doors in the tabulations machines which is what the us cert warning is about theres a backdoor communication that allows secondary computers to talk to the actual tabulators electronically from a distance
7335182 wat een land jullie zijn een volk van gemeentereinigers en opschrijvers

7335187 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7335188 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7335189 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7335190 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7335195 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir
7335196 casi me caigo de la silla observar su esfuerzo con las palabras y la memoria no pod a creerlo ella ten a 75 a os pero siempre pensaba que era una persona que no envejec a sin tiempo y ciento por ciento de hierro
7335197 el contraste se ala fue a n m s sorprendente porque hasta ese momento su memoria era siempre como la web
7335198 he tenido que aprender a tener paciencia una cualidad que admito no es abundante tambi n he tenido que aprender que ten a una enfermedad y que no era nada personal
7335199 hes getting some contact that green jersey is supposed to keep you from having to strike anybody or have someone strike you but when you get the ball in your hand you tend to get shots i think hes getting plenty right now
7335200 chris davis has done a nice job at center and ben jones has certainly been competing ben is doing well strickland has come a long way but the two guys who have been the most solid inside have been vince vance and chris kiante tripp and trinton sturdivant were getting very solid and we were getting very comfortable where they were and now with trinton out weve had to disrupt tripp at the right tackle were moving him to left tackle and by doing that we moved josh davis from the left to the right its just different new techniques and you lose that guy working side by side that is so much a part of that line play
7335201 it was a good move for us were thankful weve got him over there now hes helping us still be pretty solid at the tackle position and as he gets better hell be more than just solid without him here right now wed be spinning pretty hard right now
7335202 the only thing thats going to hold josh back a little bit is the strength issue and hes improved tremendously hes still not as far as youd like him but hes making great progress in that area what he is lacking there hes been making up for it with knowledge effort and tenacity
7335203 i ran the 200 and 120 meters my junior year in high school when i got to college i wanted to run but my priority was football and taking care of school track kind of eased away but any chance i get to watch the olympics its amazing i record everything i just like seeing people run thats just me i even ran against walter dix in high school its kind of amazing seeing somebody i ran against in high school now running in the olympics and doing as good a job as hes doing my signature race is coming up the 200 meters what usain bolt did in the 100 meters times that in the 200 its going to be incredible hes probably a couple of months older than me im 20 hes 21 and for him to be running that fast i was wondering what theyre doing over there in jamaica i even love the gymnastics tennis the swimming with michael phelps i know ryan lochte when to sports creek one of the schools down in daytona so i used to get to watch him swim
7335204 were both talented just because hes injured doesnt mean i have a leg up on him when he comes back if he comes back 100 percent hes still the same so were still both on the same playing field
7335205 as far as switching position from d end to offensive line and then from one positition on offensive line to another yeah i can relate with him because of course i did the same thing as far as him being over at left tackle kiante is athletic as crap so i feel comfortable with coach searels decision
7335206 i was a freshman coming out of high school and i was only like 260 so i felt like i still had the speed to be a d end and i just loved playing d end so of course i didnt agree with it but it all worked out for the best
7335207 its all about him honestly i could tell him ive got the long field goal but its really up to him hell know my yardage even probably better than i do but thats something that comes with seniority i wouldnt step up there and say coach ive got it from this far its a privilege to have the faith in you to do that youve got to earn that
7335208 i just zone out the adrenaline starts pumping i dont hear the fans i focus on brians hands the entire time and as soon as that ball goes my left foot goes my whole goal is just to hit it straight and get it up thats it
7335209 its like hot and cold hes a young guy learning the defense for every good play he makes a bad play but hes got the ability
7335210 its very important for our front four to put pressure any time you can generate pressure without blitzing the more you can do that the more opportunity you have to be successful everybody puts pressure on offense when you blitz but you cant do that all the time these offenses are very very good theres a lot of things you need to defend and youre really taking a risk factor when you take that shot
7335211 i think with richard and dontavius having the opportunity to come in as a midyear has certainly helped them not that its put them ahead of carlton thomas in any way because carlton thomas has done a pretty good job of learning what to do but id say richard coming in midyear has really helped him learn the system mature and understand what its going to take to be game ready id say hes put himself in position
7335212 we certainly want to feel like if were going to play them on special teams theyre going to be able to give us quality reps as an offensive player also we just dont want to burn a year just to bring a kickoff return back so weve got to feel like they can help us on offense
7335213 i think weve got a chance to be pretty explosive both running the ball and throwing it weve got guys back there that can really make plays running the football if we can open up some holes which i know we can and if we protect i think weve got a chance to run by some people and maybe be a little more explosive than we were last year
7335214 i think their addition to the team is especially good you get to see things from a young perspective and it kind of rejuvenates you and makes you want to go out there its kind of like when youre competing with your older brother or younger brother the older brother always wants to do better than the younger brother green pushes me to do things i learn from him as much as he learns from me
7335215 i think im close but ive got a lot more to work on sometimes it gets sore so ive got to work on my flexibility and get stronger i think ron courson and the staff have done a good job of putting me through a program i need to get better

7335221 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7335222 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7335223 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7335224 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7335225 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7335226 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7335227 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7335228 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7335229 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7335230 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7335231 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7335232 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7335233 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7335234 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7335235 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7335236 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7335237 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7335238 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7335239 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7335240 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit
7335241 may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7335242 make me absolutely convinced he is the right man for the job
7335243 he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships
7335244 he and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids
7335245 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
7335246 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
7335247 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music
7335248 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control
7335249 ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now
7335250 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7335251 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7335252 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7335253 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7335254 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7335255 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7335256 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7335257 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7335258 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7335259 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7335260 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7335261 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7335262 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7335263 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7335264 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7335265 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7335266 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7335267 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7335268 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7335269 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7335270 i think obama can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7335271 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7335272 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been destroyed and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elderly people have died
7335273 they have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it
7335274 so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7335275 once again the enemies of islam have stained their hands with the blood of innocent people we the muslim nation will not accept their apologies this time
7335276 we regret the loss of life among the innocent afghans who we are committed to protect
7335277 the concern is that the government and international community will lose the credibility of the afghan people
7335278 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7335279 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7335280 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7335281 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7335282 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7335283 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7335284 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7335285 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7335286 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7335287 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7335288 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7335289 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7335290 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7335291 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7335292 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7335293 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7335294 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7335295 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7335296 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7335297 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7335298 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7335299 hoy por la ma ana recibi una llamada era mi madre su voz se escuchaba entrecortada por el llanto
7335300 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7335301 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7335302 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7335303 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7335304 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7335305 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7335306 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7335307 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7335308 who are open to doing something on the production side
7335309 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7335310 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7335311 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7335312 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7335313 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7335314 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7335315 there is anger among senior government sources and the mayors inner circle
7335316 it is a total disgrace this proud night for britain has been sullied by this grotesque representation of london
7335317 clearly whoever was responsible must be found and fired immediately
7335318 when were speaking with the government were speaking about everything from environmental issue that affect our business to energy supply within canada and abroad as well as capital and jobs and economic impact
7335319 when youre asking did we speak about the oil sands i think yes we would definitely have been speaking about the oil sands and our business
7335320 these kinds of meetings and exchanges happen all the time
7335321 the agenda included domestic and international climate change policy low carbon fuels and biofuels
7335322 the minister took their views into consideration the government is proceeding with its turning the corner plan
7335323 sound like they are designed to keep us from feeding kids

7335330 to have ups to have downs to go through everything and be able to accomplish everything you have ever really dreamed of it is fun
7335331 it is about being an athlete and bringing the most you can to the table whether you are the strongest or fastest that is what we believe going into it
7335332 you go from having a love of the sport to competing and feeling pressure and getting older i feel like i have almost gone back around the other half of it in getting back to that primal joy
7335333 its notable that suddenly with output rising opec officials are concerned about adherence to quotas and oversupply
7335334 to hold high u s officials accountable in courts of law and if guilt is found to obtain appropriate punishments otherwise
7335335 the future will be threatened by additional examples of executive lawlessness by leaders who need fear no personal consequences
7335336 the possibility of more viet nams more iraqs and more repression
7335337 this is intended to be a planning conference one at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures will be set up to seek prosecutions to determine guilt and if guilt is found appropriate punishments
7335338 the common sense of mankind demands that law shall not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people it must also reach men who possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched

7335424 decid seguir por el camino de la responsabilidad en esos momentos porque pens que no conven a al club entrar en una espiral pens que hab a que tomar decisiones de reestructuraci n de las plantillas y por tanto entiendo que en ese momento tuvimos sentido de la responsabilidad

7335433 el laboratorio de drogas que se logr desbaratar en ingeniero maschwitz propiedad de mexicanos fue un golpe importante pero apenas la punta del iceberg de un fen meno lamentable ya instalado en el pa s
7335434 por el tipo de instalaciones que encontraron en la argentina la edad y la procedencia de todos los mexicanos detenidos all y por el destino de los cargamentos de efedrina contrabandeada desde buenos aires quien est instalado en la argentina es el cartel de sinaloa
7335435 para nosotros no es una sorpresa que el cartel de sinaloa llegue a buenos aires en la argentina seguramente hay una fiebre de autorizaciones legales que est n permitiendo el ingreso de sustancias que en un amplio porcentaje no est n destinados a la industria de los medicamentos
7335436 el gobierno es consciente de lo que est pasando nosotros le pedimos una reuni n al embajador de los estados unidos earl wayne y hablamos con tony grecco el representante de la dea para que aporten informaci n

7335452 the virgin success story is based on richards ability to inspire his staff to have the same sense of ownership and entrepreneurial spirit that he has
7335453 to truly succeed in the airline service game you need thousands of staff to act as though its their own business said huttner who spent a decade as a virgin group airline executive and was the founding commercial chief of virgin blue in australia
7335454 virgin has done that kingfishers success will depend on doing the same
7335455 we will set new standards our customers are our guests not passengers this is reflected in comforts provided on board together with the hospitality offered by a hand picked trained crew

7335457 we have not seen any protests or received any threats from any section this is mostly due to the precautions we have taken much before initiating the process of setting up the plant

7335489 there will be no significant material and economic progress in muslim communities until the muslim mind is allowed to challenge the status quo of muslim conventions and even their most cherished shibboleths
7335490 i dont believe there are moderate muslims because in islam you have to believe in every teaching as a holy teaching you cannot change you have to accept it the way it is because otherwise simply you are not a muslim
7335491 the koran remains for all muslims not just fundamentalists the uncreated word of god himself it is valid for all times and places its ideas are absolutely true and beyond all criticism to question it is to question the very word of god and hence blasphemous a muslims duty is to believe it and obey its divine commands

7335502 shared awareness that we are a family of nations a notion that pope john paul ii held up as an ideal at the general assembly of the united nations
7335503 even today we want to proclaim this with innermost conviction
7335504 yes jesus you are christ the son of the living god we are aware that christ is the true treasure for whom it is worth sacrificing all he is the friend who never abandons us for he knows the innermost expectations of our heart jesus is the son of the living god the promised messiah who came on earth to offer humanity salvation and satisfy the thirst for life and love that dwells in every human being what advantages would humanity get if it welcomed the announcement that brings with it joy and peace
7335505 it is the first time that jesus spoke about the church whose mission is to implement gods grandiose plan to unite in christ the whole of humanity as a single family
7335506 before the huge responsibility of this task i feel ever more the importance and the duty of serving the church and the world that god placed in me for this reason i call upon you dear brothers and sisters to help me with your prayers so that faithful to christ we can together announce and bear witness to his presence in our times may mary enable us to obtain this grace we call upon her full of trust as the mother of the church and the star of evangelization

7335556 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity

7335559 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7335560 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7335561 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7335562 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7335563 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7335564 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7335565 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7335566 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7335567 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7335568 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7335569 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7335570 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7335571 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7335572 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7335573 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7335574 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7335575 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7335576 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7335577 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7335578 try to use that word or those words more often
7335579 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7335580 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7335581 this is the best of times and the worst of times
7335582 there are so many other lives invested in this project than my own
7335583 i had to take some time off i knew that when i came back i had to be able to be 100 percent invested in what were doing and be fully present in the team
7335584 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7335585 he has played an incredibly special role for us he has helped guide and direct this team and im just so happy he was able to stick around and stick with us
7335586 a little piece of this was dedicated to them the fact that we could do this for them and ease the pain a little bit and bring a little bit of joy into their life in such a difficult time is something thats pretty special
7335587 this isnt any vindication this isnt anything thats going to alter any outcome but ill look upon that gold medal with a lot of satisfaction and then im going to mourn the loss of my father in law
7335588 you stay at home and wait for me ill buy supper back for you
7335589 youll hunt me youll condemn me set the dogs on me because thats what needs to happen
7335590 because hes the hero gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now and so well hunt him because he can take it because hes not a hero hes a silent guardian a watchful protector a dark knight
7335591 door niet te oordelen schep je stilte in je geest
7335592 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7335593 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7335594 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7335595 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7335596 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7335597 a business cant compete a student cant compete our workforce cant compete
7335598 theyre not the latest and greatest and they have their difficulties
7335599 why didnt we do something 10 years ago five years ago three years ago one year ago beats the heck out of me
7335600 its the most obvious thing that we would invest a small amount of money to get our kids not just the hardware but all the software all the visual curriculum and all the teacher development
7335601 people think were much more connected in terms of the internet highway than we are
7335602 my resources are there for lesson planning for sharing ideas and getting amazing curriculum
7335603 theyre not dazzled by doing this its just natural to them they do amazing things
7335604 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7335605 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7335606 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7335607 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7335608 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7335609 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7335610 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7335611 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7335612 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7335613 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7335614 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7335615 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7335616 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7335617 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7335618 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7335619 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7335620 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7335621 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7335622 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7335623 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7335624 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7335625 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7335626 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7335627 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7335628 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7335629 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7335630 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7335631 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7335632 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7335633 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7335634 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7335635 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7335636 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7335637 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7335638 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7335639 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7335640 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7335641 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7335642 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7335643 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7335644 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7335645 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7335646 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7335647 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7335648 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7335649 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7335650 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7335651 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7335652 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7335653 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7335654 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7335655 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7335656 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7335657 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7335658 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7335659 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7335660 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7335661 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7335662 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7335663 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7335664 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7335665 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7335666 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off
7335667 when that dreadful day comes the audience will be ready for it
7335668 the reason the finale of the last series worked so well is that it was top secret
7335669 it s a free country and people are entitled to say this is richard and judy going off into the dim antechamber of television but i would ask them whats the future digital or analogue of course we are going to get smaller audiences but this is the challenge of the moment
7335670 most people are desperate to be famous and would do anything
7335671 it appeals to the mentality of people who stop to watch after an accident
7335672 the wonderful thing about the olympics is seeing people become famous because they have talent what a lovely change
7335673 it is more fulfilling of course because it concerns talent the beatles didnt make it because of me but because of the songs they wrote
7335674 we have had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it
7335675 i wanted to stand up and say hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up it was a very unwise thing to say i was shocked
7335676 we work very closely with german tv and the german book publisher and we love all germans
7335677 i was driven to tell a certain kind of story about global consciousness and interconnectivity i asked can people with these powers find each other defeat evil and save the world it was important to have people in the show that werent just blonde haired blue eyed californians
7335678 our relationship with our audience is tenuous but they are passionate intense involved and yes obsessive

7335682 these old school games might not have the best graphics

7335686 well i was talking to 17 four and three star generals yesterday morning and they all told me torture is ineffective and asked me if i would use it because they didnt want me to

7335690 on defense everybody had to get to the ball on every single snap no matter where it was at
7335691 we had some pretty physical practices and scrimmages so that was a little different from last season
7335692 if we discover a desire within us that nothing in this world can satisfy also we should begin to wonder if perhaps we were created for another world
7335693 deep down inside you long for a cold hearted republican to lower taxes brutalize criminals and rule you like a king

7335727 the most painful and frustrating economic policy blunder of the past 50 years was the great inflation of the 1970s

7335729 they focused in on the betting even though the statute does not focus on the betting
7335730 the statute clearly says you cannot play any cards or dice in a house of gaming how do we know what a house of gaming is this was not a public place this was a residence that was not even if it was used to bet in was not a house of gaming it was a house to live in
7335731 they were talking about a high stakes poker game in there that is absolutely the most ridiculous statement ive heard in my life
7335732 we are excited to have so many of the worlds top players coming to the grand waldo casino in macau this year its a testament to the success of season 1 that champions such as chan joe hachem scotty nguyen men the master nguyen and barry greenstein are eager to compete on the felt during our second season were privileged to continue leading the growth of poker and poker culture in asia and expect local and regional player participation to at least double during this years events the pokerstars net appt is taking poker to a new level in asia pacific and when this macau tournament is broadcast on tv around the world we expect this growth to continue

7335741 the cleveland browns schedule in those all so important last games of the season is not setup for success either week 13 they play indianapolis 2007 2nd in passing yards 2nd in passing tds allowed in week 14 they get tennessee 2007 10th 14th and in week 15 they take on the much improved philadelphia defense 2007 18th 3rd if you are fortunate enough to play for a championship in week 16 however you will be sitting pretty as the browns take on cincinnatis terrible pass defense 7th in most yards allowed and 4th in most touchdowns allowed in 2007

7335754 we recognize that were two humble boats but what weve accomplished is to show that average people from around the world can mobilize to create change we do not have to stay silent in the face of injustice reaching gaza today there is such a sense of hope and hope is what mobilizes people everywhere
7335755 were the first ones in 41 years to enter gaza freely but we wont be the last we welcome the world to join us and see what were seeing

7335759 sport has become the unending unremitting search for perfection and never before have i seen so many silver medallists gutted at not winning gold
7335760 the funding system in britain was due to deliver results in 2012 it was not expected in 2008 there will be additional pressure to succeed in london
7335761 there are nine million tickets to sell for the london games and the british public will need to see early medals
7335762 i am satisfied that we are making progress but disappointed and frustrated about the medals that got away
7335763 four medals will clearly not be enough in london but i think i should be judged on more than a medal count i cant categorically promise that we will do better in london 2012 people werent exactly queuing up for the job when i took it on and ive given it my best shot there was a lot wrong when i arrived and i think there is a lot more right today
7335764 a big challenge over the next four years to lift itself among some of the formula one sports like sailing cycling and rowing
7335765 i think athletics will always be seen as the premier olympic sport because of the number of medals that are available
7335766 its a big ask for athletics but athletics needs to respond to that and i believe they will

7335768 the 24 year old woman remains in prince of wales hospital where she will undergo surgery tomorrow monday for glass wounds to her eye
7335769 the key thing is for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids where school attendance is a real problem
7335770 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7335771 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in
7335772 luis scola has a gold medal and kobe does not

7335774 its wonderful to be involved in promoting the worlds great sporting events whether it is boxers tennis players or for communities
7335775 we had a show to save a hospital for black people in cleveland in 1972 it was discrimination and division against the black community and we got muhammad ali to celebrate by bringing people together to constrict the lack of egalitarianism to its smallest form i come back and im trying to do the same thing symbolically reaching out in china to make things happen bringing black white yellow brown together under the same banner
7335776 by winning another gold in my home city in 2012
7335777 its going to be hard to say no to a million pounds
7335778 but with terrys help i could stay amateur and the majority of the boys in the squad feel the same
7335779 im going to have to face the music when i get back and answer these allegations
7335780 but if im going to go on for the next four years im not going to put up with the crap ive had over the last four
7335781 here in beijing weve produced a gold and two bronze from seven boxers a medal ratio that compares well with any other sport
7335782 i think my record against the top guys bar nadal is pretty good so whether im top five or not a lot of the other players think im one of the top players now and that for me is the most important thing
7335783 if you can go into a slam ranked five or six and people dont think youve got a chance of winning it then id rather go in ranked 12 or 13 and have the other guys think that youve got a shot at doing it
7335784 i dont think im ready to just breeze through a slam like a federer or a nadal
7335785 im sure there are going to be some tough matches along the way but sometimes the seeds go out early and there are some upsets and you just have to make the most of it
7335786 from the start i wanted to push my best but i had to save myself for the later stages of the race
7335787 in the heat it was difficult and the humidity made it harder but i was determined to finish strongly
7335788 in kenya we have many medals but im so happy to be the first kenyan to win an olympic marathon gold medal my next goal is to get the world record maybe next year

7335809 neither b c nor any individual health authority is alone in its challenge to recruit and retain the number of physicians required to meet the growing demand for medical care over the coming decades
7335810 because most physicians serving communities are private business people and do not work for ih recruitment was the responsibility of site level physicians alone however given recruitment challenges in todays market ih has developed a comprehensive approach to support communities in attracting physicians
7335811 research shows that more than 50 per cent of physicians would use the web to begin searching for new practice opportunities the new website ensures that the health authority is able to maximize web based marketing strategies in its efforts to address current physician supply challenges for communities throughout ih

7335815 our whole theme is we want to make a penguin fly so if you can imagine a penguin on his stomach with his flippers out stretched and a cape around his neck trying desperately to fly thats what our box will look like
7335816 we still have to get the chassis figured out and get a good steering and brake system going before we build the frame then we will cover the frame with a mold exterior of a penguin hopefully once its all airbrushed itll look pretty good and will run well

7335819 weve re branded our company so we thought it would be neat to give the artist community an outlet to paint
7335820 a lot of these people especially the graffiti artists dont really have anywhere to paint in the city so we thought this would be a great outlet for them as you can see we have kids and all sorts of people taking a stab at it
7335821 not at all we respect that the city is trying to get rid of graffiti but its not going to stop someone from being an artist and wanting to be an artist so this is a legal and safe way to do whatever you want on the side of a truck
7335822 ive always wanted to get some nozzles and try it out but i havent done any in spray paint this is the first one

7335827 they are the whole world to me and without their support it would have been difficult rather impossible for me to win the medal whenever i felt low they motivated me they kept telling me that i had the potential of winning an olympic medal and i did it
7335828 when i lost in the second round of the world championship in chicago last year and failed to earn a berth for the olympics i was very upset
7335829 but they told me that the world championship was not my target they said my ultimate aim was winning an olympic medal and i would definitely win it
7335830 when i saw vijender for the first time at the nis at a national camp my first impression was he did not look like a boxer he had a very childlike face but when i saw him practising i realised that he was an exceptionally talented boxer
7335831 i still remember the days at the nis he was very hardworking and sometimes used to practise thrice a day
7335832 just a week before the team left for beijing vijender got a scratch on his face during a practice bout with manoj
7335833 we singaporeans must ensure that kindness and graciousness becomes part of our nature some examples of courtesy and kindness in our daily life are greeting one another giving way in crowded public spaces and showing consideration for others the responsibility falls on each and every one of us if you find your neighbours are distant and unfriendly do something about it be the first to greet them when you meet in the lift lobby or elsewhere do not be discouraged if they do not respond immediately repeat your warm and friendly overtures in future meetings make the effort to bring a smile and greetings to their lips if you make just one more friend as a result you would have succeeded your new friend will come to realise that it takes very little to make someones day and will in turn be inspired to perform little acts of courtesy and kindness toward others you could be starting a chain reaction to warm up your neighbourhood and make friends out of strangers
7335834 be the change you want to see in the world
7335835 words of kindness looks of sympathy expressions of appreciation and a helpful attitude would be to many a harassed citizen as a cup of cool water to a thirsty soul courtesy as a habit makes other people feel better
7335836 so far our application aggrogator allows a user to mash up several popular web services and create an aggregate feed of those services now to make things a little more interesting we want to allow users to subscribe to other users feeds where each users feed is quite possibly an aggregate of feeds itself for example lets say we want to set up an account to subscribe to ourself on twitter last fm and del icio us so friends can then subscribe to our aggrogator feed to see all of the activity on those services to handle this we need to once again revisit our data model

7335894 and mickey gets cuter because walt disney makes more money that way
7335895 evolution has been the focus of a lot of debate in our state this year
7335896 if you read the newspapers everyone is arguing is it a theory is it not a theory the answer is we can observe it we can see it happen just like you can see it in mickey
7335897 i can see that theres no way i came from an ape
7335898 is this really what they want us to teach for the next 10 years
7335899 i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man
7335900 we see lizards with different shaped tails we dont see blizzards the lizard bird
7335901 we also failed to include astrology alchemy and the concept of the moon being made of green cheese

7335903 bryce what is it called when natural laws are suspended what do you call it when water changes into wine
7335904 it cant tell you whats right and wrong it doesnt address ethics but it is not anti religion science and religion just ask different questions
7335905 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7335906 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
7335907 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
7335908 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
7335909 and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks
7335910 i still dont have a good feeling on how well any of them are internalizing any of this
7335911 its maybe the size of a dogs jaw or a cats
7335912 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god
7335913 thats why people stand strong with christianity because it teaches people to lead a good life and not do wrong

7335918 but theirs is a longer hand because they live in trees and their arms are very long
7335919 but this is happening over millions of years with humans if im lucky i might see four generations in my lifetime
7335920 then whatever we evolved from where did it evolve from
7335921 how does our hand go from being that long to just a smaller hand
7335922 individuals with small hands will have more children while those with bigger hands will disappear
7335923 but if we came from them why are they still around
7335924 just because a new population evolves doesnt mean the old one dies out

7335990 it really isnt that muc h of a surprise that it would eventually make its way to live action in 2002 warner brothers treated theatergoers with a delightfully enjoyable film that seemed more like an extended episode raja gosnells attention to detail and the incorporation of several episodic scenarios was a true tribute to his love of the animated gem gosnell was able to breathe a new life into the franchise and actually flesh out the two dimensional characters weve all grown to love to my utter dismay the results were abysmal the film lacked the groovy charm of the series it didnt seem to have a concrete link to the series in part due to the lack of references and the flimsy storyline was all over the place s portrayal of valerie was the films only redeeming quality ive always been a fan of this character and kudos to cbs for placing the first african american animated character on television speed racer
7335991 a charming show and much viewed favorite suffered with its cinematic treatment
7335992 was sillier that the show and didnt seem to work as a full length film
7335993 had various winning qualities and was a box office smash for 2007 in a large part bays decision to incorporate the various endearing qualities of humor from the show into the film made it even more enjoyable it couldve been a serious film and still have worked but the human traits of the transformers is a big reason i was drawn to the show the dark knight

7336140 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
7336141 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
7336142 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
7336143 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
7336144 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict an example is sudans darfur province where an ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
7336145 although climate change bears a significant conflict potential it can also transform the international system toward more cooperation if it is seen as a common threat that requires joint action
7336146 the bali roadmap has many good ideas but was criticized as being too vague to induce a major policy shift
7336147 nevertheless the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
7336148 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
7336149 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
7336150 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline
7336151 riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
7336152 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
7336153 global warming receives now more public and political attention than a few years ago
7336154 grass roots movements are emerging in the united states for protecting the climate and developing energy alternatives involving not only many local communities and companies but also influential states such as california led by gov arnold schwarzenegger

7336286 ci sono state letteralmente centinaia di migliaia di neonati che sono stati cresciuti con preparati a base di soia

7336302 cafestol is een vetachtig stofje dat in koffiebonen zit daardoor glimmen ze die stof komt via het drinken van koffie in het bloed en zet het lichaam aan tot het verhogen van het cholesterolgehalte dat kan weer dichtgeslibde aderen veroorzaken wat het risico op een hartaanval verhoogt vijf koppen koffie met 1 9 milligram cafestol de hoogste concentratie kun je vergelijken met vier boterhammen roomboter in plaats van dieetmargarine
7336303 ik deed van 1987 tot 1995 onderzoek in nederland en scandinavi naar de gezondheidsaspecten van koffie in scandinavi toonden we een duidelijk verband aan tussen cafestol en de kans op een hartaanval er zat daar meer cafestol in de koffie anderhalf tot twee keer zo veel als nu in deze automatenkoffie en dan drinken scandinavi rs nog eens veel m r koffie dan het nederlandse gemiddelde van vier tot vijf koppen
7336304 het risico hangt af van de gezondheid van de koffiedrinker een gezonde vrouw van twintig jaar die deze koffie drinkt zal niet snel een hartaanval krijgen een man van zestig met suikerziekte wel ik schat dat er niet meer dan tien infarcten per jaar door ontstaan niet veel maar je zult het maar n t zelf zijn
7336305 dat is niet te zien de werkgever kan bij de leverancier informeren en de automaat laten aanpassen of vervangen ook biedt de consumentenbond aan koffie te onderzoeken op cafestol in filterkoffie koffiepads en instantkoffie zit de stof helemaal niet
7336306 of je nu in een ziekenhuis werkt of in een autofabriek je hebt het recht op koffie zonder cafestol je kunt als werknemer immers niet kiezen alle automaten waar deze cafestolrijke koffie uit komt zouden moeten worden vervangen of door de leverancier zo afgesteld met filters en lagere waterdruk dat er geen cafestol in de koffie terecht komt

7336357 they have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it

7336392 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding he wrote in an excerpt which appeared in britains
7336393 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7336394 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7336395 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7336396 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire he wrote
7336397 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions
7336398 this is my first test away from stamford bridge what i expected i saw out on the field in england you never say first versus last is easy
7336399 why is he one of the best in the world because he is very clever it was a very good goal
7336400 tomorrow is the start of a new week and when i return to london i will discuss who stays and who goes
7336401 we have started with two wins but we are very early into the season if it was the last two games of the season then it would be different
7336402 the top teams only lose two or three games a season and we have missed an outstanding chance
7336403 chelsea have had a bad day in my opinion but one piece of brilliance by deco has won it for them
7336404 chelsea didnt at any stage look like they were going to romp it like they did against portsmouth last week our keeper has hardly had a save to make
7336405 sometimes you ride your own luck against the big teams but we havent had to ride our luck in this game my players gave me everything they had apart from a goal
7336406 i am so glad so happy after such a bad result in hungary and the way it ended there said massa
7336407 everyone did a fantastic job for me and it is a great result for the team to take pole to win the race and to clock the fastest lap you cannot ask for more than that after such a bad experience in budapest
7336408 as far as i am concerned i did nothing wrong it is more about adrian sutil than me
7336409 we have great reliability and a great package and no worries about any of that he said adding that he felt pain from his neck throughout the race
7336410 i woke up early on saturday morning and had a spasm in my neck hamilton explained
7336411 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7336412 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7336413 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7336414 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me he said
7336415 we got this third because of our great qualifying performance on saturday

7336441 yesterday he was very quick in qualifying and today he drove in impeccable style without putting a foot wrong to take what was a very well deserved win after the disappointment of budapest i want to compliment him and the whole team who have worked so hard in preparing for this event unfortunately once again we have suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races now we must continue to push to the maximum to develop the car and improve reliability in order to be as well prepared as possible for the forthcoming races we still have two test sessions at monza and then jerez and a lot of hard days work in the factory finally i want to say a few words about piero timpini our mechanic unfortunately injured in kimis second pit stop his first words were to say sorry as though the incident was his fault it is thanks to the passion dedication and professionalism that these guys show on a daily basis for ferrari how special is our team
7336442 its fantastic having won this race especially after the disappointment of budapest the team did an amazing job in preparing for this grand prix and the benefits of that could be seen right from the very first day yesterday i got pole and today the win with the race fastest lap as the icing on the cake you cannot ask for more especially at my one hundredth grand prix with every single one of them powered by a ferrari engine i got a good start and i pushed to the maximum right from the early laps in the second part of the race the car was exceptional but also in the final stint when i had the softer tyres i could do the lap times easily this is an important moment in my career and i must continue to work in this way i am sorry for what happened to kimi we have to look very carefully at our reliability i am confident the team knows which countermeasures to take to react to this issue as it has always done in the past
7336443 not much to say after a day like this it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and sixty points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated today i lost a place at the start and i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance

7336487 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7336488 theres a lot of hillary supporters that are concerned that obama doesnt have the experience necessary to be commander in chief and we are going to be very aggressive in reaching out to them
7336489 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7336490 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7336491 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7336492 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7336493 she also has her doctorate degree which is a problem but all kidding aside
7336494 getting the correct republican on that ballot is whats important to us
7336495 if were just going to put jim abeler back in that republican seat what does it matter if theres a dfler in the seat
7336496 its always a bad thing when you dont have the give and take
7336497 binaural beats affect our brainwaves directly and can alter moods behavior even consciousness
7336498 the real reason is secret service protection for my two girls as they enter into their teenaged years
7336499 whatever young guy comes by for a date were going to have one of these mean looking guys who dont crack a smile theyre armed theyre dangerous
7336500 i had the flu when i arrived and i had pretty hard fevers pretty much every day and low energy
7336501 i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck which kind of nearly did lead to me not racing this weekend
7336502 i just woke up very very early yesterday before 5am yesterday and i had the spasm in my neck
7336503 fortunately ive got a great doctor who was with me the whole way through it
7336504 it was so bad that i was struggling to basically stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers
7336505 fortunately as i said i have a great trainer who helped pedro de la rosa was looking forward to racing
7336506 no it wont be a problem again im pretty sure
7336507 its still sore it was probably something to do with my pillow the way i was sleeping because it was just when i woke up
7336508 by my count thats about 20 pages to read and about 30 calls to make but after four days and counting mr ofarrell still hasnt uttered a word
7336509 hes either making no effort at all or simply misleading the public either way hes taking the community for granted
7336510 the greens felt very strongly that this will be a highly significant test of the opposition environmental and economic credibility
7336511 his ability to resist lobbying from his friends in big business will be on trial
7336512 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7336513 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7336514 because there are already drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7336515 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7336516 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7336517 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7336518 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7336519 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7336520 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7336521 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7336522 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7336523 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7336524 the fire took place in the generator which is located in a conventional building that is separate from the reactor
7336525 all security systems of the installation operated as expected and they were not affected by the fire at this moment the reactor is stopped and stable the event did not have any impact on workers or the environment
7336526 we all agree whether we are for or against nuclear power that it should be safe and that means there can be no manipulation or covering up
7336527 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been destroyed and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elderly people have died
7336528 they have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it
7336529 so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7336530 once again the enemies of islam have stained their hands with the blood of innocent people we the muslim nation will not accept their apologies this time
7336531 we regret the loss of life among the innocent afghans who we are committed to protect
7336532 fay weakens to a depression but heavy rains and flooding could continue for several days
7336533 a flash flood watch is in effect through monday evening for much of south eastern louisiana
7336534 we have activated our teams as a precautionary measure for the safety of the public
7336535 we are ready to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7336536 but fay could become nearly stationary or stall on monday over eastern louisiana and southern mississippi
7336537 longest period of sustained economic growth for over 150 years
7336538 we have directed our militants to stop attacks against the government and security forces in bajaur from today
7336539 the jirga elders council insisted taliban should stop fighting in the interest of the people of bajaur
7336540 we are ready for talks with the government and the truce is an important development towards dialogue
7336541 we do not believe in their verbal commitments if they are sincere they should first surrender
7336542 five militants were killed in the mortar fire targeting suspected militant hideouts
7336543 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7336544 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7336545 she had 50 per cent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7336546 shes going to be an important an important voice in this campaign
7336547 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7336548 theyre going to be won over by the clintons appearance this week and what they say
7336549 hva er det f rste du da sier til deg selv
7336550 jeg sier mon tro hva jeg f r spise til frokost hva er det f rste du sier n ff
7336551 jeg sier jeg lurer p hvilke spennende ting som kommer til hende i dag
7336552 after one of the longest most animated debates the panel finally chose from this very strong shortlist a comedian whose work can only be summed up as utterly delightful an hour with david odoherty fills the world with laughter and charm and sends you home on a wave of happiness
7336553 all four nominees presented shows which combined outstanding material and performance
7336554 they could not have been more different from each other and are all well on their way to being household names
7336555 the greater difficulty the more glory in surmounting it skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests
7336556 obama has held a two point lead in all three of ppps virginia polls hes not having as much of a problem here as he is in some other states with nailing down the democratic vote an 84 12 lead with voters in his own party is not too dissimilar from john mccains 89 7 independents are basically split with obama leading 41 39
7336557 democratic leaders plan to use barack obama s acceptance speech thursday evening as the spearhead of a high tech effort to reach out simultaneously to millions of voters
7336558 the planned effort which will include asking all 75 000 or so people in the audience to text message or cell phone friends across the country represents the latest twist in the obama campaigns unprecedented use of communications technology
7336559 these reports are being investigated in afghanistan and well look for the results of that investigation
7336560 coalition forces take precautions to prevent the loss of civilians unlike the taliban and militants who target civilians and place civilians in harms way
7336561 in the tragic air strike and irresponsible and imprecise in azizabad village in shindand district more than 89 of our innocent countrymen including women and children were martyred
7336562 aware of allegations that the engagement in the shindad district of civilian casualties
7336563 the fire took place in the generator which is located in a conventional building that is separate from the reactor
7336564 all security systems of the installation operated as expected and they were not affected by the fire at this moment the reactor is stopped and stable the event did not have any impact on workers or the environment
7336565 it has not proven itself to be a responsible operator
7336566 there have been a series of grave mistakes and we are standing before the risk of a serious accident
7336567 gens is a sega megadrive genesis 32x and megacd emulator
7336568 statistical modeling shows that population size and income per head provide an almost faultless method for identifying medal totals
7336569 economic logic and an ingenious way of looking at the same factors through the opposite end of the telescope at youcalcs real olympic medal count
7336570 the negotiations only started thursday and we delivered an initial offer on friday
7336571 weve got another five days to bargain on this and we hope to make that best and final offer before labor day weekend
7336572 the wage package is below industry standards and its doubling or tripling health care costs in some cases kelliher said

7336578 there are currently 15 injured at bishkek hospital including two who are in intensive care
7336579 the real reason is secret service protection for my two girls as they enter into their teenaged years
7336580 whatever young guy comes by for a date were going to have one of these mean looking guys who dont crack a smile theyre armed theyre dangerous
7336581 there are people out there that have information that we still need
7336582 may have spoken with friends associates about what occurred on that night and wed like to hear from anyone that has information
7336583 we would prefer these persons contact us rather than we go to them
7336584 this doesnt bring john back but it does give the family answers to some questions theyve probably had
7336585 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7336586 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7336587 want peace shut up and let us do our job
7336588 im here to honor our son and the sacrifice he made for our country and to support the troops and the families who give so much

7336593 if the gap is really serious about embracing its responsibility to people and communities it needs to make sure its vendors are not hurting seniors and retired workers
7336594 i think this movie is going to be worth the wait
7336595 the stuff youd think a movie called star trek would require
7336596 there is a 500 acre low lying land near the project site where the ancillary units can come up and the government can decide on it if the government agrees we will show it to them
7336597 that is an old proposition that will not solve the problem
7336598 dont even look at walls of the tata motors factory
7336599 die spanier waren unglaublich respekt aber nun sind die usa zur ck an der spitze
7336600 wir haben als team gespielt es ist ein gro er sieg
7336601 der moment ist sehr speziell es ist gro artig ein teil dieser mannschaft zu sein

7336605 das olympische dorf war gro artig die wettkampfst tten erstklassig die organisation makellos
7336606 jedes land wird den aspekt hervorheben der ihm am geeignetsten erscheint
7336607 jedes land hat ein auswahlsystem solange das nach ethischen ma st ben l uft haben wir kein problem damit
7336608 das war keine sache von zwei wochen nur f r die spiele
7336609 wir fanden es ungew hnlich dass keiner dieser proteste stattfand

7336611 en caso de no lograr un acuerdo razonable es nuestra decisi n retomar el camino de la movilizaci n social el d a mi rcoles 27 de agosto del corriente con una nueva paralizaci n nacional de la atenci n primaria municipal y de mayor complejidad
7336612 es nuestra voluntad tratar de logra un buen acuerdo en la mesa tripartita a fin de evitar nuevas movilizaciones pero si ello no ocurre mantendremos a firme nuestro compromiso de una movilizaci n racional atendiendo todas las urgencias que lo requieran durante nuestras movilizaciones
7336613 when you are at the bottom of the table it is bloody important to get that win regardless of how it comes
7336614 hes a very good runner he spies a gap and hes got good acceleration so hes very handy to have
7336615 its been a big week its been a long week
7336616 were sick and tired of going into a changing room and feeling like that
7336617 theres plenty of effort going in but again some turnovers have hurt us and were battling for a bit of confidence right now
7336618 i know the players are frustrated about the last turnover they didnt feel it was their error
7336619 we were probably within three or four metres two or three times in that second half where i thought we really got our game going i thought our ball carriers were making good inroads
7336620 it will be a challenge for peter this week especially with the way the crowd reacted to him
7336621 but it will also show his character as a person and coach we will see if he is strong enough to handle it because this is the most difficult rugby job in the world
7336622 peter must understand that with south african rugby it is difficult to move away from the winning principle
7336623 whatever he is trying to do with the team winning still needs to be a priority were behind him and i ask people to have patience and to support the side
7336624 the buck stops with me and my administration it is our responsibility and we need to back him
7336625 the laws of the game have changed and we couldnt be fast asleep
7336626 were just not changing quick enough and we saw in the super 14 we cant win games under the new laws if we dont have speed
7336627 the game is much more intense under the new laws and players need to make decisions quicker on the field
7336628 i believe we are on the right track and the players believe it as well we just have to get used to it we do a lot of things right but we are sometimes just that part of a second too late and there is that one pass that doesnt stick or go outside
7336629 it is understandable the boks have been playing a certain way for years and were trying to change it suddenly we have to be patient
7336630 im not unhappy with the way we are playing but it bothers me a lot that we are not accurate enough on the field
7336631 it is a difficult thing for us to adapt to in the past when things didnt work out for us we would revert back to the drive but with the new laws the drives are sacked and now we have nothing to go back to if things dont work
7336632 these special cocktails need to be shared with the world
7336633 and an ideological war it is our country and we will defend it
7336634 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taleban definitely have the upper hand
7336635 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7336636 it could well still be staged in pakistan but the board decided today that if there are doubts four five or six months ahead of the due date of october next year then the board would seek to relocate it
7336637 it was considered but dismissed very rapidly quite simply because there was no longer sufficient lead time to relocate the event in the same time frame
7336638 three countries had indicated to me privately ahead of south africas decision that they would not be able to send a squad for reasons of safety and security
7336639 the aerospace data facility is a dod information processing analysis relay and test facility supporting the u s government and its allies
7336640 the major u s based technical downlink for intelligence satellites operated by the military the national security agency and the national reconnaissance office
7336641 from intels position that seems like the thing to shoot for right now it could be that cellphones and p d a s are even more compelling but i think we are going to start with the laptop its easy to dial down from laptops
7336642 i absolutely cant vouch for the truth of this story
7336643 the real reason is secret service protection for my two girls as they enter into their teenaged years
7336644 whatever young guy comes by for a date were going to have one of these mean looking guys who dont crack a smile theyre armed theyre dangerous
7336645 porque dios quiere que te salves de ir al infierno porque el te ama mucho y l quiere que te vayas al cielo que no alabes a otros dioses etc
7336646 its been x amount of time since ive seen a dark knight story on the front page of digg
7336647 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
7336648 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
7336649 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music
7336650 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control
7336651 ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now
7336652 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 6 to 12 inches across the extreme western portion of the northern florida peninsula the florida panhandle southwestern georgia the southern and central portions of mississippi and alabama and eastern louisiana
7336653 mobilize to their duty stations 8 a m sunday and monitor canals and levees in the city
7336654 however we are prepared to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7336655 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7336656 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7336657 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7336658 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7336659 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
7336660 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7336661 people who know me know that im not a shrinking violet
7336662 i didnt sign up to be the guy who plays the harlem globetrotters
7336663 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
7336664 being on fox is like going into the second room
7336665 obamas narrative is being altered enhanced and manipulated to whitewash troubling facts
7336666 if only one parent was a u s citizen at the time of your birth that parent must have resided in the united states for at least ten years at least five of which had to be after the age of 16
7336667 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the us of america joe biden
7336668 fay weakens to a depression but heavy rains and flooding could continue for several days
7336669 we have activated our teams as a precautionary measure for the safety of the public
7336670 we are ready to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7336671 but fay could become nearly stationary or stall on monday over eastern louisiana and southern mississippi

7336676 e ti sembra che la paura di fallire valga una vita in questo nido valga una vita monotona e piena di paure una vita non goduta
7336677 sei sicuro che non sai oppure non vuoi sapere la risposta alla mia domanda
7336678 io voglio guarire voglio provare sensazioni quello che pensavo non era mai la realt voglio lasciar andare via il dolore che ho provato fino adesso cancellare proprio tutto il dolore io voglio guarire voglio provare sensazioni sentirmi vicina a qualcosa di vero voglio trovare qualcosa che ho voluto fino adesso qualche luogo a cui appartenere

7336688 overture 1928 sets up many of the later themes in a conceptual doorway to the regression and its vigorous virtuoso playing
7336689 the fed listens to wall street and believes what it hears
7336690 this distortion into a partial and often highly distorted perception of reality is unhealthy and dangerous
7336691 often feature an alluring mix of brilliant insight and outrageous statements
7336692 you dont let your borrower determine the value of the collateral offered to you
7336693 i start to shiver and shake with a strange kind of blues but i like it
7336694 why have just one hoe when you can have a hoegaarden
7336695 i cannot teach anybody anything i can only make them think
7336696 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
7336697 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
7336698 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win

7336702 elle tiendra parole cest ce quelle nous confirme dans une interview r alis e par t l phone ce midi
7336703 we could have an 80 percent turnout in defiance county
7336704 voting early alleviates lines at the polls especially if you are a provisional voter
7336705 we encourage people to use this option if they wish
7336706 the voting machines we use in defiance county come from the same company but we havent had any problems
7336707 we feel good about the security and accuracy of these machines i want to assure the public about that
7336708 we have never sent voting machines home with poll workers
7336709 we have a delivery company that delivers the machines to each polling place the morning of the election
7336710 the machines are locked down with a cable chip and a tamper proof seal the seal isnt broken until the next morning probably 5 30 6 a m it can only be broken by the precincts presiding judge
7336711 very few people chose to register and vote at the same time will more people take advantage of it this year well see
7336712 even for those people who register during the time when they can vote early most vote on election day
7336713 i think some of these people want more time to listen and study the candidates before they vote
7336714 people need to double check if they have any doubt in their mind
7336715 this saves a ton of time and paperwork on election day if you have changed your name or address since you voted last you need to fill out a new registration card you can do that at the drivers license bureau public library or here at the election board
7336716 if people dont know if they are registered properly they should call the election board
7336717 thats what we are here for to serve the public we welcome these calls and can look up registration information very quickly this saves a lot of time at the polls and it keeps people from voting a provisional ballot
7336718 we have a job to do regardless how many people vote
7336719 but we dont like it as much when only 30 percent turn out
7336720 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no

7336722 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7336723 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7336724 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7336725 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7336726 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7336727 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7336728 this decision reaches beyond the medical profession taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american
7336729 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
7336730 health care workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
7336731 in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
7336732 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
7336733 poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
7336734 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
7336735 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
7336736 its not in direct response to that but weve seen much increased activity in terms of russian overflights of canadian airspace the americans are seeing the same thing around alaska
7336737 so thats one element but its not the only element its something that is now starting to give us some cause for serious concern
7336738 what many thought was a somewhat silly flag planting incident in canadas arctic
7336739 i would say no they are not winning the war
7336740 canadians are not going to be intimidated weve got more grit than that
7336741 these products have been distributed nationally to retail stores and food service institutions such as restaurants hospitals nursing homes and other institutional cafeterias or kitchens
7336742 these products may also be sold at deli counters if the original product identity and best before code is not evident consumers are advised to check with their retailer to determine if the product is included in the list of recalled products
7336743 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria

7336769 ey are mate ill lose ten seconds stopping for you so you can get by me
7336770 my dream ticket would be obama and clinton preferably clinton first but seeing as thats not likely to happen now then id like her to be second together they cover a vast group of voters from all demographics
7336771 i supported clinton because of her economic and social security policies
7336772 i am a youth hispanic who supports hillary which is a rather rare demographic
7336773 everything that she has done and stands for is similar to what i aspire to be like its a great honor to represent the youth in denver as a national delegate
7336774 im excited about seeing so many big people im really excited about seeing how politics work on a national level as compared to the state level and local level im a little worried about the amount ofprotestors police that i saw in denver yesterday i hope that the speech at invesco field goes well and the weather is nice im also happy to be able to go to several events where i can possibly meet lots and lots of new people
7336775 my thoughts on biden he will add a lot of experience to baracks resume as a candidate however i feel that hillary would add just as much experience that senator biden does i also think that biden wont really help out a whole lot with crucial states whereas i think hillary would guarantee a big state like new york and greatly affect others like pennsylvania ohio and texas i understand that you shouldnt pick a vp based solely on the fact that they will help sway more states and win an election but there must be a reason or several for that matter that that person can and will sway those states as disappointed as i am that hillary wasnt his pick i think that biden will serve the u s as the vp well
7336776 it is time for the change that the american people need
7336777 with joe biden by my side i am confident that we can take this country in a new direction
7336778 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman who doesnt hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7336779 my mom and dad raised me to believe the test is not how many times you get knocked down
7336780 it is how quickly you get up thats the america that barack obama and i believe in
7336781 really i was thinking maybe he would choose colin powell
7336782 relatively careful to make sure you understand that hes not a quote unquote new democrat but he also makes clear hes not an old democrat
7336783 youre going to see greater federal activism because there will be the expectation that he reacts to the countrys problems and finds answers to them
7336784 if he doesnt the democrats will be out on their ear from congress
7336785 during the course of the campaign and debates what people have to find out is wheres his bottom line
7336786 obamas all about change and compromise but in washington the first lesson you learn is you can only compromise from strength strength means that people know what you stand for thats what he has to define before the republicans do
7336787 what are the four or five goals that they plan to accomplish
7336788 by and large the conservatives shaped politics for a generation
7336789 now theyre out of answers so theres this ripe moment and we need to fill that moment
7336790 having an infrastructure independent of the party arms the activists
7336791 when theyre at their neighborhood barbecue theyll have answers when someone claims that say obama is muslim
7336792 if you ask whats distinctive about obama i would say it has much more to do with leadership style and generational appeal than it does with a clear departure either doctrinally or programmatically
7336793 the capture of abu tiba and abu uthman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi al qaeda in iraq network
7336794 that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s

7336829 at its core branding is simply the art of surrounding a product organization or person with a powerful and compelling story
7336830 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
7336831 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
7336832 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
7336833 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
7336834 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
7336835 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
7336836 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one

7336841 were still working hard to ensure compatibility between the titles currently on the market and we hope to have an announcement on that shortly
7336842 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7336843 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7336844 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7336845 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7336846 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7336847 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7336848 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7336849 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7336850 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7336851 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down

7336858 they deport them at any hour at 10 p m at midnight and in some cases they wind up in the street or they sleep in the offices of mexican immigration agents

7336868 the real reason is secret service protection for my two girls as they enter into their teenaged years
7336869 whatever young guy comes by for a date were going to have one of these mean looking guys who dont crack a smile theyre armed theyre dangerous
7336870 the real reason is secret service protection for my two girls as they enter into their teenaged years
7336871 they should have said to dallas stay where you are and brought out another runner or parked up the truck they were not only risking the life of my boy but the other two boys as well
7336872 even though he sommers is gone his spirit is still here
7336873 the kids used to carry his ashes to the bedroom and put him on the couch and watch tv with him
7336874 you do whatever you can to try and move on from that terrible accident
7336875 i know youve been waiting with baited breath to hear about my first two dates the first was with friendster guy for lunch hes even cuter in person than in his picture he has beautiful gray eyes hes also very nice and sweet i was really unsure of myself with him but i dont think its a match i think we could definitely be friends but hed have to grow on me to be more than that unfortunately he is way too similar to my stbx soon to be x husband 1 same name 2 grew up in nj 3 only child 4 raised catholic the more he told me about himself the more i wanted to start laughing at the irony he explained at one point that if he lapsed into silence i should try not to feel uncomfortable he was just quiet here i was eating with someone i met at complete random on the internet and he was my stbxs doppelganger i think i need to email him and say i had a good time but i want to be just friends i can use the completely valid excuse of him being the first person i met after the divorce in fact my divorce came up in conversation and i came totally clean about the timing and i even told him about his similarities to stbx i told him if he wanted to run screaming from the room he could he didnt he was very nice about the whole thing i think he took it upon himself to make this transition as easy as possible for me he mentioned that our date was a training date gosh hes a nice guy i think i already know what friend ill set him up with
7336876 in other news because my life just seems to be one big ball of craziness i left the mildly dull date and ran into friendster 1 at walmart
7336877 friendster guy and i have been emailing each other i told him about the pot incident and he agreed on the lameness hes going to make a nice friend
7336878 i just got home from a date with friendster guy he really is a sweetheart a foot taller than me but very cute and less quiet than he was on our first date we had indian food and then we went to a bookstore and wandered around while drinking coffee it was very relaxed and wed both like to get together again we had a nice conversation about our experiences with match com and the people we are also currently dating it makes me feel less sleazy and underhanded to know he knows im seeing other people and its good to know he is as well takes the pressure off of me a little
7336879 so if you arent feeling that spark find it with someone else who is nice handsome sweet and intelligent
7336880 no buts youre looking for a connection young lady not someone whos nice enough to hang out with if youre forcing yourself to feel something it means you arent feeling anything piss or get off the pot
7336881 oh please you arent in a committed relationship stop it before youd feel even worse if you broke up youve met a nice guy who can now be a nice friend you happen to have seen naked end of story
7336882 my first act since declaring it the year of me was to follow my own advice and email friendster guy about our relationship or lack thereof
7336883 hey we have no chemistry it was nice meeting you
7336884 after my email friendster guy really took the time to let me know at least some of what he was feeling in our situation and hes growing on me again slowly and persistently like a fungus but growing none the less i think part of the missing chemistry had to do with our very early decision after our first date to just be friends he took it to heart i had loosened up on that restriction but hadnt let him know so when we were out he wasnt being all that flirty and i am receptive to flirting since we hadnt done any flirting foreplay i didnt think there was chemistry we need some more time to go out when both of us are thinking were dating and see how it goes i bet it goes well
7336885 in the spirit of full disclosure i should let you know i am signed up to auction myself off at a batchelor batchelorette auction next month
7336886 how much does a single girl go for these days will i have to bring my checkbook
7336887 friendster guy being at least superficially like my x is turning out to be a good thing for one he keeps surprising me by not being like my x a pleasant surprise now and again does a body good you know what else does a body good well something else i choose not to talk about directly on this blog thats what anyway another reason the similarities he has with my x and my fears around that are good is i am forced to take note of how i react to things he does or things i think he will do with some other guy completely unlike my x id still have the same fears but i might not address them directly or even recognize the way they make me react for instance i am slightly nervous or at least shy to ask friendster guy to dinner with some friends of mine as mentioned previously my x was not really social and made me jump through hoops to get him to go anywhere with me i find myself making assumptions that friendster guy will not want to go however because i am aware of his similarities to x and am trying to counteract my potential reaction to them i am working against those assumptions does any of that make sense lets see if i can make it simpler acknowledging you have a problem is the first step in any 12 step program with a guy dissimilar to my x i might not realize i have a problem i e all the neurotic crazy things floating in my head as a result of my last relationship but with friendster guy they pop right to the surface and i must face them i might have to share this with friendster guy so he can be aware of why i might do some of the things i do
7336888 the closest thing i have to a boyfriend at the moment friendster guy is taking me out this evening to the theater
7336889 i had a great conversation with friendster guy last night i got over myself and insecurity and fear of rejection and finally told him about this blog and some other stuff his main reaction was surprise that he hadnt found it already until i told him that it was anonymous i told him some of the content and how it started out as a journal of my life as a single girl and therefore chronicles the early days when we met i said id be happy to let him read it but if he went into the archives hed have to promise me hed keep reading because otherwise hed only get bits and pieces of my feelings right at that moment in time and that wouldnt be fair he agreed and said he understood he said he wasnt sure he wanted to read it because he didnt want to change the art of the thing see he totally gets it he keeps surprising me that friendster guy i told him that what i write has already changed out of respect for him and our relationship he laughed when i said he had a fan base and people rooting for him i asked him to tell me if anything i wrote affected him in a negativeway he seems to be a much more private person than i so he might not appreciate some of the things ive written or he could continue to surprise me and thinks its all hilarious its a little bit of an experiment i must say its a risk im willing to take

7336894 five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered except maybe toward the end a little bit on the clay
7336895 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7336896 it was very different to winning alone on a tennis court
7336897 i think it was berlin i said i dont care if i win the match or lose but ill just do what my coach tells me and just go for the shots certainly it worked out and why i was not doing this before
7336898 and now of course i think that was a really breakthrough because i beat really good players there
7336899 i hope my experience will be a little more valuable than his potential at this point i think hes a name that will be household name hopefully in a couple years i hope he doesnt make it household name this time
7336900 we dont want a blanket ban which will restrict people from sitting down at the point and having a glass of wine with a barbecue and when you start putting exceptions in the laws become too cumbersome
7336901 we tend to over complicate our bylaws its better to look at what outcomes we want and how to police it if it is too hard to police it wont work
7336902 we are drawing a line in the sand about prohibited acts in relation to alcohol that is the essence of the problem and we are putting out a message to the police that it is unacceptable for anyone consuming alcohol to behave in a bad manner
7336903 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7336904 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7336905 ive never stomped before but i want to be a part of this
7336906 were just polling yes or no not trying to find converts or change peoples minds

7336908 while death and divorce may prevent it in too many cases the ideal situation for children is to be raised by a married mother and father proposition 8 is a positive step
7336909 they want people to feel like you are a bad person if you support what has been the definition of marriage since the dawn of time

7336915 wow i can make a living blogging about personal finance
7336916 i want to apologize to those who were disappointed in my newscast that night
7336917 but i have been working very very hard to bring them some good elements that did come together and i was feeling good about that
7336918 i dont want to play a violin but i am still recovering
7336919 its a process i have to ask people to be patient with that in terms of slurring and things
7336920 she has been trying to battle back from being sick and she was just way overtired she had been working all day and she isnt supposed to be
7336921 its the week before the convention and while its an exciting time because im going to cover it its also stressful because you have to get ready for it i want to assure viewers that i have been working my tail off all week
7336922 a catcher an infielder an outfielder we haven t determined yet how many pitchers the catcher will not be matt wieters matt wieters will not be coming up here in september weve hopefully put that situation to rest
7336923 he gets six weeks off before that plus from my perspective him going to the fall league is not so much for him to do anything other than to catch and maybe to catch some pitchers that are a little more advanced he doesnt need to show me anything as far as hitting catching or throwing the reports ive gotten on him have been outstanding
7336924 it is a total disgrace this proud night for britain has been sullied by this grotesque representation of london
7336925 clearly whoever was responsible must be found and fired immediately
7336926 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7336927 senator bidens plagiarism of a speech by british labor party leader neal kinnock took place at a campaign stump at the iowa state fairgrounds
7336928 im in this race to stay im in this race to win
7336929 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7336930 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7336931 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7336932 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7336933 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7336934 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7336935 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7336936 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7336937 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7336938 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7336939 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7336940 but youd make such a great president youre organized youre a great communicator and you have that leadership thing going on
7336941 plus i really dont know who else can do it besides you
7336942 canada is discussing the situation in georgia with its allies including the g8 and nato we are going to take a decision in consultation with our allies who share our values
7336943 i can remember it taking like 12 hours after the polls closed before you had an idea of who was really going to come down and win
7336944 i registered to vote when i was 18 years old and have not missed voting since then
7336945 a lot of people just go to vote against somebody rather than for somebody
7336946 really i was proud that the democratic party and the courts upheld our certification of the primary results
7336947 not that i was against anybody but i think we did everything to the best of our ability
7336948 achievements in the interest of mankind and friendly relations among peoples irrespective of nationality race colour religion sex or political views
7336949 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7336950 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7336951 the prime minister did make it clear to china that she should be released
7336952 we have done it in the past and weve done it for presidential state of the unions also but never to this extent theres never this much interest in a presidential acceptance speech so this is very unique
7336953 were getting the vote out by doing mailers and phone calls and maintaining the headquarter space keeping the lights on paying the rent in san mateo county to help san mateo county democrats so thats really what we need the money for
7336954 the difference in the game was our inconsistency and not sustaining our game plan
7336955 unfortunately im not sure that our dealings with russia have mirrored the changes that have taken place there
7336956 and at the same time they have nursed a lot of grudges that having made a comeback and having achieved recovery they are still being treated like they were in 1995
7336957 i believe that in order to improve relations with russia it is necessary not to pull the former soviet republics into political military blocs but to develop relations with russia itself
7336958 and then the actions of the bloc in a few years will not be perceived so acutely in this country as is the case today
7336959 a lot of times in politics you have people look you in the eye and tell you whats not on their mind
7336960 he looks you in the eye and tells you whats on his mind hes been very truthful and to me thats the only way you can find common ground and to be able to deal in a way that you dont let your disputes interrupt your relationships
7336961 on these kinds of things as president kennedy did during the cuban missile crisis you deal with the points that are being made on the other side with which you can agree or with which you want to work
7336962 we all tend to believe that mr putin calls the main shots even if mr medvedev tends from time to time to look like a friendlier bear to deal with
7336963 it shows a mindset about russia that tends to see it through the neoconservative prism of basically being a soviet threat

7336966 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7336967 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7336968 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7336969 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7336970 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7336971 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7336972 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7336973 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7336974 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7336975 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7336976 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7336977 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7336978 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7336979 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7336980 yes we are looking at him but there is no deal yet
7336981 my general manager is out there at the moment having a look he played yesterday
7336982 it is a possibility and there might be something happening but i am very very pleased with what we have got and what we have done
7336983 i would love here genuinely to buy british and young british like i did with lee cattermole
7336984 then you wouldnt have the problem of them flying to honduras and mexico city on international duty when they are away for days people say that you should know that when you sign them but i have no choice
7336985 i didnt like to have to go to cairo to get egypt international striker amr zaki but when you see him play you can see it was worth it
7336986 its very disappointing for darragh darragh is a very passionate player
7336987 he has given fantastic service as an amateur player to this game unfortunately he gets targeted and blamed and painted with different brushes all his career
7336988 it was disappointing for him today to get sent off
7336989 players in all games are targeted but for some players certain players are pencilled out because of their talent or because of their inspiration
7336990 were still in the championship nothing has changed it would have been nice to finish the job today but it wasnt to be and i mean thats sport we felt in control but cork are always likely to create some chances and obviously they did that
7336991 im here firstly for the experience and i will certainly get that if i play regularly in matches like this and travel with the team
7336992 it is what i need really i couldnt get that much at arsenal so i am happy to be here and happy to know im going to get more games than at arsenal
7336993 i dont remember too much about that game except old trafford but i know it was tough that day they were a lot stronger
7336994 i had sunderland manchester city newcastle stoke hull and west ham all interested in me its great to know that interest was there
7336995 the board have accepted the bid hes not renegotiated his contract and the decision was taken out of my hands
7336996 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7336997 we are thin on the ground if we lose another defender we will have to react to that
7336998 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7336999 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7337000 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7337001 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7337002 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7337003 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7337004 we are continuously month after month publish new titles that bring something unique and different target groups

7337008 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7337009 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7337010 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7337011 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7337012 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7337013 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7337014 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7337015 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7337016 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7337017 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7337018 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7337019 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7337020 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7337021 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7337022 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7337023 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7337024 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7337025 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7337026 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7337027 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7337028 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7337029 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7337030 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7337033 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7337034 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7337035 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

7337055 youngsters today dont talk the way they used to 20 30 years ago their vocabulary is faster and more to the point with time im sure the lines of dialogue will get even simpler
7337056 dialogue doesnt register with the audience any more because today films just run for three or four weeks it was in the 1970s and 80s that we saw the last of the great silver and golden jubilee runs
7337057 our societys lingo has changed and so has the dialogue today commercial cinema is primarily catering to the metros so forget hindustani today the language spoken in our movies is hinglish
7337058 now we try to write dialogue that will touch the viewers heart earlier the characters would be larger than life
7337059 no credit masoom complains that the dialogue writer is not given his deserved status
7337060 obama is but i think he would want to create some excitement on one hand or some gravitas on the other
7337061 they serve on different committees in the senate and they did not spend time together before the indiana primary because evan was supporting hillary
7337062 he is going to have to simply really attract some attention
7337063 this particular process has exposed to the country that evan bayh is not only mentioned as a great former governor but a leader
7337064 this has only further enhanced his profile as a national leader
7337065 i share the disappointment of many hoosiers that my partner in the senate evan bayh was not selected on this occasion but i believe he will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7337066 the economy hasnt changed the price of gas hasnt gone down the price of food is up
7337067 i think sen obamas chances of winning today saturday are as good as they were yesterday
7337068 its very likely that the obama campaign looked at the polls and said even with evan bayh and the millions weve already spent we cant win indiana
7337069 the two photographs are manually torn and glued together no photoshop
7337070 it was good for us we knew that facility very well and it was nice and loud for us so we had that going but it was also about a lot of good players playing well and thats what we have to have at the new place
7337071 i think its going to be a great time for us to get started on a new year a fresh year
7337072 guys are coming back i think its just all around great for this city and this state to bring a new stadium here and have us start doing bigger things
7337073 the first couple of games you only get about 15 plays last week we got 25
7337074 so far its gone pretty good except for getting field goals instead of touchdowns
7337075 it was very difficult and it is very difficult to get motivated but with the help of friends family and my agent we just keep pressing on
7337076 you have to keep looking at that light you have to keep saying something could happen and you have to be ready for it
7337077 when we came in here that was our goal was to get better as an individual and as an offensive unit and weve done that

7337088 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7337089 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7337090 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7337091 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7337092 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7337093 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7337106 jeg har l st hans udtalelser men det er jo ingenting i forhold til den massive kritik jeg uds tter ham for i artiklen
7337107 when you are greeted with a greeting return it with a better greeting or its equal surely the lord takes account of all things
7337108 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding he wrote in an excerpt which appeared in britains
7337109 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7337110 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7337111 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7337112 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire he wrote
7337113 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions
7337114 i am so glad so happy after such a bad result in hungary and the way it ended there said massa
7337115 everyone did a fantastic job for me and it is a great result for the team to take pole to win the race and to clock the fastest lap you cannot ask for more than that after such a bad experience in budapest
7337116 as far as i am concerned i did nothing wrong it is more about adrian sutil than me
7337117 we have great reliability and a great package and no worries about any of that he said adding that he felt pain from his neck throughout the race
7337118 i woke up early on saturday morning and had a spasm in my neck hamilton explained
7337119 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7337120 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7337121 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7337122 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me he said
7337123 we got this third because of our great qualifying performance on saturday
7337124 in space your only limited by yourself there is no edge and therefore no to limit your ideas so it is upon your creativity and your very own self to make your own edges starting and stopping points

7337126 marketers are creating more and more different types of media
7337127 and yet consumers are increasingly fed up with being bombarded by all these media

7337129 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7337130 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7337131 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7337132 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7337133 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7337134 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7337135 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7337136 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

7337138 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7337139 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7337140 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7337141 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7337142 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7337143 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7337144 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7337145 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7337146 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7337147 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7337148 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7337149 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7337150 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7337151 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7337152 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7337153 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7337154 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7337155 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7337156 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7337157 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7337158 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7337159 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7337160 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7337161 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7337162 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7337163 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7337164 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7337165 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7337166 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7337167 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7337168 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7337169 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7337170 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7337171 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7337172 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7337173 secretary of state kurt browning was considering delaying tuesdays elections in parts of the state hit hard by fay but he said he wont know for sure until sunday or monday and hell rely on what county supervisors of elections tell him
7337174 democratic delegates from michigan and florida were awarded full voting rights at the national convention sunday despite holding early primaries against party rules
7337175 t he legacy of theresa lepore the palm beach county elections chief who gave voters the
7337176 popular among seniors and jewish voters biden could be helpful to obama in florida and in states like pennsylvania and ohio where obama struggled during the primaries
7337177 he has been a huge supporter of israel and has been so in a very erudite fashion because he knows all the players not only in israel but in the palestinian authority
7337178 hes a true lunch bucket democrat its a perfect choice
7337179 a generation of democratic voters that sen obama is not doing as well with as he would like at this point would be very attracted to joe biden
7337180 barack obamas choice of joe biden as a running mate could give the ticket a boost in florida thanks to bidens ties to south florida including support among a cadre of influential democratic fundraisers
7337181 hes not likely to confuse sunnis and shiites or al qaida and hezbollah forget that czechoslovakia ceased to exist approximately 15 years ago or for all his verbal stumbles sing about bombing iran all of which john mccain an alleged foreign policy specialist did
7337182 after a long and contentious presidential primary season in which florida played a central role democrats hold their national convention this week with the aim of projecting strength and unity behind the first black presidential nominee of a major party
7337183 after enduring months of political exile florida democrats giddily find themselves back in the center of the political universe as they head to a history making convention
7337184 state compensation reports show u s sugar spent more to lobby the executive branch than any other company in the first half of 2008 the investment paid off in june when crist announced florida would buy out the company in a 1 75 billion transaction designed to help restore the everglades
7337185 republicans will decide in tuesdays primary who among four candidates will be the next district 31 state representative no democrats filed to run in the race to replace mitch needelman who faces term limits and a legal loophole will keep them and independents from voting because a write in candidate announced a campaign
7337186 hes exciting hes likeable hes a great campaigner but then what said miami lawyer ira leesfield a top clinton fundraiser who now supports obama but is no longer aggressively raising money obamas mission this week create comfort
7337187 unlike many televangelists and mega church preachers the rev warren has an admirable record of using his wealth and influence to fight poverty illiteracy and hiv aids he could have done the country a service by turning the interviews away from the abortion debate and toward some of the causes he has championed it doesnt take a theologian to ask politicians hard questions about the moral conduct of government agnostics or atheists can do the interviewing just as well
7337188 early voting for tuesdays primary election appears lower in hillsborough county than in the past but officials arent sure whether the drop signals a trend or a concession to mother nature
7337189 president bush declared sunday that four florida counties hit hardest by tropical storm fay are major disaster areas making them eligible for federal aid the declaration makes funds available for emergency work and repairs to governments in brevard monroe okeechobee and st lucie counties
7337190 it took gov crist lusting after a spot on the mccain ticket all of a day after sen mccains conversion to drop his opposition to more drilling floridas republican senator mel martinez now also wants further review of the offshore drilling issue those were attacks on florida from within and then the attacks got bipartisan
7337191 p olitical courage like oil can be hard to find
7337192 the st johns river could hit central florida this week with some of the worst flooding on record runoff from fay is gorging nearly every part of the 310 mile st johns river which forms south of melbourne and flows north to the orlando area and on to jacksonville
7337193 water district officials might open canal gates that allow water to flow from the upper reaches of the river to the indian river lagoon along the coast but thats an option of last resort because of significant environmental harm that results by dumping fresh water into a slightly salty ecosystem
7337194 and florida will be in the center of it all
7337195 floridas primary on tuesday is the one and only chance for voters to elect judges and to send party nominees into the general election in november
7337196 it took a lot of courage for a maitland housewife to say that particularly when the boss man worships at the feet of luminaries like charles krauthammer
7337197 in race to see who handles fiscal mess better florida leads california 1 0 by you soon
7337198 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7337199 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7337200 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7337201 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7337202 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7337203 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7337204 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7337205 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7337206 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7337207 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7337208 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7337209 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7337210 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7337211 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7337212 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7337213 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7337214 salans opened its moscow office the same year as the moscow times was first published for the foreign community the existence of an independent english language newspaper was one of very few keys to understanding the business political and cultural life of the country and to follow the radical changes russia was going through over the years the newspaper has continued to develop its reputation as a highly regarded source of information and a forum for different points of views on the affairs of russia and its neighbors
7337215 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7337216 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7337217 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7337218 if you live each day as it was your last someday youll most certainly be right
7337219 if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today

7337229 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7337230 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7337231 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7337232 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7337233 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7337234 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7337235 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7337303 she was just an absolutely wonderful person she was a very dynamic person who was way ahead of her time
7337304 she was a liberated individual woman way before many women were and we benefited from it my brother and i were very lucky she came into our lives
7337305 she was just part of the family she was included in anything we did

7337312 but she taylor said i want you to sleep over at my house in kimball
7337313 she gave me her key and said i want you to see if my room is in order she gave me these strange directions so i went to the house and it seemed in disarray drawers were opened like somebody had gone through her things my husband and i looked around near her bed and i found a bank book hidden and thats when i found out she had a sizable estate
7337314 on the day we left west virginia mr parker claimed she taylor wrote a check for 80 000 to him
7337315 at that point in time i could not get a call through to bea unless i called three or four times and left messages previous to that i could get a call through anytime day or night
7337316 to themselves and defeated her taylors wishes that she wanted to leave everything to mrs kramer
7337317 when the judge dismissed the jury everyone of them walked by us
7337318 and at least eight or nine of the 12 stopped shook my hand and said god bless you i had tears in my eyes the foreman walked back shook my hand and said god bless you dear i was so grateful
7337319 we were clearly outsiders and they were so fair and decent i think they weeded out the truth
7337320 these people just made me so proud to be an american
7337321 they were so thoughtful they considered everything even if theyd ruled against me they followed it the case closely and i was so grateful to them
7337322 it is a total disgrace this proud night for britain has been sullied by this grotesque representation of london
7337323 clearly whoever was responsible must be found and fired immediately
7337324 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7337325 end gt vacuum a realization in ix movements composed by michael einziger thank you all for coming to see the performance of my first ever concert piece written for the orchestra i truly do not know what i am doing end vaccum is a collection of orchestral music i have been writing over the past year a 45 minute long insomnia induced orchestral anxiety attack rather than record this music and release it as an album i thought it would be much more risky and fun for the maiden voyage of end vacuum to happen as a live unedited performance in front of my family friends and fans with all mishaps intact the music will be performed in nine movements by a group of musicians i am calling the graviton modern ensemble and will be a mixture of professional philharmonic players and friends throughout the piece i will be playing alongside my brother benjamin einziger and my good friend blake mills suzie katayama my musical mentor will be conducting tonights program will begin with a lecture by esteemed british physicist dr brian cox a world renowned scientist and bbc correspondent dr cox is currently conducting monumental research at the large hadron collider lhc at cern the european organization for nuclear research the large hadron collider is a particle accelerator and is the largest most powerful complex expensive machine ever built by humans google it tonights discussion on particle physics will detail the potential for major scientific discoveries at cern in the near future all of this could make for an amazing evening here at ucla or it could be a massive train wreck whatever the case i want to thank you profusely for being a part of this cheers mike
7337326 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
7337327 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
7337328 i could not then truthfully deny that this book which came out in 1968 as a greenleaf classic was mine
7337329 in the introduction to sex rebel davis explains that although he has
7337330 im not one to go in for lolitas usually id rather not bed a babe under 20 but there are exceptions i didnt want to disappoint the trusting child at her still impressionistic age a rejection might be traumatic could even cripple her sexually for life
7337331 it could well still be staged in pakistan but the board decided today that if there are doubts four five or six months ahead of the due date of october next year then the board would seek to relocate it
7337332 it was considered but dismissed very rapidly quite simply because there was no longer sufficient lead time to relocate the event in the same time frame
7337333 three countries had indicated to me privately ahead of south africas decision that they would not be able to send a squad for reasons of safety and security
7337334 in fact of the eight participating teams five of the teams had indicated that they would not be able to send a team to pakistan in the current circumstances
7337335 it was either relocating to sri lanka or the second option was to keep the right to host the tournament by agreeing to its postponement
7337336 the first option was not acceptable to us as then we would lose our right to host the tournament we would have also lose the money assured to us as the host country so ultimately it was decided that the tournament be rescheduled
7337337 cricket is not going to die here i am sure of that
7337338 we are passing through a difficult phase but it is not going to last forever
7337339 the ecb made it clear to the icc last week that ecb had a duty of care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised
7337340 the ecb explained their reservations and security concerns about staging the tournament in the aftermath of the resignation of the pakistan president pervez musharraf last monday
7337341 of all the many masterpieces that could could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice
7337342 the media coverage of the georgian war a comparative perspective
7337343 thompson said the future of china and that of the rest of the world were more closely bonded than theyd ever been and the beijing olympic games
7337344 thompson sagte die zukunft chinas und des rests der welt werden enger miteinander verbunden sein als sie es je waren und die olympischen spiele von peking
7337345 i believe so its really a day to day situation right now
7337346 just from my past experiences with things like this i didnt feel anything different than what i was thinking that it was just a sprain
7337347 its just one of those things that when you have an injury after the game you get a little sore after that it starts feeling a lot better
7337348 i just have to see how it goes here over the next couple of weeks and ill have a better feel for it
7337349 what oahu and maui used to be 50 years ago
7337350 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid clinton as the vice presidential pick of the party
7337351 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth on his plans the truth hurt and obama didnt like it
7337352 he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him
7337353 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7337354 el equipo econ mico del presidente leonel fern ndez aunque hay personas ah muy buenas luce cansado y sin ideas por eso aplic la sugerencia del fmi de aumentar la tasa de inter s
7337355 el presidente debe en lo inmediato someter las finanzas p blicas a un plan estricto de austeridad urgente verdadero y cre ble para lo cual debe hacer como el ex presidente joaqu n balaguer abrir una cuenta en el banco central en la cual debe depositar 2 mil millones mensuales y congelarlos
7337356 ser fea no es un requisito para convertirse en monja la belleza externa es un regalo de dios y no debemos ocultarlo
7337357 no vamos a hacer desfilar a las monjas en traje de ba o
7337358 pero ser fea no es un requisito para convertirse en monja la belleza externa es un regalo de dios y no debemos ocultarlo
7337359 las monjas est n un poco excluidas est n un poco marginadas en la vida eclesi stica
7337360 esta ser una ocasi n para hacer que su contribuci n sea m s visible
7337361 votar por la monja a la que consideren una modelo
7337362 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7337363 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7337364 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7337365 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7337366 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7337367 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7337368 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7337369 memang benar jika kami telah kehilangan satu sosok yang penting bagi klub sebab sejauh ini performanya telah menunjukkan progres yang cukup signifikan yang membuatnya pantas menjadi salah satu kandidat lini depan tim namun mengingat komposisi yang kami miliki kami tidak akan tergesa gesa mencari sosok pengganti kone
7337370 kami memiliki sejumlah pemain yang mumpuni setidaknya kami memiliki lima pemain di lini depan seperti frederic kanoute luis fabiano renato ernesto chevanton dan lautero acosta
7337371 proceed from the view that in order to be respected we must use brute force
7337372 if the situation which exists now stays the same oil production will start to decline seriously in 2 yrs
7337373 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7337374 the olympics have increased chinese peoples confidence at first there was a lot of criticism but since the opening ceremony and the start of the games theres been widespread praise and this comes in a year where our confidence was shaken by natural disasters and other events
7337375 china is trying to show to the world this face that they are a modern progressing country thats open access for everyone and it really is not the truth the real face is one that denies freedom of speech that denies it brutally and violently when it can
7337376 perhaps some of the western governments and human rights organizations had it backwards where they expected that the olympics would be a time for more freedom
7337377 i think the government and i think theres substantial popular support for this view view the olympics in a very different way as a time to have temporary controls on society
7337378 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7337379 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7337380 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7337381 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7337382 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7337383 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7337384 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7337385 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7337386 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7337387 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7337388 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7337389 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7337390 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7337391 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7337392 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7337393 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7337394 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7337395 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7337396 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7337397 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7337398 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7337399 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7337400 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7337401 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7337402 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7337403 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7337404 we have reached the ultimate limit it cannot reasonably go any higher
7337405 reducing by 25 per cent the cost of rentals in all senegalese main and secondary cities his suggestion was not heeded
7337406 its not rare to rent a small single room at fcfa 40 or 50 000 sh11 400 per month or the most insignificant house or two bed room flat at 150 000 sh34 200
7337407 you cant have in paris the type of projects we have here in the french capital they have built everything a century or two ago here in dakar we have a nation under construction
7337408 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7337409 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7337410 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7337411 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7337412 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7337413 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7337414 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7337415 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7337416 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7337417 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7337418 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7337419 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7337420 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7337421 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7337422 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7337423 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7337424 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7337425 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7337426 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7337427 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7337428 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7337429 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7337430 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7337431 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7337432 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7337433 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7337434 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7337435 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7337436 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7337437 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7337438 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7337439 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7337440 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7337441 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7337442 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7337443 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7337444 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7337445 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7337446 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7337447 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7337448 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7337449 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7337450 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7337451 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7337452 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7337453 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7337454 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7337455 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7337456 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7337457 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7337458 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7337459 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7337460 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7337461 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7337462 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7337463 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7337464 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7337465 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7337466 this is a planning took where all things are going
7337467 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7337468 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7337469 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7337470 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7337471 in 2008 the minimum per seat annual contribution ranges from 50 for the cheap seats to 1 750 for box seats plus another 1 000 at least if youd like to park a car
7337472 le cheval sest assis sur le thorax du cavalier pour se redresser il a donn un coup de rein et lui a enfonc la cage thoracique

7337476 yes we are looking at him but there is no deal yet
7337477 my general manager is out there at the moment having a look he played yesterday
7337478 it is a possibility and there might be something happening but i am very very pleased with what we have got and what we have done
7337479 i would love here genuinely to buy british and young british like i did with lee cattermole
7337480 then you wouldnt have the problem of them flying to honduras and mexico city on international duty when they are away for days people say that you should know that when you sign them but i have no choice
7337481 i didnt like to have to go to cairo to get egypt international striker amr zaki but when you see him play you can see it was worth it
7337482 its very disappointing for darragh darragh is a very passionate player
7337483 he has given fantastic service as an amateur player to this game unfortunately he gets targeted and blamed and painted with different brushes all his career
7337484 it was disappointing for him today to get sent off
7337485 players in all games are targeted but for some players certain players are pencilled out because of their talent or because of their inspiration
7337486 were still in the championship nothing has changed it would have been nice to finish the job today but it wasnt to be and i mean thats sport we felt in control but cork are always likely to create some chances and obviously they did that
7337487 the board have accepted the bid hes not renegotiated his contract and the decision was taken out of my hands
7337488 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7337489 we are thin on the ground if we lose another defender we will have to react to that
7337490 one hundred fifty and with a lens to boot whats wrong with it
7337491 nothing except that the lens looks as cloudy as the nicest day in beijing
7337492 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

7337497 made himself a multi millionaire after he entered public life
7337498 it could well still be staged in pakistan but the board decided today that if there are doubts four five or six months ahead of the due date of october next year then the board would seek to relocate it
7337499 it was considered but dismissed very rapidly quite simply because there was no longer sufficient lead time to relocate the event in the same time frame
7337500 three countries had indicated to me privately ahead of south africas decision that they would not be able to send a squad for reasons of safety and security
7337501 but what they didnt realize is that the food they were taking pictures of was a collection of the most unappetizing piles of garbage you wouldnt feed to a dying hamster
7337502 the winner will get to perform with the group on stage during a one off concert but the girls hope theyll be able to discover a hidden talent who could join the band as a fully paid up member

7337524 new documents released under the freedom of information act reveal the official complacency that allowed the russian spy to be sprung from wormwood scrubs in 1966
7337525 that in may 1964 the prison authorities were alerted to an alleged attempt to spring blake
7337526 has a history of mental instability is incapable of dissociating fact and fantasy
7337527 the escape plot was a figment of blanks psychopathic tendencies he may even have gone to the length of approaching blake
7337528 you did similarly and you did it even worse you did not even allow auditor generals reports
7337529 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy

7337623 i dont see how it is improper for secularist organizations to characterize this as a religiously motivated effort just because the effort might also be supported by a secularist
7337624 the texts of sacred scripture never address the question of deliberate abortion and so do not directly and specifically condemn it
7337625 from the time that the ovum is fertilized a life is begun which is neither that of the father nor the mother it is rather the life of a new human being with his own growth it would never be made human if it were not human already this has always been clear and modern genetic science offers clear confirmation it has demonstrated that from the first instant there is established the programme of what this living being will be a person this individual person with his characteristic aspects already well determined right from fertilization the adventure of a human life begins and each of its capacities requires time a rather lengthy time to find its place and to be in a position to act
7337626 a valuable indication for discerning by the use of reason a personal presence at the moment of the first appearance of a human life how could a human individual not be a human person
7337627 cannot be provisional and changeable majority opinions but only the acknowledgment of an objective moral law which as the natural law written in the human heart is the obligatory point of reference for civil law itself
7337628 in no sphere of life can the civil law take the place of conscience or dictate norms concerning things which are outside its competence

7337640 despite last januarys cancellation of the annual golden globe awards due to the writers guild strike that curtailed the hollywood foreign press associations income were delighted to honor our ongoing commitment to support entertainment industry related film school and non profit organizations over the past several years the hollywood foreign press association foundation has presented more than 7 5 million in financial grants to dozens of film schools and non profit organizations
7337641 the hollywood foreign press association knows well philanthropys great dichotomy that if you publicize your efforts youre vilified for grandstanding while if you keep quiet about your good deeds they may go unnoticed the org is best known for the annual golden globe awards yet the hfpa also is a generous benefactor to many charities associated with film education

7337652 i also have a theater in my basement and backyard
7337653 for many years i would go to the rest homes in fremont and entertain them with old black and white movies like charlie chaplin
7337654 word got around and kept spreading ive been as far as center nebraska about 300 miles round trip

7337656 you cant have the lights off with people swimming though its not safe
7337657 we got to get the license for a public performance its pretty expensive for just one show

7337659 i was working at the fremont drive in when the screen flipped over during a tornado
7337660 i used to make 16mm films back in high school
7337661 admission was 25 cents and 15 cents for military personnel
7337662 i got out in 1963 and i just stayed here and worked for marcus theaters previously douglas theaters in omaha
7337663 i have worked in just about every theater in omaha
7337664 i still work one day a week at the 20 grand if i want to do it on my time off
7337665 i walk roughly three or four miles on a shift
7337666 i still develop 16 mm motion picture film in my basement for other people
7337667 there are a lot of film collectors in the united states
7337668 at one time i had about 600 print films in my basement now my dvd collection is growing
7337669 in the past six years the outdoor movie thing has really exploded
7337670 people are looking for new ways to experience movies and get a sense of community that big theaters and drive ins used to offer not like what you get at a multiplex at the mall where it first started was in communities that didnt have the demographics to build a theater theyd do it outdoors
7337671 you dont really notice that its smaller it dominates your view
7337672 we see this industry coming we see the payments coming in
7337673 my sisters and brothers wont even talk to me anymore
7337674 if the farmers non participation is a result of a physical consideration low lying land setback problems etc
7337675 experience suggests its easier to situate large clusters of wind turbines in western wisconsin than in eastern wisconsin even though the wind resource is more energetic along the niagara escarpment in the eastern half of the state siting turbines is a more delicate process there due to smaller farm sizes and higher population densities furthermore in western wisconsin local governments tend to be more receptive to farming constituency priorities than in the east owing in large part to agricultures importance to the western wisconsin economy there is also a higher proportion of farmers serving on local and county boards in that part of the state developers would be well advised to consider the trade offs between costs of a simpler permitting process in lower wind resource regions and the expense of development in a higher wind area with a more difficult time consuming and expensive permitting process
7337676 when the research for this report was first started we assumed the best development strategy is to be as open as possible this included holding multiple informational meetings reaching out to people and sharing as much data as possible current wisdom suggests that developers need to identify willing land owners and discuss permitting concerns with local government officials before making a public announcement
7337677 there were a couple of times when they told us to just shut up
7337678 my sisters and brothers wont even talk to me anymore
7337679 we have no comment on specifics but we want to be clear noble supports open and transparent development of wind projects in accordance with the highest ethical standards
7337680 i feel as a mother as a grandmother that the country needs it not just here
7337681 we see this industry coming we see the payments coming in
7337682 there is no decision you are going to make that is going to make everyone happy
7337683 my husband and i were walking along waikiki beach and came upon a large screen and vendors selling popcorn
7337684 we have our our town events its along the same lines
7337685 its a great way for families to get out together
7337686 its a scary prospect to put turbines in here among all the homes
7337687 local governments should still have a say in the matter
7337688 they said we didnt have the right to pass our own ordinance
7337689 but as the chairman of the assembly committee on energy and utilities i have a responsibility to meet state criteria and have statewide policies in place
7337690 we need a statewide policy or nobodys going to want to come develop wind farms here
7337691 he says his head feels like its spinning 100 mph not just from the sound but the shadows flickering on his walls
7337692 im just angry state officials have let it get to this point working in the garden used to be relaxing
7337693 frankly id rather have a nuclear power plant three quarters of a mile away
7337694 i mean if you want to see a train wreck and something that would just shut the state down economically itd be having to have developers and companies go through 3 000 plus governing bodies to get their projects done
7337695 but you get these developers coming in and they sit on the boards and committees drawing up the rules
7337696 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
7337697 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbour against neighbour father against son
7337698 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
7337699 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
7337700 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
7337701 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
7337702 why shouldnt we help kids in poor urban areas of new york make films lets see their films
7337703 the school is like the high school for the performing arts but its for cinema the goal is to build a magnet school right now its this after school program in the bronx thats spreading to public schools in other boroughs
7337704 some of the films are fantastical some of them are really funny some are really gritty and urban but by no means are they just stereotypically from the streets one kid made a really funny movie using a stuffed squirrel that was terrorizing a house it was this really simple kind of filmmaking that i could do with my own kids
7337705 it was even more disturbing to realize that 50 of all films made in america before 1950 sound and silent were gone
7337706 we were able to get the archivists into the front offices of the studios and begin a program of systematic restoration of all the major titles in the vaults
7337707 and because visual language today is so important much more than ever its essential for them to understand how to express themselves using the grammar of film as opposed to the grammar of advertising which is something very different made with a very different purpose
7337708 why does it seem so immediate when it was made 57 years ago
7337709 you can start by examining the writing the acting the lighting the framing the use of music and then the political context of 1950 51 when that film was made you can learn a great deal about the history of america at that point and understand how whats going on outside the movie can inform the action the story choices the emphases and it gives you a way of looking at our own period the one were in right now seeing the similarities and the differences
7337710 imagine that you have just survived walking thousands of miles your life at risk every minute of that time you manage to get to a refugee camp and you have nothing to do you dont know what your future holds
7337711 would it be crazy to bring screenings into refugee camps
7337712 we had an audience of tens of thousands of people watching charlie chaplin films and the wizard of oz
7337713 but in addition to feeding their imaginations we realized that they needed information on land mine awareness so we showed this psa on land mines
7337714 when youve got 70 90 or 100 000 people in a refugee camp there is no internet no phone no blackberry to communicate but a big movie screen does communicate its very old fashioned but very effective
7337715 the president and i came up with this four week summer course where we pull 32 kids from these impoverished neighborhoods and give them the education and tools to become filmmakers
7337716 whats great about this program is that you dont have just a group of kids all of whom want to become directors
7337717 these students want to work in the wardrobe department the camera department the editorial department as well as wanting to write and direct
7337718 one young womans first gig was in the wardrobe department on national treasure
7337719 now shes in the union shes now a costumer and the only reason shes there is because people want her this is a career and a life she has something shes good at something she worked hard to learn
7337720 before i got started in the inner city filmmakers program my confidence was low and i was a very quiet person
7337721 this program has opened so many doors and led me to so many opportunities i wouldnt have heard of without it
7337722 they called the program a film family and thats what it feels like to me
7337723 i view film as a form of art now which i couldnt say i did prior to this program
7337724 since joining this program i now know what its like to write a script make storyboards and various other things to make your film better my concept was to write a movie and shoot it and they have given me the fundamentals that i can use on future filmmaking projects
7337725 there are very few old drive in theaters left anymore
7337726 we couldnt wait until the weather got better so we could show people our movie screen
7337727 we hope we can help people learn to enjoy outdoor movies again
7337728 wed be willing to go anywhere in the state to set up
7337729 the cnc asked us to charge because they considered that it was unfair competition towards the cinemas around the parc de la villette
7337730 they wanted us to charge then we could decide the amount of money they didnt ask us to give them money they asked us to charge so that people would not only decide to go see movies because its free its a symbolic two euros that was foisted on us by the cnc
7337731 the public was not alerted and we were told it just was going to be that way
7337732 when local theatres show classic movies its late at night
7337733 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7337734 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7337735 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region

7337772 sometime last week there was a skirmish after spla attacked our positions
7337773 we thought that was a mistake but today they repeated it when they attacked lra at nabanga
7337774 we need to seek the most compassionate way of weeding out people
7337775 to allow unrestrained fertility is not pro life she said
7337776 a good gardener weeds and thins his seedlings to allow the proper amount of room for the plants to grow properly we need to seek the most compassionate way of weeding out people our current pro life movement is really killing people through disease and poverty she said in place of the pro life movement we need to develop the spirituality of recycling proposed ruether a spirituality that includes ourselves in the renewal of earth and self we need to compost ourselves

7337782 we are thin on the ground if we lose another defender we will have to react to that
7337783 its very disappointing for darragh darragh is a very passionate player
7337784 he has given fantastic service as an amateur player to this game unfortunately he gets targeted and blamed and painted with different brushes all his career
7337785 it was disappointing for him today to get sent off
7337786 players in all games are targeted but for some players certain players are pencilled out because of their talent or because of their inspiration
7337787 were still in the championship nothing has changed it would have been nice to finish the job today but it wasnt to be and i mean thats sport we felt in control but cork are always likely to create some chances and obviously they did that

7337803 canada has a choice when it comes to defending our sovereignty in the arctic either we use it or we lose it
7337804 and make no mistake this government intends to use it because canadas arctic is central to our identity as a northern nation it is part of our history and it represents the tremendous potential of our future
7337805 it shows once again that sovereignty over the north and sovereignty in our arctic is going to be an important issue as we move into the future
7337806 this government has put a real emphasis on northern and arctic sovereignty and we will continue to do so and we will move quickly in that regard
7337807 the pitiful thing is that this site cannot ever hope to hold a candle to sda for traffic

7337814 we were feeling really good because wed found a house and we came back and felt the air rushing through the room the children were the first to realise what had happened
7337815 it was heartbreaking wed just secured a home and then that happened
7337816 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7337817 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7337818 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7337819 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7337820 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
7337821 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7337822 people who know me know that im not a shrinking violet
7337823 i didnt sign up to be the guy who plays the harlem globetrotters
7337824 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
7337825 being on fox is like going into the second room
7337826 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7337827 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7337828 i came out in a sweatshirt and nikes i thought we were going to play basketball
7337829 i put all my traditional beliefs behind me and was heavily into drugs
7337830 he urged me to get back on the spiritual path
7337831 we ask the creator to come and heal us from that
7337832 back in the day before you went to war or out on the warpath there were ceremonies to prepare you
7337833 there were ceremonies that cleansed you when you came home so you didnt bring negativity back to your tribe
7337834 beliefs and rituals are what we used to deal with traumatic things that happened
7337835 it kept us healthy for hundreds and thousands of years
7337836 it empowers them to go out and format themselves in a different way
7337837 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7337838 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7337839 it doesnt matter what people do to me im still going to fight for what is right
7337840 gm is one of the biggest companies here in the state theyve been forced to downsize and its really affecting our community so people need to be retrained with new skills to get new jobs

7337854 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
7337855 it is easy to ignore the storm if you look at the opposite horizon when the storm reaches your location there can be no more ignorance
7337856 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7337857 i am so glad and so happy to be able to be here like this after such a bad result in hungary
7337858 the car was great especially in the second stint and the team were great too to take pole position to win the race and to have the fastest lap you cannot ask for more after such a result in budapest
7337859 i have had flu symptoms and a fever nearly every day i had low energy and i had problems with spasms in my neck
7337860 pedro de la rosa the teams test and reserve driver was on standby but i managed to get through it even though it was tough
7337861 i felt like i couldnt drive it i lost the steering a lot for two corners before it came back and i lost some confidence in the car
7337862 so i am glad to be third it is a good result for the team
7337863 it is an issue for us because we have had some problems in the first race in the last one and in this one
7337864 an ordeal that was bearable only because they held onto the hope of ascending into the heaven of gaining permanent positions
7337865 should american workers expect better treatment they have to own homes send their kids to college have late model cars and big tvs what for the global economy is a cut throat deal and the us worker had better learn to be satisfied with less
7337866 well youll have to work in qa for a year or so but if youre good well allow you to escape
7337867 nate came into the office every day right up to his final days
7337868 i kidded him about being my most conscientious faculty member he kidded me about being the prettiest dean hed ever had and the only one hed ever kissed on the cheek of course he was devoted to his work and to stanford it is hard to imagine the school without him
7337869 teaching is properly done by hunch by intuition by experience by ideology what it also needs is a basis in scientific research
7337870 gages empirical work and his theoretical defense of scientific research on teaching have been tenacious and are in no small part the basis of our contemporary faith that there is a role for traditional science in educational research in particular and the social sciences in general
7337871 it is professor gages achievements as an empirical scientist and as a defender of the role of science in education that brings him the respect of the community of educational psychologists but i think that he is honored in our field as well for his decency humor affection unfailing optimism and for his mentoring of and friendship with many other scholars in the field
7337872 at that time people werent accepting jews into graduate schools
7337873 ability to bridge the gap between the complex theory of educational psychology and the insistent practical demands of the classroom
7337874 it structured the field of research on teaching directed attention to important topics influenced the research agenda for a decade and affected government funding for the next 20 years
7337875 its substantive contributions to research on teaching were many but in some way its major products were well trained psychologically oriented personnel
7337876 in his hesitant voice nate said id like to comment on something i heard last year i think it was by one of my students
7337877 and ron marx phd 78 a professor at the university of arizona interjected were all your students nate
7337878 my dad loved to have fun and he loved to laugh
7337879 he had a certain number of things he repeated again and again so much so that we started repeating them and one of his greatest joys was that his children were following his example
7337880 he would always say that in illinois where he had come from you could drive 30 minutes and be in danville but here you could drive 30 miles and be in san francisco

7337886 dont you know that 75 percent of the world is covered by water and the other 25 percent is covered by zont
7337887 there are a lot of aspects that i think fit with me
7337888 the discipline and details of it the trust that comes into this i think those are things that suit me it has been hard the year to year to year learning of a new system hopefully you get to the point where you stick with something for a little bit at least master it and get to a level where you can play at a really high level thats the goal
7337889 this assessment should lay to rest the idea that draining the bay areas main source of water warrants further study particularly in a state that needs more water and more clean power not less
7337890 the state has declared that this can be done thats something a lot of people have been reluctant to admit for a long time
7337891 from what we have now we dont see anything that says it cant be done
7337892 draining the reservoir would be far too expensive and leave the state vulnerable to both drought and blackout
7337893 this study confirms that it is within our reach to restore yosemite valleys lost twin without compromising californias long term water and power supply
7337894 it really gets over the hurdle of you cant do it

7337906 it isnt a question of what senator obama needs hes the full package

7337927 including the origins of the solar system and earth move on to the creation of water life and the explanation of darwinian evolution including mammal primate and human evolution we will have road signs and pods off the main pathway through the museum showing how these developments are all connected
7337928 this is a new approach to natural history and we are very excited by it
7337929 we want this institution to become a resource for the community and catapult its assets in front of the world at large for education and research purposes

7337937 es ist nur der schreck gewesen es ist nichts passiert
7337938 du bist bescheuert mein einziges t shirt dass ich noch von europa besitze hast du nun zerst rt
7337939 die sind meist schlecht drauf wenn man merkt dass sie ungewollte g ste sind
7337940 wie bist du berhaupt an bord gekommen du wusstest doch berhaupt nicht wann ich aufbrechen wollte und was gedenkst du nun zu tun ich hab immerhin nicht gen gend proviant f r zwei personen dabei warum wolltest du berhaupt mit
7337941 hast du wirklich gedacht ich w rde von nun an auf ganymed in einer zweitklassigen bar arbeiten da hast du dich aber geh rig geschnitten
7337942 nachdem du dich gestern abend schlafen gelegt hast hab ich mich an bord der chakotay geschlichen nat rlich habe ich proviant f r mich dabei ich bin ja nicht bl d
7337943 mir ist auch ganz egal wo wir jetzt hinfliegen hauptsache wir treiben diese d mlichen piraten auf und erledigen sie damit ich endlich wieder nach europa kann
7337944 dass du im ernst noch daran glaubst diese piraten zu finden und sie dingfest zu machen
7337945 m dchen die welt hier drau en ist nicht so leicht und einfach wie du es in deiner naivit t gewohnt bist hier gibt es eine riesige anzahl an kriminellen und den meisten wird wohl nie jemand auf die schliche kommen
7337946 stell dir nur mal vor wir w rden die verantwortlichen wieder finden was sollten wir dann tun sie einbuchten und ordentlich kohle verdienen na meinetwegen und wie geht es dann weiter ich sag es dir ihr bande wird uns suchen und uns finden und dann bezahlen wir mit unserem leben
7337947 dann finden wir sie und machen die internationale sicherheit auf sie aufmerksam
7337948 wenn die sicherheit eine chance gegen die piraterie h tte dann w rde sie nie in diesem ausma existieren und der beruf des kopfgeldj gers rentiert sich genau deswegen weil es hier drau en so viele verbrecher gibt
7337949 wenn es so w re wie du es sagst dann w rde die interplanetare kriminalit t viel mehr anklang in der presse finden die politik und die weltregierung w rden eine solch gro e kriminalit tsrate niemals zulassen
7337950 du bersch tzt die weltregierung und die sicherheit geh rig
7337951 wie auch immer ich habe keine lust weiter ber dein verbl mtes weltbild zu diskutieren ich werde jetzt bei chris anrufen und dann drehen wir um und bringen dich zur ck
7337952 chris was hast du dir gedacht du wusstest dass ich keine begleiter auf meinen reisen haben will
7337953 ach jason sie wollte so gern mit dir kommen und hier in der bar w re sie doch nie gl cklich geworden
7337954 du wei t genauso gut wie ich dass ihr etwas zusto en kann wenn die piraten sie erwischen

7337971 a scaled down plan will not be welcomed in communities that were promised fastracks service longmont thornton and brighton are shut out entirely but the northwest rail line in particular never made any fiscal sense it and others with the lowest ridership and highest subsidies should be the first to go rtd should concentrate on the lines that are most fiscally defensible taxpayers are already digging deeply enough
7337972 you can just about bet that theres gonna be a body found in the woods or
7337973 having tasted slavutich and lvivske here in canada i wanted to see firsthand how it was made
7337974 and i wanted to assess the potential for a beer lovers tour of ukraine
7337975 in fact the lvivske brewery hosts ukraines only museum of brewing and its tasting cellar is home to lvivs most popular restaurant the brewery even has a chapel in which services are conducted for employees and water is blessed for the beer
7337976 contrary to the old simplistic notion that art and music are processed in the right hemisphere of our brains with language and mathematics in the left recent findings from my laboratory and those of my colleagues are showing us that music is distributed throughout the brain through studies of people with brain damage weve seen patients who have lost the ability to read a newspaper but can still read music or individuals who can play the piano but lack the motor coordination to button their own sweater music listening performance and composition engage nearly every area of the brain that we have so far identified and involve nearly every neural subsystem could this fact account for claims that music listening exercises other parts of our minds that listening to mozart twenty minutes a day will make us smarter
7337977 the findings are astounding neuroscientists have discovered that even thinking about playing the piano can enhance the structure of your brains tactile and motor sections the equivalent holds true when focusing on kindness and compassion
7337978 human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted

7337982 today was a celebration and a show of national pride that the olympics is coming to the uk in four years time
7337983 i think we should all be celebrating its fantastic that the games are coming to the uk
7337984 we wanted as many people as possible to join in the handover celebrations
7337985 that very week i had been toying with the idea of blogging going so far as to have set up an as yet unpublished first post
7337986 blogs and wikis are now becoming mainstream communication tools but who in the department of the navy is actually using them
7337987 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel
7337988 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
7337989 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
7337990 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
7337991 there are instantaneous communications taking place around the world and we need to figure out how to take advantage of that opportunity instead of looking at it as a nemesis
7337992 you can call it strategic communication you can call it information engagement i like to call it operating in the information domain of the 21st century

7338004 hillary disse v rias vezes que barack obama e ela compartilham o compromisso de mudar o rumo do pa s de tirar os eua do iraque e de ampliar o acesso assist ncia m dica

7338009 in rhode island the enforceability of a premarital agreement is governed by the uniform premarital agreement act as codified in 15 17 6 section 15 17 6 states a a premarital agreement is not enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves that 1 that party did not execute the agreement voluntarily and 2 the agreement was unconscionable when it was executed and before execution of the agreement that party i was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party ii did not voluntarily and expressly waive in writing any right to disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party beyond the disclosure provided and iii did not have or reasonably could not have had an adequate knowledge of the property or financial obligations of the other party b the burden of proof as to each of the elements required in order to have a premarital agreement held to be unenforceable shall be on the party seeking to have the agreement declared unenforceable and must be proven by clear and convincing evidence c if a provision of a premarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support and that modification or elimination causes one party to the agreement to be eligible for support under a program of public assistance at the time of separation or marital dissolution a court notwithstanding the terms of the agreement may require the other party to provide support to the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility d an issue of unconscionability of a premarital agreement shall be decided by the court as a matter of law
7338010 we have noted that when the legislature enacted the provisions of 15 17 6 it clearly evidenced the intent to preserve the validity of such agreements and maintain the integrity of such agreements
7338011 to that end the legislature placed a significant burden upon the party seeking to render the agreement unenforceable that party must prove all of the elements in 15 17 6 a 1 and 2 and must do so by clear and convincing evidence
7338012 we are satisfied that 15 17 6 b unambiguously provides that t he burden of proof as to each of the elements required in order to have a premarital agreement held to be unenforceable shall be on the party seeking to have the agreement declared unenforceable
7338013 the trial justice found that each asset david listed was unaccompanied by a dollar value nor was there a written waiver of debras right to disclosure of the value of her husbands property and his financial obligations
7338014 there is no information contained in this agreement as to the values of any of mr marsoccis assets

7338019 it is a total disgrace this proud night for britain has been sullied by this grotesque representation of london
7338020 clearly whoever was responsible must be found and fired immediately
7338021 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7338022 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7338023 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7338024 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7338025 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect

7338029 you know hes a very smart guy i cant speak for me but i know for me that it was a learning experience i worked very hard im sure hes working very hard too ive watched seven presidents and ive watched presidents who have come to office who havent thought through some of the areas that theyve never worked in for example foreign policy i watched several presidents come in and theyre smart as the devil and they get here and unless you already know when you get here exactly what your foreign policy is its awful hard to hit the ground running and not to make serious mistakes the first couple of years im not saying that senator obama is where i was when elected to the senate at age 29 i was younger than he was when he got to the senate but i do think i acknowledge that experience is not the issue its whether your experience has been good or bad somebody with 34 years of bad experience isnt perfectly qualified to be president someone with 34 years of good experience that makes a big difference so again i know its kind of difficult to master its kind of difficult to feel sure footed in a lot of areas that you havent spent a long of time dealing with

7338036 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7338037 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7338038 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7338039 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7338040 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7338041 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7338042 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7338043 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7338044 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7338045 religious persons acquire religious ideas and practices through social exposure the child of a zen buddhist will not become an evangelical christian without the relevant cultural experience while mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook nevertheless some exposure is required one single person cannot invent a complex religious system like roman catholism however simpler religious cults can be created by an individual like scientology which was made up by a fantasy fiction writer
7338046 if all thought is computationally structured then such an approach computational analysis mentioned earlier in the wiki can also shed light on the nature of religious cognition
7338047 national candidates tend to be more savvy and lock up their domain names early
7338048 savvy forward thinking public figures generally have gotten ahead of this and own web sites associated with their public person they either bought it early before they were famous or later negotiated to buy it
7338049 i was contacted by someone representing the kerry campaign the day after they announced edwards was going to join the ticket they asked me if i was interested in loaning or donating the domain to the campaign i told them no and that i had been offered 10 000 for the domain already which i had the conversation ended and i never heard from them again
7338050 websites are important vehicles to provide information to constituents and to boost participation in the political process
7338051 in the wrong hands a web address can be used to mislead and misrepresent a public officials record that is why i am extremely grateful that pool com allowed me the opportunity to renew my domain and ensure that the information on the page reflects my values and beliefs
7338052 last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7338053 the team showed an intensity and mentality we want to see last year we were losing or drawing these types of games and we have to win them our fans were quiet before we scored and they were thinking about last season but in the end we showed a winning mentality and so maybe this will send a positive message to the fans this is the kind of determination we want to see for the rest of the season
7338054 we know steve is not 100 percent fit but he showed his quality to win the game carragher was amazing because normally he isnt a great finisher after that gerrard showed his quality too even though he isnt 100 percent fit he can change games
7338055 i think carra will claim it sami was joking with him saying it was a deflection but at the end of the day we won and thats the most important thing
7338056 when you are kicking towards that kop end you can feel them helping you and helping the team
7338057 we have been working on having a positive mentality and trying to kill off the lesser teams and we finally got the breakthrough thanks to jamie carragher yes i was surprised because he doesnt get many but it was a good shot even though it got a deflection
7338058 i would say i am only about 70 or 80 percent at the moment but i am working hard on the training ground to get to the level i want to be at
7338059 football is about winning it doesnt matter how well you play so long as you come off the pitch having picked up the points
7338060 well if id had the shot id be claiming it thats for sure
7338061 it was nice to play my first competitive game at anfield but at the end of the day the most important thing was to win
7338062 it was a frustrating game but they made it hard for us and you have to give credit to middlesbrough
7338063 i think we worked well today and i really enjoyed the game obviously winning the match makes you happy but in terms of how we linked up i thought we played well together and hopefully there will be more to come from us as a strike partnership im not too concerned about getting that first goal people keep going on about it and seem more bothered about it than me i know itll come and as long as the team is winning thats the most important thing for everyone involved weve got two wins out of two in the league and thats all you can ask for
7338064 weve given two good performances against two top teams and thats given me a lot of belief and the players have got to believe
7338065 we showed away from home against a top team we can be disciplined and cause problems with our counter attacks
7338066 we had no fear of liverpool the improvement from 12 months ago is light years once they got the equaliser maybe an element of fatigue and a desire to protect what we had rebounded on the players
7338067 i havent heard anything good about the us olympic coverage but thats
7338068 why the hell put quotes around right anyway you already have a modifier in the

7338100 get off your cross and use the wood to build a bridge to get over yourselves
7338101 a common strand appeared to unite these conflicts and that was the advancement of a small coteries concept of american interests in the guise of the fight against terrorism which was defined to refer only to the organized and politically motivated killing of civilians by killers not wearing the uniforms of soldiers i recognized that if this was to be the single most important priority of our species then the lives of those of us who lived in the lands in which such killers also lived had no meaning except collateral damage this i reasoned was why america felt justified in bringing so many deaths to afghanistan and iraq and why americans felt justified in risking so many more deaths by tacitly using india to pressure pakistan
7338102 it was always intended to end as it does for me the reader is a character in a novel and the way one reads it shapes the outcome so a reader who is more suspicious of pakistanis might read it differently from one who is more suspicious of americans but it is the fear we are all being fed the sense that something menacing lurks in the shadows of our world that has the potential to make the novel a thriller in reality we should be much less frightened of our world than we are when two people meet and disagree on this planet the result is almost invariably a conversation nothing more and nothing less
7338103 do your employees work for you or do you work for your employees
7338104 its not a trick question really and i feel like i already know by what youve told me thus far
7338105 they work for me for sure i lead by example by word and by action i plan for the day with them in mind asking them to do that which suits them best either to their strengths or to challenge them in an opportunity area im in control and i tend to take charge but not in a domineering or overbearing way its just natural
7338106 unfortunately im not sure that our dealings with russia have mirrored the changes that have taken place there
7338107 and at the same time they have nursed a lot of grudges that having made a comeback and having achieved recovery they are still being treated like they were in 1995
7338108 i believe that in order to improve relations with russia it is necessary not to pull the former soviet republics into political military blocs but to develop relations with russia itself
7338109 and then the actions of the bloc in a few years will not be perceived so acutely in this country as is the case today
7338110 a lot of times in politics you have people look you in the eye and tell you whats not on their mind
7338111 he looks you in the eye and tells you whats on his mind hes been very truthful and to me thats the only way you can find common ground and to be able to deal in a way that you dont let your disputes interrupt your relationships
7338112 on these kinds of things as president kennedy did during the cuban missile crisis you deal with the points that are being made on the other side with which you can agree or with which you want to work
7338113 we all tend to believe that mr putin calls the main shots even if mr medvedev tends from time to time to look like a friendlier bear to deal with
7338114 it shows a mindset about russia that tends to see it through the neoconservative prism of basically being a soviet threat
7338115 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7338116 the olympics have increased chinese peoples confidence at first there was a lot of criticism but since the opening ceremony and the start of the games theres been widespread praise and this comes in a year where our confidence was shaken by natural disasters and other events
7338117 china is trying to show to the world this face that they are a modern progressing country thats open access for everyone and it really is not the truth the real face is one that denies freedom of speech that denies it brutally and violently when it can
7338118 perhaps some of the western governments and human rights organizations had it backwards where they expected that the olympics would be a time for more freedom
7338119 i think the government and i think theres substantial popular support for this view view the olympics in a very different way as a time to have temporary controls on society
7338120 the world learned about china and china learned about the world
7338121 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the xxix olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in

7338547 we are ready for talks with the government and the truce is an important development towards dialogue
7338548 we do not believe in their verbal commitments if they are sincere they should first surrender

7338551 i just thought about my mother riding bikes with us and it was the most ridiculous thing id ever imagined
7338552 the industry needs young journalists and others comfortable with digital to try new ideas and break from the norm and management needs to give us the leverage to try and fail before we ultimately try and succeed
7338553 my dream ticket would be obama and clinton preferably clinton first but seeing as thats not likely to happen now then id like her to be second together they cover a vast group of voters from all demographics
7338554 i supported clinton because of her economic and social security policies
7338555 i am a youth hispanic who supports hillary which is a rather rare demographic
7338556 everything that she has done and stands for is similar to what i aspire to be like its a great honor to represent the youth in denver as a national delegate
7338557 im excited about seeing so many big people im really excited about seeing how politics work on a national level as compared to the state level and local level im a little worried about the amount ofprotestors police that i saw in denver yesterday i hope that the speech at invesco field goes well and the weather is nice im also happy to be able to go to several events where i can possibly meet lots and lots of new people
7338558 my thoughts on biden he will add a lot of experience to baracks resume as a candidate however i feel that hillary would add just as much experience that senator biden does i also think that biden wont really help out a whole lot with crucial states whereas i think hillary would guarantee a big state like new york and greatly affect others like pennsylvania ohio and texas i understand that you shouldnt pick a vp based solely on the fact that they will help sway more states and win an election but there must be a reason or several for that matter that that person can and will sway those states as disappointed as i am that hillary wasnt his pick i think that biden will serve the u s as the vp well

7338629 what is 3g technology why is it popular among cell phones
7338630 the relative political stability we see across the continent coupled with the commodity supercycle over the past five years driven by china and india have been responsible for a growth rate better than in decades
7338631 this in turn can be coupled with the unbelievable growth that extends around the cellular companies and the development of communications generally we see our business which is more orientated towards corporations and governments than consumers as the next wave of communications across the continent
7338632 we are concentrating on markets where there is either a large consumer base that drives financial services uptake or in the commodity based markets oil and gas in particular where there are opportunities for us
7338633 weve gone into those markets and typically made a small acquisition
7338634 our experience and success has been in being relevant in the marketplace and bringing what we can from a global perspective
7338635 we also have businesses in europe and the us but we do not experience the slowdown in our emerging africa businesses as we see in some of these other markets we believe that the relatively low base that these markets are coming from means that they are not going to stall as possibly some other markets in the world have done we are growing the businesses rapidly and we dont foresee a material slowdown in that growth in the next 18 months to two years
7338636 but if you look at the expansion of our typical banking type institutions all of them are making real investments in these markets that significantly help us to de risk our payment mechanisms and financial situations we are used to dealing with each other and this de risks the situation from a payment and financial perspective
7338637 well probably have our most substantial base in angola where we currently have a business and we are also in namibia and botswana in this region for a total presence of 11 countries including sa

7338662 when you consider that it doesnt include another four years of secondary education plus five more years of medical school if he wants to follow his previously stated goal to grow up to be a doctor like his daddy this will come as an interminably deep chasm of drudgery and imprisonment to connor
7338663 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death

7338677 relying on the internet as a source of campaign information is strongly correlated with knowledge about the candidates and the campaign this is more the case than for other types of media even accounting for the fact that internet users generally are better educated and more interested politically and among young people under 30 use of the internet to learn about the campaign has a greater impact on knowledge than does level of education

7338768 im here to talk to georgian leaders and our u s assessment team to hear what they need
7338769 we have to get it right so we can help people quickly we want to optimize the humanitarian aid effort and bring in the right stuff to the right place at the right time
7338770 we express our gratitude for your help and will never forget what you have done to help us in our time of need
7338771 there is an agreement between two heads of state and there has to be compliance
7338772 my assessment is that the russian withdrawal is now slower than it ought to be the russians need to do what they said they were going to do almost a week ago and withdraw
7338773 we need to ensure that we learn the lessons of those two events and that we continue to strengthen an integrated process to defend ourselves against these kinds of intrusion
7338774 its critical to our mission that we are comfortable that we have a secure network that its resilient to probes and attacks and that it will be able to sustain good decision making for the nations leaders
7338775 all of those have to come together in a unified effort if we are to maintain adequate defense against those who might intrude to our networks and try to disrupt them its a big challenge
7338776 if you are going to be successful at defending it you have to have strong and close integration among the various agencies
7338777 because this is such a broad area and it touches so many different elements of our society business medical care information certainly military and economic many of those same organizations are struggling with how do you pull them together in a more coherent fashion
7338778 im not as worried that a cold war relationship is returning so much
7338779 those are things we have to pay attention to but i think it is important not to swing the pendulum too much in an alarmist fashion
7338780 i dont see a threat to the nation coming from the arctic
7338781 but i do see security concerns that will arise as you have nations compete for resources as you have nations compete for passage as you have commercial interests competing for passage through the area all of those have a security element and i think we just have to have a good discussion about it
7338782 if we believed we have solved the problem we are almost guaranteeing it will come back you cant take your eye off the ball in this kind of a situation
7338783 we are seeing a team now that is closer knit than maybe ever before
7338784 those days are gone we are working hand in hand
7338785 we are seeing now a synergy that is really strong
7338786 on any given day one of them will be our highest priority
7338787 what keeps me awake is making sure that our team is focused on the many threats out there and not taking any one for granted not leaving any one unobserved
7338788 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7338789 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7338790 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7338791 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7338792 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7338793 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7338794 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7338873 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7338874 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7338875 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7338876 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7338877 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7338878 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade

7338889 people are buzzing about concerning you people really this season came out of this feeling like you were a little bit of a bastard
7338890 i think im less of an a hole in this season
7338891 people read andy cohen are still obsessed with your beauty regiment and your face and your maintenance of your face
7338892 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7338893 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7338894 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7338895 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7338896 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7338897 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7338898 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7338899 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7338900 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7338901 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7338902 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7338903 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7338904 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7338905 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make

7338907 the incident involving car 2 will be investigated after the race
7338908 give us time to think of an excuse so we dont have to penalise ferrari
7338909 then not 1 maybe 2 laps at the most later more reliability issues with the f2008
7338910 it would all prove academic anyway for the unhappy raikkonen as the ferrari engine failed in dramatic style a few minutes later as he crossed the start finish line given these engine designs are frozen it is strange that ferrari have suddenly found reliability issues

7338928 the company can look at outsourcing hr functions prepaid and postpaid billing one of the other areas that can happen is when number portability is introduced where more sophisticated work like customer churn management and behavioural analytics is outsourced to predict the longevity of the customer
7338929 when they started outsourcing they bharti airtel were in a lower level of learning cycle now the company is little more advanced
7338930 these are vital elements for the customer on how we respond on how fast we resolve the issue what kind of redundancy we have what kind of disaster recovery

7338935 most often people realize how good a company is after leaving it unfortunately the last six months have not been very happy for me
7338936 the attrition rate has increased to 14 in 2008 up from 12 in the previous year and 8 9 in 2006 the companys split into the phone business and the non phone business is the main reason for attrition
7338937 we paid our employees an average increment of 12 13 with outstanding performers getting up to 18 20
7338938 often employees get to know these developments from newspaper reports and there is no internal communication employees then start speculating and this can lead to immense productivity loss and even revenue loss
7338939 it is mostly the employee who talks i try to direct the conversation

7338950 democratic delegates from michigan and florida were awarded full voting rights at the national convention sunday despite holding early primaries against party rules
7338951 t he legacy of theresa lepore the palm beach county elections chief who gave voters the
7338952 popular among seniors and jewish voters biden could be helpful to obama in florida and in states like pennsylvania and ohio where obama struggled during the primaries
7338953 he has been a huge supporter of israel and has been so in a very erudite fashion because he knows all the players not only in israel but in the palestinian authority
7338954 hes a true lunch bucket democrat its a perfect choice
7338955 a generation of democratic voters that sen obama is not doing as well with as he would like at this point would be very attracted to joe biden
7338956 barack obamas choice of joe biden as a running mate could give the ticket a boost in florida thanks to bidens ties to south florida including support among a cadre of influential democratic fundraisers
7338957 hes not likely to confuse sunnis and shiites or al qaida and hezbollah forget that czechoslovakia ceased to exist approximately 15 years ago or for all his verbal stumbles sing about bombing iran all of which john mccain an alleged foreign policy specialist did
7338958 after a long and contentious presidential primary season in which florida played a central role democrats hold their national convention this week with the aim of projecting strength and unity behind the first black presidential nominee of a major party
7338959 after enduring months of political exile florida democrats giddily find themselves back in the center of the political universe as they head to a history making convention
7338960 state compensation reports show u s sugar spent more to lobby the executive branch than any other company in the first half of 2008 the investment paid off in june when crist announced florida would buy out the company in a 1 75 billion transaction designed to help restore the everglades
7338961 republicans will decide in tuesdays primary who among four candidates will be the next district 31 state representative no democrats filed to run in the race to replace mitch needelman who faces term limits and a legal loophole will keep them and independents from voting because a write in candidate announced a campaign
7338962 hes exciting hes likeable hes a great campaigner but then what said miami lawyer ira leesfield a top clinton fundraiser who now supports obama but is no longer aggressively raising money obamas mission this week create comfort
7338963 unlike many televangelists and mega church preachers the rev warren has an admirable record of using his wealth and influence to fight poverty illiteracy and hiv aids he could have done the country a service by turning the interviews away from the abortion debate and toward some of the causes he has championed it doesnt take a theologian to ask politicians hard questions about the moral conduct of government agnostics or atheists can do the interviewing just as well
7338964 early voting for tuesdays primary election appears lower in hillsborough county than in the past but officials arent sure whether the drop signals a trend or a concession to mother nature
7338965 president bush declared sunday that four florida counties hit hardest by tropical storm fay are major disaster areas making them eligible for federal aid the declaration makes funds available for emergency work and repairs to governments in brevard monroe okeechobee and st lucie counties
7338966 it took gov crist lusting after a spot on the mccain ticket all of a day after sen mccains conversion to drop his opposition to more drilling floridas republican senator mel martinez now also wants further review of the offshore drilling issue those were attacks on florida from within and then the attacks got bipartisan
7338967 p olitical courage like oil can be hard to find
7338968 the st johns river could hit central florida this week with some of the worst flooding on record runoff from fay is gorging nearly every part of the 310 mile st johns river which forms south of melbourne and flows north to the orlando area and on to jacksonville
7338969 water district officials might open canal gates that allow water to flow from the upper reaches of the river to the indian river lagoon along the coast but thats an option of last resort because of significant environmental harm that results by dumping fresh water into a slightly salty ecosystem
7338970 and florida will be in the center of it all
7338971 floridas weather can make for dicey campaigning john kerry lost weeks of crucial florida campaign time during the treacherous hurricane season in 2004 and last week tropical storm fay took a toll on the john mccain and barack obama campaigns fay caused mccain to cancel a million dollar fundraiser in miami last week and the obama campaign pulled its tv ads across the state
7338972 floridas primary on tuesday is the one and only chance for voters to elect judges and to send party nominees into the general election in november
7338973 it took a lot of courage for a maitland housewife to say that particularly when the boss man worships at the feet of luminaries like charles krauthammer
7338974 in race to see who handles fiscal mess better florida leads california 1 0
7338975 is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7338976 in reality st marys south brisbane has taken a roman catholic parish and established its own brand of religion
7338977 undoubtedly it does good it promotes a strong sense of community opens its doors to all who wish to come but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic
7338978 im not particularly hopeful myself but its up to the community they will find the right solution
7338979 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7338980 john edwards wants you and all the democrats to think i want us out of there but when you come back and you say o k john what about the chaos that will ensue do we have any interest john left in the region well john will have to answer yes or no if he says yes what are they what are those interests john how do you protect those interests john if you are completely withdrawn are you withdrawn from the region john are you withdrawn from iraq john in what period so all this stuff is like so much fluffernutter out there
7338981 committed to denominational education and intended to remain a provider as long as parents choose catholic schools
7338982 there seemed to be a policy assumption in the department of education that every new school at secondary level should be multi denominational we dont accept that should be the case
7338983 relegate them to the past and seems to consign their role in school ownership to history
7338984 i feel that it is important to place on the record unambiguously what heretofore could be assumed but now needs to be expressly stated namely that the catholic church makes no apology for its ongoing presence in education delivery
7338985 the matters fall into the wider space of the planning for future school provision they will be considered along with the views of other patron interests and the wider education partners as future policy in this area evolves
7338986 catholic parents should always be free to send their children to catholic schools but those who do so in future may have to pay more for the privilege unless that is they believe the state should fund a comprehensive network of muslim sikh hindu and scientology schools as well
7338987 leuropa deve rivedere il patto di stabilit e dire s a un aumento del deficit
7338988 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7338989 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7338990 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7338991 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7338992 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7338993 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7338994 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7338995 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7338996 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7338997 rather than check the difference between 0 and false or use a more appropriate function the original developer just dropped the first letter of each crawler name so that strpos doesnt return 0
7338998 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7338999 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7339000 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7339001 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7339002 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7339003 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7339004 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7339005 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7339006 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7339007 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7339008 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7339009 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7339010 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7339011 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7339012 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7339013 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7339014 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7339015 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7339016 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7339017 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7339018 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7339019 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7339020 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7339021 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7339022 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7339023 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7339024 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7339025 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7339026 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7339027 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7339028 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7339029 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7339030 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7339031 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7339032 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7339033 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7339034 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7339035 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7339036 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7339037 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7339038 this is for my 78 year old lifelong democrat father who has already booked his ticket to fly out here in hopes of getting in
7339039 she wanted it for her mother who campaigned for kennedy and was browse a gallery of images from the dnc prepped pepsi center browse a gallery of images preparations parties and protests in advance of the convention view street closures alternative route info view street closures and protest parade route for aug 25 27 view protest parade route for thursday aug 28 wondering if id had any luck
7339040 i called all the people i knew in middle tennessee politics
7339041 no one had tickets they were sort of left out
7339042 i have worked for him so i put a little pressure there
7339043 i kept calling and they said no were blocked off for dnc week
7339044 i talked to a friend of mine who was a really good buddy of al gores and he said he was going to try to get me some way to get in the convention during the week
7339045 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7339046 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7339047 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7339048 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7339049 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7339050 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7339051 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7339052 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7339053 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7339054 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7339055 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7339056 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7339057 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7339058 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7339059 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7339060 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7339061 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7339062 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7339063 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7339064 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7339065 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7339066 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7339067 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7339068 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7339069 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7339070 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7339071 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7339072 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7339073 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7339074 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7339075 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7339076 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7339077 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7339078 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7339079 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7339080 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7339081 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7339082 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7339083 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7339084 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7339085 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7339086 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7339087 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7339088 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7339089 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7339090 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7339091 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7339092 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7339093 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7339094 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7339095 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7339096 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7339097 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7339098 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7339099 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7339100 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7339101 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7339102 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
7339103 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
7339104 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
7339105 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
7339106 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
7339107 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7339108 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7339109 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7339110 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7339111 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7339112 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7339113 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7339114 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7339115 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7339116 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7339117 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7339118 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7339119 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7339120 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7339121 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7339122 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7339123 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7339124 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7339125 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7339126 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7339127 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7339128 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7339129 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7339130 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7339131 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7339132 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7339133 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7339134 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7339135 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7339136 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7339137 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7339138 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7339139 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7339140 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7339141 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7339142 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7339143 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7339144 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7339145 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7339146 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7339147 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7339148 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7339149 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7339150 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7339151 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7339152 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7339153 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7339154 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7339155 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7339156 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7339157 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7339158 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7339159 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7339160 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7339161 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7339162 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7339163 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7339164 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7339165 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7339166 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7339167 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7339168 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7339169 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7339170 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7339171 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7339172 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7339173 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7339174 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7339175 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7339176 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7339177 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7339178 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7339179 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7339180 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7339181 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7339182 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7339183 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7339184 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7339185 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7339186 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7339187 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7339188 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7339189 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7339190 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7339191 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7339192 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7339193 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7339194 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7339195 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7339196 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7339197 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7339198 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7339199 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7339200 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7339201 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7339202 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7339203 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7339204 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7339205 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7339206 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7339207 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7339208 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7339209 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7339210 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7339211 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7339212 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7339213 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7339214 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7339215 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7339216 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7339217 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7339218 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7339219 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7339220 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7339221 right now more than ever we just cant afford insert here
7339222 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7339223 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7339224 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night

7339425 across the state and country credit unions generally considered the most conservative of lenders are seeing a rise in delinquent mortgages late credit card payments and late auto loan payments
7339426 marla shepard ceo of california coast credit union is also seeing fallout from overextended consumers
7339427 we also are seeing and im hearing this elsewhere too a significant increase in the number of bankruptcies whats a little concerning is some of these members filing for bankruptcy are not delinquent yet on their loans with california coast
7339428 were having a tough time identifying how bad its going to be shepard said
7339429 during the recent housing boom thousands of adjustable rate mortgages were issued without verifying the borrowers ability to repay them
7339430 to get home loans today consumers need to have skin in the game said ed smith jr chairman of government affairs and industry relations for the association of mortgage brokers
7339431 in the heyday we were giving 100 percent financing to people one day out of bankruptcy said smith
7339432 falling prices sent housing affordability soaring across california in the second quarter the california association of realtors reported last week
7339433 but this jump in affordability isnt translating into a sales boom because the credit crunch that erupted a year ago is still with us so while prices appear affordable they really are not
7339434 the lack of investor appetite for mortgage securities has forced the home loan originators to be a lot more conservative in their underwriting standards and thats led to the drying up of credit despite the fact that interest rates are still at very low levels said nima nattagh an analyst at lender processing services a provider of mortgage services
7339435 robert kleinhenz the associations deputy chief economist said affordability and housing prices have retreated to levels last seen in 2003 whats different sales
7339436 for all of 2003 there were 601 770 sales but in 2008 if the market matches the second quarter pace for the entire year there would be just 403 660 sales
7339437 getting their hands on a loan though the second quarter continued to be quite difficult he said of the situation facing creditworthy buyers
7339438 the associations index is based on first time buyers getting a home equal to 85percent of the median price in their area and assumes a 10 percent down payment
7339439 in los angeles county the entry level house cost 355 130 in the second quarter to buy it a family would need an annual income of 67 840 the monthly mortgage payment including taxes and insurance would be 2 260
7339440 a year earlier that house cost 504 080 the qualifying income level was 101 550 and the monthly payment was 3 380
7339441 the whole mess in the financial sector is in my view an unusual constraint kleinhenz said
7339442 ellie wooten the likable mayor of this likable central valley city is on her way to the office when her cellphone rings a constituent wants her mortgage payments reduced and is hoping that the mayor has some clout with her lender
7339443 although merced has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country this borrower isnt in such dire straits shes not even behind on her mortgage but her oldest daughter is turning 18 which means an end to 500 a month in child support she just wants a better deal
7339444 the mayor hangs up and shrugs its a surprise her daughter is turning 18
7339445 but hardly anyone in merced planned very far ahead not the city which enthusiastically approved the creation of dozens of new neighborhoods without pausing to wonder if it could absorb the growth
7339446 certainly not the developers they built 4 397 new homes in those neighborhoods some costing half a million dollars without asking who in a city of only 80 000 could afford to buy them all
7339447 and sadly not the local folk who moved up and took on more debt than they could afford they believed because who was telling them differently that the good times would be endless
7339448 owning a home is the american dream says jamie schrole a merced real estate agent
7339449 in the three years since housing peaked here the median sales price has fallen by 50 percent there are thousands of foreclosures on the market but almost no homeowner can afford to sell if you cannot go as low as the foreclosure price the cost of a comparable bank owned house real estate agents say you might as well not even bother listing your home
7339450 the boom here allowed some people to become rich overnight and gave many more the idea that they could do it too
7339451 its about the size of seven ping pong tables and all yours starting at 279 000 a san francisco design and development firm has begun marketing 98 tiny condominiums ranging from 250 to 350 square feet at the cubix yerba buena building in soma
7339452 architect george hauser is the first to say the studios are too small for many people families in particular he and local planning groups however believe the so called micro units represent one means of providing more first time home buying opportunities in a city where most prices outstrip most incomes
7339453 its not the last place a person might own but a great place to spend three to five years as a young single to build equity and move up

7339542 the month of ramadan in which was revealed the quran a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion between right and wrong so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadan he must fast that month and whoever is ill or on a journey the same number of days which one did not fast must be made up from other days allah intends for you ease and he does not want to make things difficult for you he wants that you must complete the same number of days and that you must magnify allah for having guided you so that you may be grateful to him
7339543 i dont want you to feel sorry for me or anything
7339544 therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship
7339545 do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is his good pleasing and perfect will
7339546 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
7339547 for by the grace given me i say to every one of you do not think of yourself more highly than you ought but rather think of yourself with sober judgment in accordance with the measure of faith god has given you
7339548 just as each of us has one body with many members and these members do not all have the same function so in christ we who are many form one body and each member belongs to all the others we have different gifts according to the grace given us if a mans gift is prophesying let him use it in proportion to his faith if it is serving let him serve if it is teaching let him teach if it is encouraging let him encourage if it is contributing to the needs of others let him give generously if it is leadership let him govern diligently if it is showing mercy let him do it cheerfully
7339549 faith is a living and unshakable confidence a belief in the grace of god so assured that a man would die a thousand deaths for its sake

7339605 we are the largest law enforcement union in the state and we do not solicit by phone

7339629 indian team was worried when jayawrdene and thushara were scoring runs
7339630 having a fifth bowler is a luxury we have to make do with four bowlers but we have bowlers like yuvraj raina and virat who can bowl we needed one extra batsman
7339631 earlier india had batsmen who could play till the end and i could go for big shots early i am however happy that i still have strike rate of 90 thougu i would have been happier to have a strike rate of over hundred
7339632 when you are scoring centuries you dont ask these questions every batsman has highs and lows the idea of playing sangakkara as opener is to have some senior batsman to get more balls to play
7339633 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london

7339653 boxing has a long way to go cricket is still the main sport in india it is a much much more glamorous game and has a much much wider audience in the country but maybe the time has come for other sports like shooting boxing and wrestling to be promoted on a larger scale we need big sponsors and big money for that i am sure the government will do the needful now

7339664 this provincial councils victory is the verdict given by the people by this election president has sought a mandate from the people for the 32 months administration of the upfa government and they have overwhelmingly endorsed it
7339665 our president has asked for their verdict and requested whether they approve the humanitarian war what he is doing in the north and how its works in liberating the people of the northern province and about the activities we are undertaking to develop the local economy giving priority to make the country self sufficient in food and to produce everything in sri lanka where we can produce also to develop the villages through the villages awakening program and also on our harden resolve of not to sell any of the governments assets to foreigners by privatization
7339666 so we are very thankful to the people who voted for us and also i take this opportunity to thank the election commissioner his staffs all the gas and the government officials who have worked tirelessly to have a free and fair election and also to those police and army who kept the peace during the two provincial council elections
7339667 also we thank specially the workers farmers and all other voters who approved this
7339668 this was the only way left for the people to express their appreciation and thanks to our great soldiers and the people have done that i hope all the ethnic groups in the country will jointly work together as sri lankans to bring peace and development to our motherland
7339669 we are doing our best to alleviate their sufferings and we are holding several discussions regarding these humanitarian issues with the un and un organizations including the unhcr and the world food organizations
7339670 we are at present taking this issue into serious consideration we are seriously discussing this with some un organizations and with the military to see whether it is possible to set up a safe corridor for our people trapped in the vanni to be safely moved out into the government areas
7339671 you must address this question to mr prabakaran and the ltte
7339672 no we have not discussed anything to that effect with anyone

7339710 gulp uh yes sir mr president er i mean mr senator
7339711 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7339712 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7339713 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7339714 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7339715 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7339716 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7339717 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7339718 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7339719 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7339720 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7339721 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7339722 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7339723 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7339724 og hvis i vil have varme p v relset bliver det kr 85 ekstra

7339728 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7339729 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7339730 that is either a high flying plane or a low satellite
7339731 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7339732 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7339733 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7339734 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7339735 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7339736 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7339737 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7339738 who are open to doing something on the production side
7339739 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7339740 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7339741 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7339742 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7339743 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7339744 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7339745 decid seguir por el camino de la responsabilidad en esos momentos porque pens que no conven a al club entrar en una espiral
7339746 no siento presi n a adida por afrontar el abierto de estados unidos como n mero uno del mundo la presi n es la misma cuando el objetivo que t tienes es ganar da lo mismo
7339747 es una gran satisfacci n despu s de tanto tiempo situado en el n mero dos pero no cambian mucho las cosas
7339748 durante estos cinco a os ten a la necesidad de ganar cada torneo y creo que esto har cambiar un poco nadal sentir ahora lo que yo he sentido durante mucho tiempo ser interesante ver c mo se desempe a en todas las superficies en las que est demostrando un gran nivel de juego rafa es ahora el favorito
7339749 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7339750 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7339751 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7339752 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7339753 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7339754 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7339755 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7339756 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7339757 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7339758 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7339759 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7339760 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7339761 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7339762 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7339763 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7339764 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7339765 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7339766 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7339767 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7339768 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7339769 me da la confianza ese extra que te falta como delantero para mostrarte en la cancha y espero seguir as en los pr ximos partidos

7339771 fue por respeto a todo lo que me dio pachuca me toc hacer el gol precisamente ante ellos as se dio y ahora hay que seguir adelante

7339778 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7339779 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7339780 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7339781 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7339782 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7339783 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7339784 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7339785 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7339786 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7339787 we have directed our militants to stop attacks against the government and security forces in bajaur from today
7339788 the jirga elders council insisted taliban should stop fighting in the interest of the people of bajaur
7339789 we are ready for talks with the government and the truce is an important development towards dialogue
7339790 we do not believe in their verbal commitments if they are sincere they should first surrender
7339791 five militants were killed in the mortar fire targeting suspected militant hideouts
7339792 we have directed our militants to stop attacks against the government and security forces in bajaur from today
7339793 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7339794 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7339795 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7339796 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7339797 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7339798 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7339799 a former call of duty producer type from activision talks about starting up an independent studio kind of trashes gears of war in an answer about games being art and explains how they got their first game deal
7339800 a tip from a source close to microsofts marketing department
7339801 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7339802 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7339803 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7339804 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7339805 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7339806 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7339807 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7339811 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7339812 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7339813 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7339814 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7339815 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7339816 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7339817 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7339818 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7339819 it is a total disgrace this proud night for britain has been sullied by this grotesque representation of london
7339820 clearly whoever was responsible must be found and fired immediately
7339821 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7339822 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7339823 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7339824 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7339825 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7339826 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7339827 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7339828 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7339829 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7339830 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7339831 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7339832 we also failed to include astrology alchemy and the concept of the moon being made of green cheese

7339882 were going to be going to the convention this week and if youre paying attention youll have a sense of who i am
7339883 my wife michelle speaks tomorrow night and youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care we had to figure out you know how to start a college fund for their kids um you know youll find out hes pretty much like us
7339884 when you dont know how many homes you have and you define being wealthy as having 5 million then what that tells me is that you just dont get whats going on with peoples everyday lives the folks who are making 20 000 a year or 40 000 a year or 60 000 a year that are trying to get their kid into college or trying to pay their healthcare premiums at the end of every month
7339885 thats who im fighting for thats what built america that middle class this election is about you
7339886 we had a great day yesterday when i had the honor of introducing my selection as running mate the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the u s joe biden

7339899 some italian athletes autonomously and without renouncing their commitment to sports made a symbolic gesture in favor of tibet and the dalai lama
7339900 in the field of great conquests for civil rights public opinion makes the difference and to move public opinion the gesture of an athlete is more important than the gesture
7339901 i cant say at all that we have confidence in israel
7339902 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7339903 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7339904 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7339905 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant

7339911 one graph that includes all types of relationships in one perfectly orchestrated universe is a geek blogger dream its not mass market
7339912 the amount of effort in building and maintaining it is hard it may be important to have different baseline rules for different brands and different networks
7339913 the simple misconception is that any communications infrastructure can be used for anything the question is what is the use case the interesting overlap is public profile presence in search engines and the potential business applications that can be built on the social graph
7339914 diversity is part of what makes the ecosystem good and interesting for consumers
7339915 we are going to probably going to provide some apps on facebook we have one my company is hiring but it has no traction
7339916 we will provide professional apps to the degree the audience wants them it depends on how much energy or investment they are worth
7339917 our interest is in making sure people can make themselves effective day by day and week by week
7339918 you cant just build random applications for it i would speculate from other parties not having done facebook apps yet it is less about fear and more about return on investment
7339919 if you can import relationships that matter and enables applications you can change peoples lives
7339920 rising above the noise is more difficult because it is so easy to write applications
7339921 what hasnt worked so far on facebook is business politics and money
7339922 what is still up in the air is the establishment of new use cases and major applications anything you try to charge for someone else will give away as way to acquire customers at least three people will try to copy whatever works
7339923 at obama events across the country what is noticeable is the diversity of the crowd and the unique level of energy from groups of people who may not have attended a political event for any other candidate in the past
7339924 this is 2007 not 2004 back in 2004 the strategy was get them to your web site that was the goal
7339925 these days the web is a much busier fragmented diverse world and while these social networking sites are still really in their infancy its hard to resist their value in reaching people
7339926 at its highest level google is a company that is dependent upon having a great web platform
7339927 in a lot of ways this is the greatest thing that couldve happened to us
7339928 weve already been very successful with that strategy on facebook but then spreading to every other social network out there without an open standard would be much more expensive harder to justify and harder to prioritize
7339929 were in a period of time when were realizing that social web stuff isnt just fun its really fundamental
7339930 what were seeing in walled gardens like facebook and myspace is an attempt to create a web operating system so theres been all this talk over the past six months about platforms by supporting these opensocial apis we can carve out real estate that can be populated with any sorts of applications
7339931 we would love myspace to be a part of it
7339932 orkut is the first customer of opensocial on the google side
7339933 we think there are opportunities to make gmail and igoogle more social as well
7339934 thats not part of the apis right now and google doesnt really have a social search engine in the same way that facebook has
7339935 all that information that theyre getting from those social networks they could use that for an upgraded model of adsense
7339936 they can also be very challenging youre trying to get a bunch of different firms with competing interests to try to go along coalitions of this sort can be problematic over time
7339937 opensocial doesnt change the fact that we truly have no interest in zombie biting and food fights on linkedin
7339938 in order to be in the linkedin directory we will have some set of standards
7339939 i cant say that there will be no risks here
7339940 i think were in an early phase of the social web and its an experimental phase so i think well be learning as we go
7339941 facebook and myspace are trying to build a proprietary web platform
7339942 those of us that believe in openness saw that as a threat to the open web
7339943 you look at something like pong now and it compares poorly with what we have today but at the time it was like a nuclear bomb in the gaming industry
7339944 right now you look at the applications on facebook and there just isnt that much thats really sophisticated theres years of development before we see something like quake in social networks but thats where this is going
7339945 the killer app for opensocial will be somebody making a really good spreadsheet component
7339946 theres no way a company wants to host an application like that on facebook especially in the world of regulatory laws hipaa and sarbanes oxley it would just be asinine
7339947 what youll see in the end is great third party developers making even more business apps for us very soon
7339948 this continues a trend of using consumer technologies to make business technologies better
7339949 from my point of view opensocial is really about the widget economy weve seen in a short amount of time build up around social networking
7339950 opensocial is energizing that economy now as developers work can be translated to different contexts and platforms
7339951 previous efforts like openid were pretty complicated for something to be useful from the users perspective it has to be simple and easy
7339952 weve had quite a strong weekend ive had a traumatised weekend ive had a problem health wise
7339953 but we got some good points this weekend and so it was solid for us
7339954 i got a reasonably decent start but i just had to try and hold my spot but after that i was able to relax and try and attack and keep up with massa
7339955 i thought we would keep a certain gap and maintain it but he just stretched it
7339956 weve come here to a new track and did a fantastic job preparing the car in the sessions and choosing the right tyres which was pretty difficult
7339957 then making the pole and winning the race and making the fastest lap there is nothing more we can ask for
7339958 logiciel songbird veut se faire une place entre itunes et windows media player
7339959 all massages are performed by a certified massage therapist licensed through the state of georgia
7339960 everybody knows about the regular job boards but there is a whole market of hidden unadvertised jobs and we think that posting these resignations is complementary to official job boards and classifieds
7339961 people post their job up because they know that they are probably going to help someone else to find a job
7339962 it all sounds very altruistic but i think thats the way it works we dont entirely understand it because we dont incentivise or pay anybody to post their job up but we get some 6 000 people a month telling us that they are leaving their jobs
7339963 its quite good to have a big say in who you might be working with
7339964 you can get a good idea of what someone is like by e mail
7339965 employers can reduce recruitment costs and improve employee retention by getting referrals from people they trust the best possible filter employees or moles will be rewarded for referring quality candidates as well as gaining kudos from the boss for engaging in recruitment

7339967 what im looking to do is drive people to my web site www after5detroit com it is as easy as a click of a button when people meet me through internet networks
7339968 everything i do involves ways to invite friends link friends encourage people to participate in after5s events
7339969 in my experience the online business networks are one dimensional anyone can present anything they want and theres no way to validate or invalidate if true
7339970 you expose yourself to billions of members a glorified yellow pages you have no ties to these circles
7339971 at least half of my business comes from online out of the box networking but it is important to have live events as well
7339972 most other networking groups ask you to make a one minute speech about yourself we ask people to take ties off have a martini and relax while sharing business cards
7339973 if you show people a benefit remind them of options people will click with you right away you are in the same virtual medium
7339974 the first thing i do when i wake up and last thing i do at night is check my business networks
7339975 i can use the search tools to send invitations to just gay men
7339976 we hook the twentysomethings who are addicted to myspace they wouldnt know of us otherwise
7339977 networking is all about building trusted relationships virtual networking helps leverage and extend your reach while physical meetings offer genuine communication
7339978 i log onto the network forums to get help with human resource issues
7339979 the key design is to match up people looking for the same thing through a social business network
7339980 you can operate from your house and be a global company
7339981 at this point if you come in and upload your address book and connect with people that are here it doesnt take much experimenting
7339982 you can be off to the races immediately and thats one of the benefits of being at a scale of 12 million people
7339983 for many people these sites will mirror the way we behave off line
