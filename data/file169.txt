1690012 i do wonder if the people who are doing the tests are too strict they might be too severe and they could be expecting too much of course we have to be careful but with a 39 pass rate you have to question if they are overdoing the rules a bit
1690013 its terrible what the residents have to put up with

1690022 today my colleague the minister for arts sports and tourism martin cullen has announced that nine carlow clubs and 17 kilkenny clubs are to benefit from the government sports grants scheme its excellent news for carlow and kilkenny
1690023 i want to say well done to all the clubs involved in the sports capital programme its great to see the money being invested in sport times have become slower nowadays with the downturn in the economy so its good to see that children are still being looked after by the government through the arena of sport
1690024 well we had applied for more but then there were cutbacks
1690025 but its 65 000 more than we had at the start of the week the floodlighting will cost about 130 000 so well have to do a bit of extra fundraising but we are very grateful for the grant
1690026 we have 150 to 200 members and the club is the backbone of the community the people in the community are very good to us with regard to functions and the likes and then we put a lot back into the community but i have to say that there was a time when we were a lot stronger we set up a sub committee to take care of the application so its a credit to them and the club its good to see the money coming into the other clubs as well because they are all great for their communities

1690033 i am not that stupid that i would put myself in that position of being her manager with my role in the media it would be a conflict of interest

1690035 i say to him its just a race people will just go back to watching neighbours when its over it seems like a big deal but at the end of the day its a running race just look at it as a running race

1690046 i didnt run the relay because i couldnt run the relay i know it was stated that i chose not to run the relay for my own reasons but that was bullshit

1690054 there are 3000 parking spaces infrastructure utilities and more at nautica
1690055 it seemed like a more perfect fit as a venue minimizing costs of all the things that go into producing the festival

1690170 rooneys illness will call into question uniteds decision to fly to nigeria for a money spinning exhibition game against portsmouth at the end of their ten day tour to south africa although of more pressing concern to sir alex ferguson will be the forwards wellbeing and the fact that the manager is likely to start the season without at least seven senior first team players in addition to rooney united will be missing louis saha park ji sung and owen hargreaves all of whom have knee problems and cristiano ronaldo who has been ruled out until october with an ankle injury nani is suspended for the first two matches of the campaign after his red card against west ham united last season while anderson is away with brazil at the olympic games in beijing

1690176 possibly because as recession bites soccer english soccer specifically wallows in a global television rights deal that guarantees each of the 20 premier league clubs 50 million a season from now until 2010 this represents a 60 percent increase in television income at a time when even the banks are not safe and it is the beginning not the end of what the clubs can reap through ticket sales merchandising sponsorship and the holy grail of champions league income currently dominated by english teams so for every denial that newcastles board might make about newspaper speculation and even the denials coming thick and fast from supposed potential purchasers the prospect of another english club going to foreign markets makes sense

1690204 if as the appellant argues the facts giving rise to a conviction can on their own be used to reject a candidate for not being of good moral character this would mean that the provisions concerning a criminal record are redundant
1690205 consider the facts that resulted in a finding of guilt in assessing whether a candidate has the qualifications required for a job they must also consider the fact that the person has been pardoned

1690209 because my parents could see that acting was a real career although i had to wonder how lucky one girl could be because i was being paid to dance all day which was my other passion
1690210 they just dont call you back so you kind of figure it out real women have curves was a breakthrough for me because it was tailored for who i was at a specific period in time it said that there are different body types that are beautiful i think that opened so many doors for me and gave all women a boost of confidence

1690219 its just about feeling good in my own skin and feeling great about who i am as a person i want to embrace health thats why i dont overeat its just about feeling good
1690220 that has never been the case i dont assume it will ever be the case in my career im sure that for the rest of my life i will have to fight for the roles that i want
1690221 but i also know that the only roles worth doing are the ones worth fighting for

1690432 and it will be finished by 21 dec 2007 i hope everything is fine in this session and unn will accept my work finally
1690433 by zoe rice yesterday after work and its a smart and delightful read its also funny and a fast paced whats so cute and unique is that each chapter starts with a pick up line chapter 2 is it hot in here or is it just you this is a great summer read
1690434 ein bisschen wie ein formel 1 bolide aber ohne elektronik schnickschnack
1690435 ber 400 m lagen m chte ich meine bestzeit schwimmen dann ber 200 m delfin ins semifinale kommen
1690436 dinko muss aufpassen nicht zu schnell anzufangen sonst ist er nach 200 m vor phelps
1690437 ber 400 m lagen hat er gute chancen da kann er einen guten platz machen
1690438 das ist vier mal so schwierig wie 400 m kraul weil man zwischen vier lagen wechseln muss
1690439 da l sst man oft ein bisschen nach um im finish noch reserven zu haben
1690440 aber auch l nge drei muss unter 30 sekunden gehen
1690441 mir geht es gut ich f hle mich gut und bin schnell
1690442 das hauptbecken gef llt mir sehr gut es ist toll
1690443 im water cube ist doch so ein kuddelmuddel so viele fotografen da habe ich es im dorf entspannter
1690444 zu europa bekennen zu einer sinnvollen integration von ausl ndern und zu einer menschenw rdigen politik bereit sein und keine ihrer extremen forderungen vertreten
1690445 die anlage ist an sich weltklasse sie war aber so schlecht gewartet dass die h lfte der st nde defekt war und die andere h lfte lange zeit die sch sse nicht richtig angezeigt hat
1690446 die leute sind hier sehr bem ht und das olympische dorf ist einsame klasse
1690447 aufgrund dieser unterlagen werden wir uns dann f r eine variante entscheiden
1690448 konzerte und andere veranstaltungen werden die ausnahme bleiben wir haben aufgrund der bundesliga termine nur ein zeitfenster von maximal sechs wochen
1690449 es ist nicht normal dass man vor den olympischen spielen sechs stunden trainiert aber es war halt einfach notwendig weil wir einfach ein ergebnis haben wollten
1690450 wir hatten gl ck dass wir den erhofften trapezwind oder doppel trapezwind gehabt haben zwischen 10 und 12 knoten deshalb waren wir so extrem lange auf dem wasser und jetzt ist eigentlich das herausgekommen was wir uns gedacht haben und wie es ausschaut werden wir mit einem leicht abge nderten segel fahren das wir voriges jahr auch hier verwendet haben nicht das gleiche aber es kommt aus der serie raus
1690451 du segelst und segelst wochenlang und immer im hnlichen windbereich mit sehr wenig wind es braucht nur ein taifunausl ufer kommen dann haben wir zwei tage gescheiten wind und dann musst du auch wissen ob das segel funktioniert
1690452 wir haben bei dem segel angst gehabt dass es bei trapezwind nicht so gut funktioniert aber es war dem segel das wir bevorzugt h tten f r trapezwind sogar leicht berlegen deswegen k nnen wir jetzt beruhigt das wirkliche leichtwindsegel nehmen
1690453 wir besch ftigen uns noch immer mit sachen mit denen wir uns nicht besch ftigen wollen wir wollen regattatraining machen damit uns kein fehler beim start passiert aber segeln ist eine technische sportart und wenn du mit deinem untersatz auf dem du f hrst noch nicht ganz zufrieden bist brauchst du mit dem anderen nicht anfangen
1690454 ich habe siebeneinhalb jahre chinesische spitzenpolitiker getroffen und meine botschaft war immer die gleiche sie sollten religi se menschen in ihrer gesellschaft nicht f rchten

1690457 i must be given the reports of my dope test which says i flunked the test you declared me positive and you must prove it now
1690458 i cannot give it to any player i can give it to the federation and then they decide how and when to convey it to the player
1690459 you dont want to make india proud you want to bring it down
1690460 i had simply said that you cannot leave on august 6 you have to wait for one more day because there were procedures to be followed i was also giving you a hotel room
1690461 i want to make it clear that against the general perception i am not from andhra pradesh and i have no reason to promote shailaja i am just doing my job
1690462 we sai only said that monika has won two medals in olympic qualifying asian championship so she should go to beijing it is on record and you can check it

1690465 once poland has signed an agreement with the american side on deployment of elements of the missile defense there we will be able to discuss some additional aspects of our military and technical cooperation with belarus
1690466 the russian military are talking of strategic bombers and iskander systems
1690467 probably some actions will be taken albeit without belarus regaining its nuclear status

1690469 i praise that judge for stopping the federal government from going ahead to hand over bakassi to cameroun he is a brave and considerate judge who must have considered the feeling of many nigerians on this bakassi issue its clear that he is aware that most nigerians are not happy that the federal government was planning to hand over bakassi to cameroun that is why he said no way to any hand over and if president yaradua knows what hes doing he should obey that ruling of the federal high court
1690470 of course the judge knew what he was doing the fact is that the decision to hand bakassi over to cameroun was taken by obasanjo while he was still the president it was obasanjo that signed the agreement with cameroun and the united nations without even bothering to consult the national assembly its this lack of consultation with the national assembly that made the agreement illegal so the judge based his ruling on this as theres no way that the federal government can hand over any part of the country without the approval of the national assembly
1690471 the matter of whether nigeria should hand over bakassi or not goes beyond the judgement of a federal high court the issue is that as were talking here now bakassi is effectively a camerounian territory courtesy of the judgement of the world court it was both nigeria and cameroun that went to the world court to settle their quarrel over who owns the bakassi territory and they also agreed to abide by the judgement of the world court so how come its now that the whole world is waiting for us to implement that judgement that were trying to say no are we now saying that a world court judgement which we have earlier accepted is no longer binding on us because a federal high court is not happy that obasanjo did not consult the national assembly before signing the implementation agreement look that will rubbish our credibility before the international community although im not a lawyer but i feel that the federal high court ruling is based on sentiment because many people are angry with obasanjo over many of the things he did while in office because obasanjo is no longer popular some people now see the agreement he signed on bakassi as something to use against him by encouraging the people of bakassi to rebel against the world court judgement and the implementation of the judgement its wrong because failure to obey the world court judgement and honour the implementation agreement we signed will ridicule us in the eyes of the world
1690472 theres no way the international community will expect us to accept anything that is against our interest if our former president signs an agreement that is against our interest do they expect us to honour it just like that
1690473 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1690474 france assumes full responsibility for its actions in rwanda in 1994 especially those of its armed forces

1690479 this incident is the latest in a series of recent attempts by the government of gabon to restrict the work of transparency activists
1690480 he fall must resign and explain the movements of money through his account
1690481 we are very worried about the safety and well being of marc ona and his colleagues in gabon
1690482 the international community must send a strong message to the government of gabon that this campaign of intimidation and harassment against civil society activists is simply unacceptable
1690483 lets make these elections as an example for africa and the world

1690485 i believe it is important for political parties to try to maintain the highest political standards so voters can have faith in the integrity of our system
1690486 so if chairman rivera believes jack davis broke the law i applaud him for coming forward but if he really believes in honesty and integrity he will return the tens of thousands of dollars he has taken from the man he now describes as a lawbreaker
1690487 is what wojtaszek saying is that hed keep his mouth shut if someone paid him enough money even if he knew they did something illegal
1690488 truth is difficult to come by and a lot of us dont hear it enough were probably not brave like him solzhenitsyn
1690489 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks
1690490 then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
1690491 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by abc news to link the anthrax attacks to iraq and saddam hussein

1690499 la communaut internationale commet une terrible erreur en faisant pression sur nous affirmant que tous les inculp s sont en serbie
1690500 je ne peux accepter ce raisonnement selon lequel il est logique que mladic se trouve en serbie dans la mesure o karadzic sy trouvait
1690501 nous naffirmons pas quil ne sy trouve pas mais pour avancer une telle affirmation vous vous devez de disposer de certains l ments conduisant sa cache le reste est sp culation

1690504 allah telah berfirman dalam sebuah hadis qudsi aku bagi surah al fatihah antara aku dan hamba ku setengahnya untuk ku dan sebahagian yang lain utunk hamba ku dan akan kukabulkan apa apa yang dimohon oleh hamba ku
1690505 hamba ku telah memulai dengan menyebut nama ku dan kerananya aku berhak untuk menyempurnakan segala perkaranya serta memberkati seluruh keadaannya
1690506 hamba ku telah memuja ku dia tahu bahawa nikmat yang ada di sisinya adalah dari ku dan bencana yang dijauhkan darinya adalah lantaran kasih sayang ku kupersilakan kepada kalian bahawa kini aku tambahkan nikmat nikmat akhirat di samping nikmat nikmat dunia dan akan ku jauhkan darinya bencana bencana akhirat sebagaimana kujauhkan darinya bencana bencana dunia
1690507 hamba ku telah menyaksikan ku bahawa akulah yang maha pengasih dan maha penyayang kini kupersaksikan kepada kalian bahawa aku akan penuhi nasib hidupnya dengan rahmat ku dan akan kukurniai hayatnya dengan pemberian pemberian ku
1690508 kupersaksikan kepada kalian sebagaimana yang diakuinya bahawa akulah yang berkuasa pada hari pembalasan itu dan akan kupermudahkan hisabnya pada hari hisah kelak serta akan kumaafkan segala kesalahannya
1690509 hamba ku benar ketiak dia menyembah ku kini kupersaksikan kepada kalian bahwa aku akan berikan kepadanya ganjaran kerana ibadahnya sehingga orang orang tidak sama sepertinya akan merasa iri kepadanya
1690510 hamba ku telah minta pertolongan dari ku dan kembali kepada ku kini kupersaksikan kepada kalian bahawa aku akan menolongnya dalam setiap urusannya aku akan membatunya dalam kesulitan kesulitannya dan akan kuhulurkan tangan ku kepadanya pada saat dukanya
1690511 tunjukilah kami jalan yang lurus iaitu jalan orang orang yang telah engkau anugerahi nikmat bukan jalan mereka yang dimurkai dan bukan pula jalan mereka yang sesat
1690512 bahagian ini untuk hamba ku mereka berhak mendapatkan apa yang mereka mohonkan aku telah kabulkan permohonan hamba ku aku telah berikan kepadanya apa yang diharapkannya aku telah menyelamatkannya dari apa yang dia mohonkan dengan perlindugan ku

1690514 were managing the firm to not have to access the government support
1690515 these have been reviewed over time and were approved last year in kampala uganda
1690516 a delegation from the secretariat has recently visited rwanda to assess the countrys readiness to join the organisation we appreciate these developments since our application to join the community of nations but as much as we hope to gain from the commonwealth we also have something to contribute
1690517 the country has traveled a challenging journey over 14 years and scored many achievements causing deep admiration thereby expressing solidarity with those who have brought durable peace and stability in rwanda
1690518 while we are very proud of these results we are aware that this has been possible by the support we have got from our government our mother ministry minicom the travel agents hotels and the office of immigration bnr and recreational facilities
1690519 we must celebrate but remain cognizant of the challenge and need to continuously improve the experience of visiting and being in rwanda
1690520 the state council headed by gen mohamed ould abdelaziz declares that the decree by which the former president had dismissed the chief of staff of the national army the chief of the special presidential staff the chief of the national gendarmes and the chief of the national guards is annulled legally and practically
1690521 the president has just been arrested five minutes ago by members of the presidential security battalion on the orders of gen abdelaziz
1690522 they came here to find him they arrested him here and took him to the battalion base its a textbook coup detat

1690535 made the key decisions that will enable us to run aols access and audience businesses separately beginning in 2009
1690536 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1690537 marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1690538 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1690539 xstratas offer reflects the operational weakness that lonmin has seen which has made lonmin vulnerable
1690540 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly
1690541 xstrata is easily big enough they can afford to buy lonmin certainly
1690542 we are dramatically ahead of the aggressive plans weve established
1690543 we stand by what we said in that we have to deliver the benefit to our shareholders and to our customers
1690544 on the listing side it has not been a good year for ipos
1690545 what we know is what weve seen in the first half of the year and weve seen record volume and volatility we remain optimistic that transaction volume will be quite high through the end of year
1690546 in good times and bad times transaction volumes tend to increase
1690547 we are seeing signs of progress from our efforts to improve the customer experience rebuild the sprint brand and increase our profitability
1690548 the 790gx is being positioned right below amds top of the line 790fx with a typical motherboard built around the technology costing around 355

1690556 the most noticeable thing about the shop is the lighting
1690557 this consists of sharp black silhouettes that turn out to be lamps made of waste materials from the fietsfabriek old bicycle tyre inner tubes leds allow the colours to change gradually this gives the shop a surprising and unique image on the street especially at night
1690558 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1690559 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1690560 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1690561 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand
1690562 norways talented forwards solveig gulbrandsen wiik and larsen kaurin proved a handful for the americans the trio looked dangerous as they sought to capitalize on the counter as the u s pushed forward in the second half

1690572 for sure he will be on the start list for tomorrow from the beginning and i am sure he can be here with us for the rest of the competition
1690573 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1690574 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games
1690575 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are a unique opportunity for a player as they are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1690576 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1690577 speaking through an interpreter batista said that despite the cas decision in beijing messi wanted to stay and play at the olympics
1690578 the player will be here and will remain with the team
1690579 we have the hope that he will remain with the team for the entire tournament
1690580 he messi told us he wants to stay hes relaxed and asks the people at barcelona to understand his situation the club is relaxed and i was figuring to put messi in the starting 11
1690581 with their prestige they should disassociate themselves to tobacco products which have no value or use they should heed the law and bring the youth to other productive activities tobacco products should not be promoted

1690585 management asked me who went to the new times and i refused to tell them anything and two days later the director sacked me
1690586 we are all in real danger of losing our jobs this is his method of work whoever complains is sacked and that is how he has operated since we started working for him
1690587 why dont you leave rwacom alone my workers said that they have never spoken to you you wrote a story about rwacom and if you do it again i will have a case against you
1690588 an assessment of the construct validity of environmental strategy measures
1690589 a companys unique historical conditions of its establishment dictate how it acquires and exploits resources and therefore how well it performs
1690590 the stakeholder network influences environmental strategy through social pressure and can determine the type of environmental strategy a company pursues
1690591 i am not a racist and i believe in multi cultural societies going back to my country holland
1690592 i am here for football i want only the best for africa rwanda inclusive in any case if i was a racist i wouldnt come to work in africa
1690593 abbas in a bid to prove himself to the coaches he did too much and ended up failing completely
1690594 in football you dont play like in a chicken farm where you can afford to play anyhow thats what abbas was doing during the few days we had him with us
1690595 one of the pillars of football is to enjoy yourself while playing thats what i want my players to do
1690596 in football there is a difference between playing to win and playing not to lose i personally prefer the former
1690597 im happy with my bosses but only when they let me do my work the way i feel is the best for the boys players the team and the fans
1690598 wouldnt you rather fight them overseas than in salt lake city
1690599 god is just testing our faith but in the end it will all work out right eously

1690602 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1690603 and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1690604 im paris hilton and i approve this message because i think its totally hot
1690605 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccain s all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama
1690606 it was a great experience before competing for the soviet union and twice for georgia but this is special because the u s olympic committee cares so much for us
1690607 im hoping i can do something special and get a medal and make the united states very proud because i am very very proud to be part of the u s team
1690608 the five person u s archery team is a diverse group it includes 52 year old butch johnson and 19 year old brady ellison
1690609 thats what i really respect the law is the same for everybody rich or poor
1690610 my mom and dad are happily married theyre still married theyre still happy theyre happy because im happy
1690611 she always wanted to live here and be part of this team
1690612 i think sometimes she appreciates her american citizenship more than some of us that were born here
1690613 thats understandable considering lorig waited about eight years for citizenship she said shes not sure why the process took so long
1690614 you can ask immigration i would like to know that too
1690615 i guess a lot of people want to move into the united states and immigration is very busy
1690616 i love my previous country because thats where i was born and raised
1690617 lorigs new team has been struggling lately too in archery at least the americans didnt win a medal in the sport in 2004 and the u s women are without an individual medal since 1976
1690618 being newer to the country she appreciates many of the freedoms that we have even more
1690619 the tournament just started and this was a good result
1690620 now we need to have a good preparation to play against brazil and germany
1690621 our game plan was to match them speed for speed and skill for skill
1690622 but unfortunately that didnt happen our game plan didnt work today

1690627 it is odd really but when you think about it almost all of the communication tools that are available to us today largely focus on communicating with or through written or spoken word yet there we are in a world that is becoming more and more visually aware and there is no recognized visual language of communication this is what imagini is all about working with millions of people to create a new language of communication
1690628 heard an interesting rumor today from an academic who heard through the phd grapevine google is working on turning google earth into a virtual world a la second life that would be an interesting development both for google

1690634 deleuze 1990 spinoza died in february 1677 of a lung illness perhaps tuberculosis or silicosis caused by fine glass dust inhaled while tending to his trade
1690635 these are the fundamental concepts with which spinoza sets forth a vision of being illuminated by his awareness of god

1690838 our on site stay ducation programs are yet another demonstration of verizon wireless commitment to our talented goal oriented performance driven employees
1690839 were a great place to work for a lot of reasons and our growing on site campus program coupled with our generous tuition assistance is one of them
1690840 these programs are not only good for employees they are also good for the business
1690841 our long term relationship with at amp t has played a large role in our companys growth and success
1690842 at amp ts supplier diversity programs have empowered us to be a role model to other diversity owned businesses and have given us the knowledge and skills to remain competitive as the telecommunications industry evolves
1690843 there are mutual benefits for at amp t and the diversity owned companies that we do business with
1690844 these suppliers help us customize our global network to deliver a seamless world of communications for the needs of our diverse customer base we help them grow their capabilities and businesses through the offerings of our supplier diversity programs providing opportunities for minority women and disabled veteran owned businesses just makes good business sense
1690845 i heard very positive remarks about the mde program before attending
1690846 the program was even better than i had hoped we were able to apply lessons learned on our first day back in the office
1690847 by making a commitment to diversity owned businesses we have brought a vast array of skills and knowledge into the at amp t family
1690848 together we form a stronger supply chain community capable of facing new challenges and shaping the future of communications
1690849 oscar rodriguez and jesus diaz have built a strong team and formidable e commerce website for diamonds and jewelry that competes with such companies as blue nile with our recent purchase of our studio we have the ability to give access to the abazias team to film diamonds jewelry segments and instructional videos for their website and even to launch their own jewelry tv channel abazias management can also leverage off of omnireliants option to license jewelry using the kathy hilton brand omnireliant with abazias has secured the domain name hiltondiamonds com with the anticipation of the option of rolling that platform out at a later time we believe with our current synergies we can continue to grow both companies prospects in the direct response industry and ecommerce

1690868 waar ben ik aan begonnen en wat is dit voor een zootje
1690869 we continue to deliver iphones to direct fulfillment customers every day
1690870 god is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him
1690871 we were meant to live for so much more have we lost ourselves somewhere deep inside
1690872 to you o lord i lift up my soul o my god in you i trust do not let me be ashamed do not let my enemies exult over me indeed none of those who wait for you will be ashamed those who deal treacherously without cause will be ashamed make me know your ways o lord teach me your paths lead me in your truth and teach me for you are the god of my salvation for you i wait all the day remember o lord your compassion and your lovingkindness for they have been from old do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions according to your lovingkindness remember me for your goodness sake o lord good and upright is the lord therefore he instructs sinners in the way he leads the humble in justice and he teaches the humble his way all paths of the lord are lovingkindness and truth to those who keep his covenant and his testimonies for your names sake o lord pardon my iniquity for it is great who is the man who fears the lord he will instruct him in the way he should choose his soul will abide in prosperity and his descendants will inherit the land
1690873 for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord gives grace and glory no good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly
1690874 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
1690875 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
1690876 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
1690877 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
1690878 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
1690879 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
1690880 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
1690881 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
1690882 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
1690883 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
1690884 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
1690885 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
1690886 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
1690887 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
1690888 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
1690889 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
1690890 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
1690891 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1690892 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
1690893 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
1690894 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
1690895 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
1690896 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
1690897 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
1690898 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
1690899 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
1690900 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
1690901 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
1690902 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
1690903 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
1690904 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
1690905 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
1690906 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
1690907 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
1690908 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
1690909 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
1690910 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
1690911 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
1690912 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
1690913 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
1690914 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
1690915 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
1690916 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
1690917 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
1690918 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
1690919 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
1690920 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
1690921 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine

1690926 we couldnt be more excited about our artist lineup and what theyre doing to help support team usa and these athletes

1690937 niea under 7 at a local gamestop and suncoast video and i admit that the quirky cover with some girl with elf like ears with toe puppets on her toes made me take a second look and consider it for purchase

1690953 and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell hades followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth
1690954 acts 20 24 which is being preached now will cease and the preaching of the
1690955 repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
1690956 and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was an earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bond man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand

1690985 how much did you change your philosophy from one year to the next
1690986 one of the key statements that i make to the team is that were going to do things better than its ever been done before
1690987 that mentality has to be throughout it has to be woven through the fabric that we will not rest that we will not settle that we will be relentless in pursuit of a competitive edge
1690988 they probably have a 1 500 to 1 600 yard rusher in there and theyre never going to find out

1690993 to me doing these auctions is better than going to the racetrack you have about the same chance of hitting it big
1690994 you never know what youre going to get or how much itll go for
1690995 i found a 50 bill in one box last week and ive found diamond rings and jewelry stuffed in boxes of clothes too so it always pays to look
1690996 last week i got a unit full of toys brand new stuff still in the plastic wrappers
1690997 it was somebodys christmas and they locked everything up and then couldnt pay the bill
1690998 virtually every self storage facility has had to have an auction at one time or another what we find when we open up many of these units the contents really dont have much value for the people in the outside world
1690999 its mostly things that have a personal emotional value to the person thats storing them
1691000 i opened the box up and it was one of those velvet covered things that you think that a ring or somethings in
1691001 it was real heavy and im thinking wow i hit the mother lode

1691042 wow that sounds great id really love to witness that
1691043 our normal habit our normal routine is we go to the beach on sunday we come home and then we swim in the pool for a little while and then i put the kids in the bath and they play and theyre still in their swimsuits and they just squirt toys at each other and willie puts bubble beards and bubble mohawks on her
1691044 oh which one do you think that is is that red

1691056 treading the footsteps of the vicious communal elements in jammu the reported enforcement of the anti kashmir economic blockade by bjp functionaries now even in some parts of punjab has started pushing kashmir towards absolute physical and economic isolation perhaps for the first time since independence
1691057 the fast worsening economic scenario in the areas facing the arbitrary blockade has assumed dangerous dimensions and such an intolerable situation cant be allowed to dither further
1691058 it is perhaps for the first time that a planned economic blockade was being enforced and facilitated against the kashmiris in such an organized manner
1691059 by throwing its lot with india jammu amp kashmir had sacrificed all its traditional routes and srinagar jammu highway remained its only land link with rest of the world

1691063 we have sent an e mail to the purdue university cyber forensic laboratory seeking their opinion on wireless routers but without specifying any other details of the present case under investigation
1691064 we have decided not to buy any product from traders in jammu and instead buy products directly from other markets like delhi and amritsar
1691065 we will not cooperate with the traders of jammu anymore we are not going to buy any goods from them we have decided to boycott jammu traders
1691066 the situation in the aftermath of economic blockade of the valley and attacks on minority community in jammu has made it clear that it is part of a well thought out conspiracy and the centre is involved in it
1691067 the amarnath yatra is being conducted smoothly as has been over the years

1691085 overly restrictive policies and controls can substantially inhibit community growth and can lead to the failure of the social application initiative
1691086 managing an appropriate balance between freedom and control is crucial to community growth and maintenance and must be tuned continuously

1691129 guys are going to struggle that is part of the game thats not the issue there is a way to act and carry yourself the way he left was unacceptable and disrespectful hes somebody we need and somebody we have to get right the physical issue becomes the no 1 priority for right now but that doesnt excuse what happened on the mound

1691140 were here to win but im not going to promise a medal or guarantee anything
1691141 we just got in from training in singapore and everythings great
1691142 our event starts saturday at 10 so i have to get some rest
1691143 obviously we didnt play as well as we would have liked to but its the first game of the olympics we were a little nervous a little anxious but we always say the first game in a tournament is the hardest to get a result in
1691144 i think it was a factor just in the sense that youll start to feel a bit more tired earlier on in the game than you would in another environment
1691145 but like ive said so many times before its something that both teams have to deal with so i dont think its necessarily going to change the game too much or the outcome of the game
1691146 after the ball went in the net i turned around and it just hit me that this is the first goal weve ever had in the olympics it was a special moment for me and my teammates
1691147 i think we slowly wore them down they started to get really tired at the end of the second half and thats when that type of thing comes into play
1691148 we didnt lose too many punts in the air that type of thing
1691149 we could probably have put away a few more goals on corners and free kicks but we got one off of it
1691150 it is my opinion that brandon oneill will be on the team theres no question about it
1691151 his leg is not so good now but improving very very fast compared to yesterday his legs much better he started to do some skills today on floor and vault i think everythings going very very well i hope 99 per cent that brandon will be ready he is very strong a tough boy he can do everything im sure
1691152 i dont think the ankles going to be 100 per cent
1691153 thats probably pretty obvious a lots going to come into just how big a heart brandon has and how much pain he can handle with the assistance of the medical team
1691154 for what he did today it wasnt that bad he spend the last two days lying in a bed with his leg up
1691155 it was a pretty big improvement from what we were doing
1691156 just before midnight during a supervised visit the father returned from the rear of the house to the front of the house and found that his estranged wife six kids and van were all missing
1691157 we are very concerned because the 3 year old needs an insulin shot three times a day and we do not believe the mother has any insulin
1691158 now she has a car we dont have any idea where she might be
1691159 i think the thing that maori are really starting to tweak to is that if you dont move and you stay in grievance mode everyone else takes off so i think its a wonderful day for these three its taken some intense negotiation
1691160 weve got a hive of interest and a hive of support for the process weve gone through its a long time happening bt its happened and i think thats the best outcome we could expect and wish for
1691161 mental health promotion is about including local councils its about educating people its about making sure weve got adequate funding its about making sure the environments well looked after and nurtured for us as maori thats key its also about making sure we have for maori those linkages back home
1691162 maori on the streets support each other hugely not just maori for that matter but that notion of whanau street whanau is a fairly strong one and at times i think we have to be careful its not exerting that pull factor that keeps people on the streets sometimes its an indictment to all society where people will feel greater support amongst their peers on the street as opposed to with to their own family or whanau of origins
1691163 theres absolutely no reason why we shouldnt get to 8 percent i listened to winston talking on maori television and he was saying that they polled at 1 percent one year and then ended up with 13 mps
1691164 we have a target of somewhere between 93 5 percent and 95 5 percent enrolled and were hoping that our new initiative using the bebo community to spread our message particularly to the young will help get us there
1691165 it can wear on you this little skid weve got going
1691166 the effort is there the work ethic is there i dont think anything is affecting us in those areas its just a tough skid
1691167 we had lost seven in a row and we had three outs to go to get the win our bullpen had pitched great to that point im frustrated with myself more than anything
1691168 huston is out there doing the best he can everybody goes through tough times
1691169 its a lot to ask of a guy to go three
1691170 if i had brought in ziegler in the eighth id have let him go the ninth
1691171 he did a lot of that work helping communities that were struggling in the community here in glen innes and eastern suburbs and also a lot of that kind of work around the marae and the people around the marae he had a lot of goodwill about him and the size of his funeral told you about the caliber of people that he had dealt with
1691172 if youre in a situation where you simply dont have enough food or money for food you can apply for a grant and if youve already used up your grant for the year you can go in sooner to get some so i think it will be helpful of course it doesnt address the big issue around benefit simply not being enough for people to live on
1691173 ive never been in swirling floodwaters before but whats scary is its the trees the foliage you cant see because you cant see tree branches little logs and things we were too scared to go through the water so we had to stop at an aunties house and we hitched a ride home on a four wheel drive but even those drivers were very cautious about floodwaters
1691174 any attempt to put more benefit is good but ultimately people want to stand on their won two feet and perhaps at the same time looking at an establishment grant a setting up grant of some kind may in fact be more effective in the long run
1691175 maoridoms doing everything it can when the electoral option comes up to enroll people inform them and all that sort of thing its really the electoral commission that has to go out there and keep those people on the roll thats their responsibility just running a red line through the names thats too easy in a country that prides itself on being a modern democracy its an appalling indictment
1691176 i find it disturbing that he does take a strongly racist stance because much of the stuff he criticises is maori and i just wonder what it does for him personally that he is so inclined
1691177 weve got so many in new zealand from earthquakes storms to tsunami and to encourage kids to learn about it and also to go home and talk about it to encourage their parents to take the simple steps to be better prepared
1691178 as a result of what were doing and what dr kiro is doing especially in the maori community there is a lot more open talking abut child maltreatment its something you would have not heard a year ago once our trust got up and running and started talking about it it started a conversation all over the country
1691179 last time round in ikaroa rawhiti there were 34 000 on the roll 10 000 didnt vote and when you consider the seat was won by less than 2000 votes you can see that five times the majority was wasted because people didnt go and vote
1691180 a lot of it was what birds they were able to gather some of course the paradise duck and the toroa the albatross feathers being beautiful white they bordered either side of the korowai that represented the sand the kokota spit at parengarenga harbour because auntie nina was born at te hapua that was where her family the normans were living it was symbolic of the life cycle of a woman in that environment
1691181 id like it to sent my works address as there will be no one at home to recieve it the work address is
1691182 please package the books carefully as the rap records 1st ed book you sent me before was a disgrace please wrap the book in paper or preferably corrugated card
1691183 please mark the package as a gift and value 20
1691184 id like it to sent my works address as there will be no one at home to recieve it the work address is
1691185 in many ways weve seen the enemy and it is us
1691186 were not willing to pay for better services yet we fully expect them
1691187 they cant raise fares because they have no pricing control
1691188 its not that they dont have the courage it would be business suicide to fall out of lockstep
1691189 the three biggest enemies to airlines today are fuel costs the internet and southwest a smart lean mean flying machine
1691190 one thing worse than high fares is no fares because youve lost airline service
1691191 it might be better to tolerate higher fares now so we dont end up with fewer carriers and less competition in the marketplace
1691192 technology has moved from the 1990s and no hotel provides clocks in the rooms anymore
1691193 the single biggest problem with communications is the illlusion its taken place
1691194 its an educational sale people need to learn about this product
1691195 we were not encouraged to produce bigger volume of crop as there was neither a coordinated market place to sell our products nor warehouse facilities to store the surplus from our sales
1691196 our product got the least grade which strengthened our resolve to produce quality products with higher grades
1691197 when farmers have better market incentives and can manage risk better they can produce more ethiopia will be much less prone to food crises
1691198 he was a fountain of knowledge about world war ii but he didnt think much of the steve mcqueen film
1691199 he said the film left out a lot of the reality of digging the tunnels he wasnt one of americas greatest fans and said it wasnt like it was in the film at all and that the scene with the motorbike was rubbish
1691200 many of dads close colleagues died during the war seven of them murdered so what to many people is an epic wartime film was to him a serious event
1691201 the main part of his brief when he was in the camp was digging the tunnels but he was also a great forger of documents and prepared fantastic maps
1691202 i am immensely proud of his achievements and its wonderful he contributed to saving britain and europe
1691203 he was a very very brave man to go through what he did a truly great man
1691204 we cannot control the economic environment in which we operate as a result of the recent slowdown in the television advertising market the board has taken some tough decisions
1691205 on current estimates the television advertising market has weakened in september where tough year on year comparisons apply given the rugby world cup in 2007
1691206 its not going to be so much a dash as a fairly well defined march
1691207 there are clearly set out regulations by the united nations as to what they are entitled to its not quite the free for all that has been suggested
1691208 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1691209 is old skool journalism any good in the era of blogging
1691210 i wonder if theres a chance the vast money surplus iraq now has from oil profits
1691211 the chocolate ration has been increased to 2 grams although subversive elements will try and convince you that the ration used to be 3 grams any you hear complaining about the ration increase must be reported
1691212 aww look whos left you take him no you take him
1691213 this is really a surprise because i didnt think it was going to be such a big deal
1691214 were not claiming that terrorists are able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way
1691215 we take security and privacy very seriously which is why the british biometric passport meets international standards as set out by the international civil aviation organisation and we remain confident that it is one of the most secure passports available
1691216 continuing investment in biometric technology and enhanced security measures will help ensure that passport security is maintained now and in the future
1691217 it will force me to steal in order to survive because of these high prices
1691218 there is no public transport the mining industry is closing down
1691219 i do support the message not the strike they shouldnt have stopped the transport
1691220 the issues they raised are not populist they are realistic and they are surmountable
1691221 on the other hand if we ignore the plight of the poor people were going to do it at our peril because this is a cry from the working and poor classes to do something dramatic
1691222 dank der neuen luft zu boden technologie sind breitbandverbindungen in der passagierkabine zum ersten mal f r private fluggesellschaften erschwinglich geworden
1691223 die karten wurden neu gemischt und delta wird eine der ersten airlines sein die ihren kunden auf den ber 1 000 t glichen amerikanischen inlandsfl gen schnelles wlan anbieten kann
1691224 the first spring water developed especially to tackle the growing problem of high blood pressure
1691225 we concluded that the ad could discourage readers from seeking essential medical treatment for a serious medical condition
1691226 free spring water for every reader to help lower your blood pressure
1691227 every effort would be made to avoid a similar occurrence in future
1691228 i can certainly sympathise with michael when nasser resigned i was 22 just going into the captaincy very naive and nervous about my own tenure
1691229 having been in the job for four or five years now a lot of what he said resonated with me it was sad to see a man of his stature go
1691230 i think that weve seen all the build up to kp and itll be interesting to see how he handles the job over a period of time the england captaincy is an important voice in world cricket and michael always handled himself very well

1691232 theres a lot of people back home who feel quite strongly about the fact hes captain im sure there are a lot of english people who feel the same way but our job is to be professional take our emotions to one side and focus on the cricket
1691233 england have gone with a slightly aggressive team i think the workload their bowlers have had throughout the series has had a role in that
1691234 he harmison is a guy that you have to always be aware of when he gets it right he is certainly a handful for any batter
1691235 the fact that england have picked him shows he must be in their long term plans if you are going to pick a guy like steve you must see a future going forward to india and the ashes series
1691236 the last couple of days have been a massive high for all of us i said to the guys that we now have to get our feet back on the ground and concentrate on the job in hand at the oval

1691319 as a trade union balpa has quite rightly fought long and hard to protect the final salary pensions of its pilot members in british airways and other airlines
1691320 balpa is now seeking to close its own final salary pension to new entrants and to impose drastic changes to pension benefits for existing staff
1691321 no employer let alone a trade union should impose changes to terms and conditions of employment without the agreement of its own staff balpa would not tolerate such behaviour from an employer that it was dealing with and the gmb will not tolerate this from balpa
1691322 balpa is extremely disappointed that the gmb has decided to proceed with a strike despite balpa making improved offers and without the gmb even consulting its members on those offers
1691323 we campaign against airlines not only because they have been closing defined benefit pension schemes but they have been imposing very inferior defined contribution schemes for new employees
1691324 balpa has offered new employees a first rate defined contributions scheme which is so good that the gmb negotiators originally recommended it there is a huge difference and it is grossly unfair to accuse balpa of hypocrisy as gmb now does

1691333 wherever ive coached ive been blessed with having a good natural centre
1691334 a centre is key because hes also responsible for his lines defensive play
1691335 these days guys are much more interchangeable with the only confusion deciding who picks up loose pucks along the boards but its much easier to make centres out of wingers than wingers out of centres

1691421 when we filmed this it was like seeing the real event happen again the acting in this scene was really magnificent while filming i just sat there with tears in my eyes fortunately when i looked around me i realised that everyone else on the sets were crying as well
1691422 peter was instrumental in helping hansie to begin the process of rebuilding his life
1691423 it was incredibly tough in a sense it felt like i went through my own king commission at a stage especially the last week in november last year when we heard that the funding was not there was difficult fortunately some very capable businessmen got involved without their assistance it would have been almost impossible the fact the movie has been successfully completed has helped a lot
1691424 we decided to use actors to play the parts of hansies team mates like allan donald and jonty rhodes
1691425 as the movie is primarily a drama it was important that we have experienced actors to ensure that the cricket action was done well we cast younger cricket players from a few different academies in south africa and india i was on the sets to ensure that the cricket sequences look real
1691426 the international cricket council icc were happy for us to continue knowing that the csa endorsed it
1691427 i think they were happy to see that we did not choose to try and uncover any more match fixing dirt rather we chose to tell the story of hansies internal journey
1691428 explore with the iccs management the scheduling of the tournament
1691429 the critical thing that needs to be understood about the champions league is that it is a domestic competition an invitational event involving best teams from various continents and that distinguishes it quite significantly from international events and icc events
1691430 ashwell has shown in this series that hes a match winner and the fact that hes already in england with his family added to the attraction of signing him
1691431 hes in form and its always good to sign a player who is playing with confidence hell join us at a vital stage of the season and add quality to our middle order
1691432 nottinghamshire are in contention for silverware and im confident that i can add some experience to the team at an important stage of the season
1691433 i know that i am joining a competitive team and i have kept my eye on the results ever since the interest was expressed
1691434 fuck its tuesday i need copy by tonight fuck fuck fuck hey whats this people not finishing books hmmm
1691435 the guy with the moustache in that scene hes a great character actor i was really pleased to get him involved i think hes very convincing as a frightened ordinary joe in this scene
1691436 yeah tim condale great guy he really adds a lot to this scene
1691437 gordon a democrat endorsed mccain in the presidential primary though
1691438 die aussicht schon sehr bald die t ren zur welt von war zu ffnen erf llt uns mit begeisterung
1691439 w hrend die entwicklung von warhammer online immer mehr fahrt aufnahm haben wir alles getan das erscheinen optimal vorzubereiten wir haben eine gewaltige server infrastruktur aufgebaut millionen w rter lokalisiert und ein erstklassiges team von experten auf ihrem gebiet rekrutiert jetzt freuen wir uns den spa den wir auf den schlachtfeldern von war haben zu teilen
1691440 unless there is real federal involvement and a massive infrastructure repair program like all of the g7 and developed nations have done not only will we become a third rate economic power but public safety and our quality of life are going to be endangered as well
1691441 what we need is we need leadership from the other end of pennsylvania avenue and in both sides of the aisle in congress to have a grand scheme what are we trying to accomplish what do we want this country to look like two decades from now and then how do we get there
1691442 folktales are an entertaining way to deal with the everyday issues that people face although the tales may be couched in stories about animals and peasants the types of human characters and behaviors described are universal
1691443 choose and adapt whatever works best in your own work situation
1691444 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1691445 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1691446 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1691447 these prosecutions demonstrate that through coordinated commitment the united states secret service and the department of justice will penetrate and prosecute hacker organizations wherever based and however sophisticated the united states attorneys office for the southern district of california is especially gratified that the work of the san diego field office of the secret service contributed to an unprecedented effort to dismantle this international criminal enterprise
1691448 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1691449 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1691450 technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted virtually erasing geographic boundaries
1691451 while these advances and the global nature of cyber crime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside
1691452 the internal revenue service criminal investigation division recommends charges in numerous types of financial crimes
1691453 todays indictment is the result of a strong law enforcement partnership that brings together the necessary skills to follow alleged criminal activity from cyberspace to bank accounts we are committed to the governments efforts to stop this type of corruptive activity
1691454 what people dont realize is these medications can pose a host of side effects including daytime drowsiness even bizarre behavior like sleep walking sleep eating and sleep driving there are alternative treatments such as sound machines that may be quite effective yet pose no risks at all
1691455 ultimately we wish to identify the precise dna sequence differences that exist among individuals and determine which cause variation in traits like height hair color and of course disease risk
1691456 our work will provide valuable insight into the genetic control of such traits using the powerful experimental tools available for the model organism drosophila melanogaster the fruit fly
1691457 stuarts work will lead to better techniques for identifying the genes that underlie complex diseases like cancer heart disease and diabetes
1691458 the identification of such genes is the critical first step in the development of both drugs that combat diseases progression and screening procedures to identify people at risk for the diseases
1691459 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1691460 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1691461 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1691462 we all saw he was down on pace last week so hes not fit at the moment and we decided to give him a bit of a break to get away from things but steve is buzzing properly buzzing you can see that little smile on his face and hell be given the responsibility to take the new ball tomorrow
1691463 its a positive move an aggressive move and its one where mooresy peter moores and i have come to sing off the same hymn sheet which is a good start for us its given the batters the responsibility to score the runs and freds happy at 6 i spoke to him and he said whatever you want to do im there for you which is great from the big man
1691464 bells going to get the responsibility at 3 and he wants that because hes played 40 odd test matches now and hes been everywhere from 1 to 7
1691465 flintoff the way hes batted for us this summer hes looked to build an innings and hes looked real real good he balances the side beautifully at 6 and with stuart at 8 thats a real strong side
1691466 its time to draw a line under whats happened and start again afresh
1691467 i think the recipe for success that ive tried to use is do it my way
1691468 passion is a big word but international cricket can roll into day in day out train and play train and play the big feature for us this week is to get back to playing with real pride and passion and get back to playing with confidence and without fear
1691469 ive always believed that if you win the toss and you want to bat you bat if you dont think youre sure you still bat and if youre really not sure you think for ten seconds then you still bat again thats what ive been told but ive never been a captain in a test match
1691470 it hasnt really sunk in properly yet but ive got to do the simple things right
1691471 ive been under pressure ever since i came to england eight years ago but i know what a great honour this is and im going to give it a real good go if i make a success of it i make a success of it but if i dont ill be man enough to know ive got to go back and bat
1691472 irfan is not being so influential and in addition to his loss of pace he is not even able to cut the ball and bowl well at death

1691483 a white elephant hybrid of time sink and pr sludge pump that pays hugely exposed writers such as stross and scalzi for content in the hope of sucking in our marketing eye balls strikes me as precisely what online sf does not need right now
1691484 youre seriously arguing that a social networking site set up by a publishing house that is largely unheard of outside of sf circles is a better way of sucking in new people than the utterly inclusive blogosphere and facebook
1691485 im sorry john but i cant see any basis for your argument other than wishful thinking and economic self interest
1691486 that we need an sf publishing house to provide us with an acceptable face is mildly offensive
1691487 my problem with tor com from the get go has been that its all about tor and not all about the community so i would suggest that the community does not need this new website
1691488 if your economic interest matters hardly at all then why did you mention how great it was that they were paying a decent per word rate
1691489 youre coming across as slightly nuts writing huge long posts defending a site whose main characteristics you are either not interested in or which you hope will change with time
1691490 i get the impression that while youre not actually crazy about the site you really dont think that people should be slagging it off
1691491 this does put some of your hostility into a more sane context its not just a story sale its regular income
1691492 youre not nuts because of what youre saying youre nuts because of the level of hostility youre writing at which seems utterly out of proportion with anything that i have actually said though to be fair this isnt the first time youve flown off the handle at me
1691493 in fact now that it has gone up my main complaint is that tor com is uninspiring the staffing in particular is quite lazy as the powers that be have gone for name recognition alone
1691494 a ill be impressed when they start buying stuff from lesser known people i dont think youre at the point in your career when you have problems selling stories at this point people are competing to get your work forgive me if i dont get moist at the thought of you being slightly better paid
1691495 any hardcore sf reader who suddenly discovers they like paranormal romance should immediately see a psychiatrist
1691496 what we need is not more connection it is more filtering and more paying venues for the serious content that many of us put out for free
1691497 after identifying a new breed of accountants last year we can now see a facebook generation of accountants who have become increasingly tech savvy getting more and more comfortable with technology in the workplace as well as in private

1691507 the introduction of these new programs helps address evolving online threats and provides more practical guidance to assess and manage risk
1691508 in the race between exploit and protection microsoft is committed to shifting the advantage to the security industry the microsoft active protections program gives security software providers the information and resources they need to help better protect customers
1691509 as security threats become more sophisticated the global security community must combine its resources and work together to provide maximum security protections to worldwide internet users
1691510 no one organization can counter online attacks alone therefore we must use the combined strength of the industry partners customers and public organizations to build a more secure environment for everyone
1691511 the combination of x3d and collada form a powerful pipeline for reusing cad data these complementary approaches will finally bridge the gap between cad systems and web deployment of cad derived applications such as interactive training manuals parts catalogs and interactive walkthroughs
1691512 collada 1 5 concretizes the convergence between the game industry and the cad automation industries with the introduction of boundary representation brep and inverse kinematics in a standard used by most developers in the game industry the liaison with web3d strengthens this convergence particularly for the 3d web
1691513 kaist has worked for many years to improve cad model interchange using history based parametric translation between different software formats this work has contributed to step the international standard for the exchange of product model data iso 10303 as part of iso technical committee tc 184 sc 4 we look forward to further extending cad model export and interoperability with x3d
1691514 the cci engine will dramatically improve fuel efficiency and design dimensions in numerous markets using conventional fuels while simultaneously enabling renewable fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol by reducing the amount of land required to supply the worlds energy needs
1691515 we believe the engine will be particularly attractive in the marine automotive aerospace military and trucking industries
1691516 the cci engine has the potential to bring revolutionary improvements in terms of power density to the diesel engine industry it has an excellent chance for successful technical development in delivering a lightweight compact highly fuel efficient multi fuel potential and possibly relatively low cost of manufacture on a per horsepower basis alternative to traditional engines
1691517 people like to talk about a lot of different ways of solving our energy crisis in america but these new alternatives require radical changes in design infrastructure or other mass economic factors no other alternative can deliver it with a piston driven engine that runs on todays fuels as well as renewable fuels of the future thats the hope and future of the cci engine

1691550 one of the biggest challenges in the fight against influenza is producing new vaccines every year

1691553 players are individuals and respond best to an individually customized gaming experience no longer must players wander the casino in search of a suitable game when a player sits down at a game built with personalized gaming technology its characteristics automatically adapt to that specific players personality
1691554 each game behaves differently for each player personalized gaming technology revolutionizes the casino floor by delivering heightened emotional gratification to players while simultaneously increasing play volume and profits for casinos this requires a truly advanced and extensible platform on which to run ballys alpha game platform combined with its networked floor of the future tm is the first platform powerful enough to deliver the promise of personalized gaming just as importantly ballys organization possesses open minded foresight and demonstrated accomplishment im amazed at how much bally has advanced over the past three years were thrilled to have bally as a partner

1691585 what happens with animals when their skin is ripped from their bodies when they are still alive its heartbreaking for me
1691586 we werent making a political attack on the chinese government and had sent our press release in advance to the beijing committee but apparently that was not enough
1691587 im not trying to be in everybodys face and be harsh or negative i want to be calm and yet get my voice out there im doing it for all those animals who dont have a voice
1691588 the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales

1691590 im going to go with four fast bowlers and monty panesar
1691591 i think it is an aggressive move a positive move we need to take 20 wickets in this test you need to take 20 in any test and i feel a lot more comfortable with four fast bowlers
1691592 weve given responsibility to the batters to score runs with colly paul collingwood at five freddie andrew flintoff at six timmy ambrose seven and broad eight
1691593 i like steve and what he brings to the team hes had his ups and downs but i have a really good relationship with steve
1691594 he seems as excited as anything and he had a bit of a bounce in his step
1691595 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1691596 they now realise and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organising committee
1691597 it probably wasnt the most opportune time for these athletes to wear these masks they were overly cautious
1691598 unfortunately you never want to go to somebody elses place and cause any embarrassment but in this case i think they did
1691599 we didnt realise the impact that wearing the masks would have
1691600 from our standpoint it was to take care of a perceived health risk in reality it came across as offensive we dont want to insult bocog or the chinese public
1691601 we would not prevent athletes if they want to wear a mask and feel it is in their best interests to do so it is their right to do so
1691602 i was blown away when i was told it was a big surprise and a huge honour its fantastic
1691603 some of the most wonderful names in british sport have been olympic flag bearers
1691604 i really wanted to be picked but i didnt totally believe i would be
1691605 making the olympic games this time around was fantastic in itself but this has really topped it off its phenomenal
1691606 the olympic games are being used as a propaganda tool by the chinese government to whitewash their human rights record
1691607 i have invited you to see a movie that a friend asked me to show to you
1691608 to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
1691609 the chinese government is using the beijing olympics in an attempt to legitimise its brutal occupation of tibet and cover up its human rights record
1691610 we are here in solidarity with tibetans to support their cries for human rights and freedom
1691611 at this critical moment we hope to shine the olympic spotlight on chinas occupation of tibet
1691612 the chinese leadership must take immediate steps towards a peaceful end to its occupation of tibet

1691680 the many screen tests evidence a variety of behavior of its portrait subjects but amazingly little improvisation
1691681 the resulting films drastically reduced the roles of director and viewer alike the directors function was limited to choosing the subject setting up the shot turning the camera on and off and deciding whether or not to exhibit the result and the viewer for the first time in the history of the commercial exploitation of persistence of vision was relieved of the obligation perhaps even a large part of the desire to pay attention to the screen the standard film as wallpaper definition of the early warhol films doesnt stand up since their entire meaning and effect spring from the fact of their projection on a screen in a darkened room

1691721 spotty rain showers have brought relief to some areas but the moisture gained is quickly lost under continuous high temperatures and hot winds some producers are supplementing pastures with hay stream flow continues to decline producers have started to sell off calves early
1691722 dry conditions persisted last week some livestock producers are expressing concerns about declining water availability also limited supplemental feeding has occurred due to deteriorating pasture situation
1691723 corn silage is being harvested as corn fields dry down very quickly some corn fields for grain look very good and some show signs of poor pollination and poor ear fill extremely variable rains produced good fields across the road from fields that show signs of major moisture stress soybeans are beginning to flower and start pods we need some good generalized rains to keep the flowers on the plants and insure good pod fill the county has not experienced anything but spotty relatively small thunderstorms for almost four weeks many pastures and hayfields are browning out and soybeans are showing signs of wilting in mid afternoon sun
1691724 many vegetables are making it to local farmer markets and they are being consumed many folks are calling extension offices to get information on canning and freezing early in the week damage from the sunday thunderstorm with hail and high winds were assessed in the northeast corner of the county tobacco corn soybeans were damaged the most the high temperatures are taking a toll on crops livestock and producers some areas of the county got rain on thursday afternoon with friday once again being hot
1691725 farmers are applying herbicide applications on cotton and soybeans some application of fungicide was applied on peanuts the county experienced spotty showers for the week some very isolated places received about 2 inches the majority of the county needs a good soaking rain
1691726 we received frequent summer showers this week which helped to alleviate the lack of rain we experienced early on corn crop is limited by now soybean crop has been hurt by both dry soils and wet soils depending if you were in an area which had to be replanted because of drought or conversely received 12 plus inches of rain in july which drowned plants in the field some acres of alfalfa spoiled because of unexpected rain that fell after it was cut there is always a challenge with summer humidity and thunderstorms summer produce is readily available now no major pest causing concerns at this time crop scouts are now busy looking for insect and disease problems we expect to see as conditions become favorable for those pests
1691727 potato harvest is winding up this is a good year there are some farmers planting fall crops such as snap beans and butterbeans farmers are actively scouting soybean crop for worms spider mites and other pests farmers are requesting information on wheat seed some were already ordering seed for fall some corn companies delivering brochures and taking orders for 2009 corn seed a few farmers are taking a short vacation corn needs significant rain badly we are having a brief thunderstorm in some areas
1691728 farming activities included weed control in soybeans attending ag field days irrigating if possible praying for rain bush hogging around fields vacations scaring deer out of soybeans and blackbirds out of corn fields
1691729 localized showers have benefited some farms therefore those crops are progressing well in the areas not receiving so much precipitation pastures and hayfields are struggling corn planted early is growing well in most areas farmers are seeing significant amounts of disease problems on tomato cucurbits and various fruit crops
1691730 severe hail storm on saturday hit the southeastern part of madison county that defoliated the corn crop injured soybeans and caused a lot of tree damage vce is in the process of estimating the damages
1691731 dry weather during the week plagued parts of augusta county south and east particularly corn has been exhibiting drought stress and those who can irrigate have been soybeans have improved somewhat where stands were established the northwestern part of the county on into rockingham and the northern valley are very good
1691732 apple and peach growers within the county are finding more damage as a result of last weeks storms
1691733 basically we havent changed the way we manage these test plots since 1999 so most of the increase is due to genetic improvement even more surprisingly is an annual increase of nearly a pound of test weight over the past eight years
1691734 these varieties performed well regardless of whether they were grown using conventional tillage or no till growers should be optimistic that included among these top varieties are early mid and late maturing lines
1691735 we are not using the time for tillage but a good tradeoff in no till systems is to use that time to check planters and seed depth and performance frequently instead of building a seedbed growers need to use that time to adjust equipment to manage the seedbed they have in no till systems

1691935 however fewer than 10 per cent of families choose this option instead preferring fortnightly payments despite the associated churn
1691936 churning of income support recipients with private income has increased since the 1980s as income support payments have risen from below the tax free threshold to well above it

1692010 we are delighted to have the opportunity to work with purdue on this exciting and potentially transformational research into nuclear fuels
1692011 we fundamentally believe that multi oxide and beo fuels are the way of the future and will be the foundation of a more efficient economically sound and safer nuclear power industry by supporting purdues ongoing nuclear fuels research
1692012 we aim to make an advanced uo2 beo fuel commercially accessible and to enhance the value of our strategic assets for both our shareholders and the nuclear fuels industry
1692013 could very possibly be used in current nuclear power reactors as well as next generation reactors which are already in the prototype stage for either type of reactor
1692014 multioxide high thermal conductivity fuels are much safer as well as being more efficient requiring the fuel rods to be changed less frequently
1692015 although todays oxide fuels are very stable and safe a major problem is that they do not conduct heat well limiting the power and causing fuel pellets to crack and degrade prematurely necessitating replacement before the fuel has been entirely used the beryllium oxide is like a heat pipe that sucks the heat out and helps to more efficiently cool the fuel pellet if you can operate at a lower temperature you can use the fuel pellets for a longer time burning up more of the fuel which is very important from an economic point of view lower temperatures also mean safer more flexible reactor operation

1692333 we are excited to begin this water recycling pilot program with devon energy and look forward to helping conserve vital water resources to produce clean energy
1692334 devon will contract with ecosphere technologies of stuart fla to operate the pilot project in johnson county the project will use a pre treatment process to remove waste constituents before the water is run through a series of membranes to remove salts the process will also treat produced water that is released from the shale with natural gas the recycled water will then be reused to hydraulically fracture the barnett shale formation the water treatment system is projected to produce 75 percent reusable fracture fluid and 25 percent high concentrate and solids the concentrate will be used as a drilling fluid or disposed of in an authorized facility
1692335 advanced drilling and fracturing technology has been critical to making the barnett shale one of the nations top natural gas fields however fresh water used to fracture the shale becomes a waste product when it picks up salt metals and hydrocarbons in the formation oil and gas field waste reduction is a priority at the commission and i commend devon and other operators who continue to seek ways to reduce frac fluid and produced water waste
1692336 the process being tested in this unique pilot program will use a low energy and low cost pre treatment system to remove most of the contaminates before the water is filtered through membranes innovations like this system will help the oil and gas industry to find economical ways to transform a waste product into a reusable fluid

1692386 strategies that are effective for protecting critical business data that reside on servers may not be effective for laptop and desktop computers and vice versa
1692387 protecting data in both places can be complex and challenging but failure to implement a solution that provides a business with total data protection could result in catastrophic data loss and in the worst case may even mean the failure of the business that is why the combined offering of yosemite filekeeper corporate for transparent continuous data protection for the edge of the network and inmage dr scout for well accepted core protection is a powerful solution
1692388 based on the companys flagship dr scout product with technology that combines disaster recovery with cdp and solves other issues such as branch office consolidation the decision to partner with inmage was intuitive
1692389 corporations have seen the need for laptop protection for years but because of the complexity of most laptop protection products they have left it up to the users to copy files to a file share with the simplicity of filekeeper corporate and the combination with dr scout customers can be assured that their information is always protected
1692390 yosemites filekeeper corporate solution is well known for its set it and forget it ease of use for protecting desktops and laptops
1692391 combining this with robust bc dr for production servers and applications will provide customers with unprecedented data protection from the core to the edge of their network as well as a high level of peace of mind

1692404 this doctrine justification by faith is the head and the cornerstone it alone begets nourishes builds preserves and defends the church of god and without it the church of god cannot exist for one hour for no one who does not hold this article or to use pauls expression this sound doctrine titus 2 1 is able to teach aright in the church or successfully to resist any adversary this is the heel of the seed that opposes the old serpent and crushes its head that is why satan in turn cannot but persecute it
1692405 whoever departs from the article of justification does not know god and is an idolater for when this article has been taken away nothing remains but error hypocrisy godlessness and idolatry although it may seem to be the height of truth worship of god holiness etc
1692406 of this article justification nothing may be yielded or conceded though heaven and earth and whatever will not abide fall to ruin for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved says st peter acts 4 12 and with his stripes we are healed is 53 5 and on this article all that we teach and practice is based against the pope the devil and the world that is why we must be very certain of this doctrine and not doubt otherwise all is lost and the pope and the devil and all things gain the victory over us and are adjudged right
1692407 in short if this article concerning christ the doctrine that we are justified and saved through him alone and consider all apart from him damned is not professed all resistance and restraint are at an end then there is in fact neither measure nor limit to any heresy and error
1692408 now the real nature of calvinistic soteriology becomes plain it is no artificial oddity nor a product of overbold logic its central confession that god saves sinners that christ redeemed us by his blood is the witness both of the bible and of the believing heart the calvinist is the christian who confesses before men in his theology just what he believes in his heart before god when he prays he thinks and speaks at all times of the sovereign grace of god in the way that every christian does when he pleads for the souls of others or when he obeys the impulse of worship which rises unbidden within him prompting him to deny himself all praise and to give all the glory of his salvation to his savior calvinism is the natural theology written on the heart of the new man in christ whereas arminianism is an intellectual sin of infirmity natural only in the sense in which all such sins are natural even to the regenerate calvinistic thinking is the christian being himself on the intellectual level arminian thinking is the christian failing to be himself through the weakness of the flesh calvinism is what the christian church has always held and taught when its mind has not been distracted by controversy and false traditions from attending to what scripture actually says that is the significance of the patristic testimonies to the teaching of the five points which can be quoted in abundance so that really it is most misleading to call this soteriology calvinism at all for it is not a peculiarity of john calvin and the divines of dort but a part of the revealed truth of god and the catholic christian faith calvinism is one of the odious names by which down the centuries prejudice has been raised against it but the thing itself is just the biblical gospel
1692409 i have my own private opinion that there is no such thing as preaching christ and him crucified unless we preach what nowadays is called calvinism it is a nickname to call it calvinism calvinism is the gospel and nothing else i do not believe we can preach the gospel if we do not preach justification by faith without works nor unless we preach the sovereignty of god in his dispensation of grace nor unless we exalt the electing unchangeable eternal immutable conquering love of jehovah nor do i think we can preach the gospel unless we base it upon the special and particular redemption of his elect and chosen people which christ wrought out upon the cross nor can i comprehend a gospel which lets saints fall away after they are called and suffers the children of god to be burned in the fires of damnation after having once believed in jesus such a gospel i abhor

1692469 this was a quarter of solid product development progress for the company and its collaborative partners
1692470 we were excited to be recommended for government funding for a project targeting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als more widely known as lou gehrigs disease a devastating disease with significant unmet need potentially adding up to 2 4 million to fund the projects preclinical development costs also research from two of our partnered programs was presented and published this quarter dr robin alis team at university college of london reported promising results in an early stage aav based clinical trial in lebers congenital amaurosis lca an inherited eye disease that impairs vision and eventually causes blindness and was published in the new england journal of medicine dr beverly davidson at university of iowa was recognized in pnas for advances in delivery of small interfering rna to the brain and represents a significant advance in addressing this treatment method in huntingtons disease
1692471 additional studies are underway in order to assess this approach fully but these initial results suggest that aav based delivery of genes in the eye can be accomplished safely and with promise
1692472 these new aav rnai vectors embedded in synthetic micro rna structures retain the efficiency of delivery and biologic efficacy while having a greatly enhanced safety profile
1692473 we believe this new design concept is of great importance to the entire rna therapeutic field and that the use of aav vectors for the delivery of expressed rnai has proven advantages over alternative rnai delivery approaches due to aavs long term expression capabilities stability and safety profile
1692474 these results in huntingtons and in lca continue to support our beliefs that aav delivery holds great promise in the creation of a broad new class of innovative medicines and that targeted genetics is well positioned to participate in this opportunity

1692490 kentuckians like all americans are hard hit by record high gas prices
1692491 these tough times call for creative solutions and i believe allowing kentuckians the option of using an electric vehicle is one of those solutions electric vehicles may help ease the burden on the pocketbooks of hard working kentucky families as well as reduce their carbon footprint
1692492 never have we received such hospitality and such overwhelming enthusiasm for electric vehicles as exhibited by the governor and every single person we met while in kentucky

1692522 we experienced outstanding test results from our two megawatt stationary battery developed for the aes corporation
1692523 the independent report prepared by kema has validated that our battery did everything that it was designed to do these test results have created a significant amount of interest in our product and its capabilities for solving existing problems in the electric grid particularly as suppliers look for cost effective solutions to their capacity and energy management issues
1692524 we have also recently reached an agreement with phoenix mc inc that has resolved all of our outstanding issues with them
1692525 they will use our original generation 1 batteries in their first 50 demonstration vehicles with the addition of a new safety system being added by phoenix we continue to work with phoenix on the definition of a new longer term supply agreement and are excited about the potential in this market

1692534 la discarica di chiaiano si far e dico si allesercito gli strumenti per uscire dallemergenza cerano anche al tempo del governo prodi ma non si potevano usare il piglio e la decisione di berlusconi hanno fatto la differenza
1692535 pero allora ammette il governatore certi strumenti penso allutilizzo dellesercito non potevano essere messi in campo quella di prodi era una maggioranza troppo eterogenea contraddittoria le soluzioni le avevamo prospettate anche allora solo che non potevamo esercitare i nostri poteri per i continui veti che alcuni rappresentanti dellallora coalizione ci imponevano

1692537 servira certamente una campagna di comunicazione efficace per rilanciare limmagine della citta
1692538 quando si afferma che la discarica di chiaiano occuper un solo ettaro su 2200 mi vengono in mente quelle pubblicit ingannevoli in cui necessaria la lente dingrandimento per scovare cavilli svantaggiosi per lacquirente dice il primo cittadino occorrerebbe infatti precisare che quando si indicano 2200 ettari si sta parlando di una zona che va dai camaldoli ai pisani da san rocco alla selva di chiaiano dallo scudillo alle masserie di chiaiano vale a dire unarea in cui vivono 104 689 persone come riporta lo stesso sito del parco delle colline citando peraltro come fonte i dati istat del 1991 e dal 1991 ad oggi la popolazione residente presumo sia cresciuta

1692541 there have been a number of anecdotes that dogs catch human yawns
1692542 but no one had ever conducted a rigorous study of it
1692543 humans and dogs have been living together for thousands of years so we shouldnt be surprised that were responsive to each others behavior
1692544 to conclude that dogs have a form of empathy would be best supported by a demonstration of other forms of empathy such as recognizing that a person is suffering

1692551 people recommend finding another job but that is not always easy to do and moving is stressful too it is still putting someone out of a routine
1692552 if people are ruminating about it their situation over and over and dont have an opportunity to get away from it they should seek some professional evaluation
1692553 they should keep their resume up to date and keep their employment network in the picture

1692583 this drought is worse than the violence how can we survive without water
1692584 it really is heart wrenching to see the iraqi people be driven to go through so much
1692585 theyve had multiple wars they have had this insurgency and terrorist action and now theyve got to contend with the drought
1692586 theyre used to the canal system of just pulling water off the tigris river or the euphrates river or out of the hamreen lake and they dont have that option this year
1692587 so our agriculture reps from usaid and the state department are trying to get them some new technologies were doing the same thing were working with texas a amp m university to get some experts in the field of how to grow crops with saving water
1692588 im afraid in iraq we dont have that culture yet
1692589 i dont hide it there is a lot of waste but we have started taking actions
1692590 now we have some serious consultations with turkey and syria
1692591 with iran im afraid our contacts and our cooperation has not reached the necessary level
1692592 if julius caesar had had nuclear reactors wed still be managing the waste
1692593 we have a legal and moral obligation to get yucca mountain opened and operating
1692594 currently 55 000 metric tons of commercial spent nuclear fuel and defense high level waste is being stored at more than 100 above ground sites in 39 states and that number grows by about 2 000 metric tons annually by entombing it deep in yucca mountain a safe and secure permanent geologic repository we can ensure public safety for thousands of generations

1692629 credit related expenses were far higher than what guidance had been
1692630 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1692631 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1692632 we have to prepare for a stress condition that looks worse than that
1692633 the flip side is that these fees have a cost
1692634 originators are the ones that have to pay these up front fees and the originators need to be compensated they most likely will turn around to the borrowers and factor those higher fees into higher mortgage rates
1692635 whats the effect all else being equal it has the effect of pushing mortgage rates higher which is not exactly conducive to generating new business

1692642 what this organization is all about is balancing among the different missions
1692643 we thought that was the right judgment to make given the information we had at that point in time
1692644 we decided to give up market share rather than to chase it

1692653 the most important message i d like to send right now is that spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward
1692654 we have flight four of falcon 1 almost ready for flight and flight five right behind that i have also given the go ahead to begin fabrication of flight six falcon 9 development will also continue unabated taking into account the lessons learned with falcon 1
1692655 w rden wir rafinha rausrei en h tte er den kopf nicht frei
1692656 if you are unable to map your drive contact your system administrator or refer to the topic setting up the cifs server in the installation guide
1692657 in this place before the walls of the old city whose destruction we are marking these days i promise to maintain a united jerusalem as israels eternal capital
1692658 our biggest question right now is getting our life support systems working so we have enough for six person crew
1692659 right now were running kind of a water deficit and its being supplemented by the shuttle
1692660 by getting the crew quarters deployed well have extra bedrooms
1692661 that water is going to be used not just for drinking and food preparation but also for oxygen generation
1692662 and i think thats a key component of life support because i think were all addicted to breathing
1692663 recycling will be an essential part of daily life for future astronauts whether on board the space station or living on the moon
1692664 delivering this hardware is an important step in achieving the stations full potential allowing for additional crew members and more scientific research
1692665 there were allegations by a member of parliament the minister of finance instructed me to meet with the mp and today we are listening to batelcos board to hear both sides
1692666 from there we determine if there is a need for any issues to be investigated
1692667 each and every allegation will be investigated by batelcos board
1692668 it is unfortunate that a number of unsubstantiated allegations have been made under parliamentary privilege aimed to discredit one of the most successful companies in bahrain
1692669 can anyone believe someone who earns 5 347 dinars a month should get 11 34 million dinars just to keep him for six months
1692670 a bogus scheme of 1 5 million dinars to improve the structure of batelcos services has never been checked by the companys projects committee not assessed by the purchase department not presented to the board which approved it although the name of the supplier was fake
1692671 i certainly will be having an eagle eye on the banks when it comes to their reaction should those decisions to cut rates be taken
1692672 we dont have any formal mechanisms to force the banks to do that
1692673 i think if theres any problem the government has when i say a problem i dont think its a problem necessarily it is to not have an overarching narrative in place
1692674 frenetic activity in the end suiting journos running at the behest of little press secretaries doesnt pay off
1692675 you cant get around in asia saying oh by the way we borrowed the monarch of another country the queen of great britain is our head of state
1692676 john howard turned the prime ministership into something like a state police minister hes at the scene of every crime twice a day on radio the guy did no thinking
1692677 with habitats under increasing threat conservation seed banking is an important strategy for both storing and understanding genetically important wild seeds
1692678 this experiment could lead to some ground breaking research by providing a preliminary evaluation of space station seed banking a possible option for the future
1692679 an insurance policy for the world could be to have some seeds up in space as well
1692680 one of the things that has been reported from china is that the radiation has led to giant vegetables and changes in the genetic structure
1692681 our hypothesis is that the trip in space for six months wont have any major impact on these very tough resilient seeds
1692682 they might be the sort of things we would take up into space not only for food but also if were looking at producing oxygen in space or setting up micro climates
1692683 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
1692684 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
1692685 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
1692686 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
1692687 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
1692688 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security

1692695 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
1692696 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism
1692697 i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story
1692698 people are just cruel this is bad karma for him
1692699 my main message to parents is that they should not be taking medical advice from me or any other celebrity they should look to their pediatrician the american academy of pediatrics and other experts
1692700 she knows she is putting her health at risk if she dismisses the advice of her doctors and has another c section
1692701 this is the best news ive heard in a long time
1692702 everybody is rooting for her and thats a good thing im on that bandwagon too i dont want to see anybody unhappy
1692703 i dont think that we could do a series but id do a special patsy would be completely fossilised by now shed be in formaldehyde
1692704 i havent met him yet but cried when i found out james mcavoy was married literally
1692705 after mtv came along people were seeing their favorite singers in videos and suddenly there was a certain vision of a song how it should sound how it should look then in concert there was no room for improvisation everyone wanted an exact replica
1692706 they dont speak they dont talk to their audience they may say hello new york or hello las vegas in the beginning and thank you in between songs but they dont talk they dont tell stories or take the time to make a connection build a rapport theres no emotion
1692707 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged

1692719 its the venue of all serious minded films at the toronto film festival meant for a discerning audience last year the coen brothers no country for old men premiered there this year im proud to have my film there in the special representation section
1692720 and thats when preity will dub her portion of the film in hindi
1692721 the entire cast barring preity is from toronto they can only speak english and punjabi
1692722 preity will have to do her portions in toronto after her world tour with the bachchans and also attend the toronto festival screening
1692723 and on no account should any one disguise himself in mohammedan clothing or deny being a christian the mohammedans have respect for real christians and believe their word the arabs estimate the character of strangers by their acts which they closely watch and not by their speech which seldom reveals the real character of man
1692724 the ferag finishing lines we have acquired recently give us the opportunity to relocate finishing from greaves to our other print sites thereby improving efficiency and reducing transportation
1692725 this closure represented another hammer blow to the print and packaging industry which is already reeling from the closures of curtis and beith and the announced job cuts at sappi and johnston press
1692726 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1692727 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means that im running for president
1692728 hes the oldest celebrity it the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1692729 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1692730 there are probably enough lonmin shareholders who want to sell out and invest in other mining plays the rejection does not mean that we wont see a takeover
1692731 we see the bid as opportunistic synergy driven and likely to succeed
1692732 we see very little chance of a counter bid and it is a case of who blinks first between xstrata and the lonmin shareholders
1692733 lonmin shareholders are rightly fed up with incumbent management and we feel they will definitely not back a go it alone strategy and will want to lose this offer
1692734 when managements are this unloved platinum group metals prices are weak and interloper risk is low xstrata have a fair chance of taking this home at the offer price
1692735 we believe there is a good chance that johnston press will announce a specific costs target or signal a significant exercise is under way to improve efficiency

1692748 authorizes unifil to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind to resist attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the mandate of the security council
1692749 calls upon the government of lebanon to secure its borders and other entry points to prevent the entry in lebanon without its consent of arms or related materiel

1692759 68 hat eine w chtergeneration hinterlassen man darf als jemand der einmal als dazugeh rig betrachtet wurde nicht glauben dass heute irgendetwas unbemerkt ge u ert oder auch nur gedacht werden k nnte ich bekomme e mails anrufe vorw rfe ber dritte es hei t ich sei ein abtr nniger und verr ter ich selbst war fr her auch so meinen schwiegervater der als jude und sozialdemokrat in buchenwald war habe ich als deutsch nationalen bonzen gebrandmarkt das bereue ich heute er war einer der wenigen wirklichen republikaner der als fraktionsf hrer im preu ischen landtag wusste dass man f r eine republik volk und nation braucht ein mann wie tucholsky hatte nur verachtung daf r er hat weimar nicht wirklich verteidigt
1692760 ich glaube es sind meine hypothesen ber die rolle des antifaschismus den ich heute untersuche wie ich in meiner doktorarbeit in den f nfziger jahren den rechtsradikalismus untersucht habe meines erachtens ist der antifaschismus ein moralisches herrschaftsmittel das der ausgrenzung von andersdenkenden dient ein so erfolgreiches instrument l sst man nat rlich nicht so ohne weiteres kritisieren die achtundsechziger sind es schlie lich gewohnt kultureller hegemon zu sein das macht dumm
1692761 ohne zweifel als kulturrevolution hat 68 gewonnen ihr siegespreis ist die politische korrektheit die allenthalben zu einer semantischen politik gef hrt hat nach ihrem sieg haben sich die achtundsechziger zur ckgelehnt sie glaubten nichts mehr dazulernen zu m ssen ihr problemstand kennzeichnet sich durch den inflation ren gebrauch der vorsilbe neo eine feindbezeichnung die alles beim alten l sst berall neoliberale und neokonservative bezeichnenderweise aber keine neosozialisten die gr ere lernchance in der geschichte haben wohl eher die verlierer
1692762 der historiker g tz aly hat zuletzt behauptet es gebe parallelen zwischen dem jahr 1968 und dem jahr 1933 stimmen sie damit berein
1692763 man kommt nicht umhin festzustellen dass der achtundsechziger bewegung etwas totalit res anhaftete
1692764 wie beurteilen sie lebenswege wie die von otto schily oder joseph fischer
1692765 im grunde sind sie wie die schullehrer nur mit mehr macht ausgestattet
1692766 das hatte mit meiner zusammenarbeit mit philosophen der akademie der wissenschaften in ostberlin zu tun dort sollten zwei von mir gesch tzte kollegen als abweichler aus der sed und der akademie ausgeschlossen werden von seiten der westdeutschen dkp setzte man mich unter druck die vorg nge an der akademie geheim zu halten die dkp wollte nicht dass es im westen zu einer diskussion ber die schwierigkeiten der intelligenz in der ddr kommt ich habe mich widersetzt mit meinem anspruch als linker aufkl rer war das nicht vereinbar ich besann mich auf den antikommunismus wie ich ihn in den f nfziger jahren kennengelernt hatte und konnte von da an als persona ingrata nicht mehr in die ddr einreisen
1692767 w rden sie jungen leuten dennoch empfehlen sich einen linken lebensabschnitt zu g nnen

1692769 ich empfinde das woran ich damals geglaubt habe heute als katastrophe ich komme einfach mit diversen aussagen im koran und im leben des propheten nicht zurecht
1692770 was wichtig ist dass wir am ende vor allah stehen und sagen wir haben alles getan um dein wort ber alle anderen w rter herrschen zu lassen um dein gesetz ber alle anderen gesetze herrschen zu lassen
1692771 ich empfinde das woran ich damals geglaubt habe heute als katastrophe ich komme einfach mit manchen aussagen im koran und im leben des propheten nicht zurecht

1692775 wenn man sterreichern zuh rt hat man oft den eindruck dass wir das jahr 1683 schreiben und die ottomanen gerade erst von wien abgezogen sind man sollte das thema nicht dramatisieren sondern m glichst n chtern und rational damit umgehen

1692778 batelco has previously promised its business customers to offer new and upgraded deals on broadband services with drastic reductions now we are delivering on our promises
1692779 batelco understands the needs of its customers for faster cheaper and reliable broadband services through the business benefits campaign batelco is striving to offer its business customers better internet services at the best value for money and these recent reductions on the inet broadband packages are the fruits of our labour
1692780 was not satisfied that all charges were fair and reasonable
1692781 the rio is the basic offer by batelco to other licensed operators olos that allows them to provide telecommunications services to their customers as well as connect to batelcos network so that their customers can communicate with batelcos customers
1692782 the rio outlines the wholesale rates the olos pay to batelco for terminating the services where the retail rate that the consumer pays is made up of the olos retail costs plus the wholesale charge
1692783 having reviewed the rio and having healthy debates with batelcos team tra was not satisfied that all charges were fair and reasonable
1692784 in a liberalised market where licensed operators are entitled to build their own networks it is important to get all operators customers connected therefore the availability of interconnection services is a key issue for operators in order to be able to function competitively
1692785 we hope that this reduction will be reflected on the retail charges that consumers pay and give financial incentives to all market players to invest more in telecommunications infrastructure this will support economic development and consumers will enjoy the benefits of competition and greater choice
1692786 we have received the order we are going to comply with the order and this is a work in progress between us and the tra

1692789 chris bosh will flee toronto and look at orlando and western conference teams
1692790 the political structure is ossified stuck in the controversies of the 1960s and republicans are in trouble because issues like race and abortion do not resonate as strongly with a new generation of voters
1692791 this is the clearest example in modern times of a presidency defined by one thing and one thing alone the war on terror
1692792 bushs popularity rose to 90 percent after 9 11 as people rallied around the flag but the war ground on with little progress and began to be seen as a mistake by more and more people even the economy didnt become an issue until the past six months and he continued to slide in public opinion polls
1692793 if obama continues to pull his punches and moderate his positions young voters will wonder about him
1692794 he only looks different in comparison to his competitor mccain allows him to look different no matter what
1692795 we may be entering an era where both liberals and conservatives have extra room to change their positions on issues and not worry so much about their base
1692796 both sides may be more willing to move to the center in this election with less fear of losing their base mccain started with a problem of his conservative base but obamas main challenge is to broaden the base of traditional liberal support to reach business people and the white working class the reagan democrats
1692797 dont think things are as they seem because theres a good chance they wont be
1692798 non jews living under jewish law in eretz yisrael land of israel must either be enslaved as water carriers and wood hewers or banished or exterminated
1692799 the difference between a jewish soul and souls of non jews all of them in all different levels is greater and deeper than the difference between a human soul and the soul of cattle
1692800 so much so that the world was created solely for the sake of jews
1692801 the majesty of israel and the question of the diaspora
1692802 there is no such thing as enemy civilians in war time
1692803 the law of our torah is to have mercy on our soldiers and to save them this is the real moral behind israels torah and we must not feel guilty due to foreign morals
1692804 a thousand non jewish lives are not worth a jews fingernail
1692805 is considered among the most learned sages of the torah
1692806 it is impossible to mix the pure with the impure they the arabs are a blight a devil a disaster the arabs are donkeys and we have to ask ourselves why god didnt create them to walk on all four well the answer is that they are needed to build and clean they dont have any place in our school
1692807 if they dont stop after we kill 100 then we must kill a thousand and if they dont stop after 1 000 then we must kill 10 000 if they still dont stop we must kill 100 000 even a million whatever it takes to make them stop
1692808 what is hateful to yourself dont do to your fellow human being that is the whole of the torah and the rest is commentary
1692809 how to deploy and use these kinds of substances so you start to piece it all together
1692810 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1692811 see if saddam hussein s linked in any way to this
1692812 i know i know but see if saddam was involved just look i want to know any shred
1692813 if the scientific path leads to iraq as the supporter of the anthrax used by the terrorist mailers no one should be surprised
1692814 well some connection between the saddam regime and what happened on sept 11 or the anthrax stuff something like that
1692815 by far the likeliest supplier of the anthrax is saddam hussein
1692816 the man entrusted with investigating iraqi involvement in the september 11 attacks and anthrax outbreaks
1692817 w hether americans like it or not the results of the presidential election have propelled charismatic and evangelical christians into new heights of political power
1692818 jews are gods chosen and have no need for dialogue with any gentile
1692819 were going to stay in iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there
1692820 its their governments choice if they were to say leave we would leave
1692821 said his government was impatiently waiting for the complete withdrawal of u s troops
1692822 redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
1692823 the first truly 21st century military we must maintain the strongest best equipped military in the world
1692824 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
1692825 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
1692826 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
1692827 regret what that secret operation was an excellent idea it had the effect of drawing the russians into the afghan trap and you want me to regret it the day that the soviets officially crossed the border i wrote to president carter in substance we now have the opportunity of giving to the ussr its vietnam war
1692828 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h w bush john f kennedy and ronald reagan
1692829 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place
1692830 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
1692831 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
1692832 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
1692833 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
1692834 we want to lift a loud voice to change our food system
1692835 we need to change the ways we grow distribute and eat food which needs to be good clean and fair things are at a crisis point with respect to health and the environment
1692836 we have been talking about a vegetable garden on the white house lawn this would be a way to talk about stewardship and nourishment thomas jefferson had such a garden
1692837 a big message of slow food nation is that we all need to be planting gardens
1692838 we need to have more greenhouses in the future whether it gets too hot or too cold

1692845 we intend to raise awareness about the profound effects of our food choices on the environment on our health and on issues of social justice

1692850 the clash of ideas critical thinking from incisive minds and inspiring dialog
1692851 more people are thinking about what they eat these days
1692852 im proud to be a small part of this movement with a vision for a better food system it can help activate people to work to change food policies
1692853 i went to slow food nations parent terra madre in italy
1692854 it was life changing i plan to go to slow food nation because i do not want to miss another chance for a life changing event
1692855 terra madre was a heart event it was a thrill to see families still making the food they have made for centuries you feel this human thing it was very emotional and made me cry some recipes for corn bread for example had been handed down for twenty generations

1692927 mena telecom aims to make broadband services available to customers throughout the kingdom of bahrain at better value for money prices equally using wireless technology we aim to provide customers with the convenience that will come from nomadic service availability we selected motorola because it is a leading major vendor with assets in all of the critical product and service line areas and the necessary global span and market presence needed to deliver a practical fully integrated end to end wimax solution we will be a full service provider of voice and data and motorolas wimax and ims solutions and services allow us to achieve our goal of affordable broadband for both business and individual consumers without the complexity of building a wired network

1692931 it is not going to be one of those annoying multi pop up advertisements none of that is going to be there
1692932 the quicker people sign up the quicker we will expand the network
1692933 this is a gift to bahrain we will offer attractive internet connectivity to other parts of the region but at the end of the day we are not a charity we are a business we want to make money so we cant really give it free to everybody
1692934 i would like to see all my competitors do the same and give free internet to the users

1692936 we should produce around 110 000 tonnes of nickel this year and double that in five years usmar told reuters on the side of the diggers and dealers mining conference
1692937 we believe in the long term strength of the nickel market usmar said despite the metal losing about a third of its value so far this year on the london metal exchange over concerns a global supply glut was looming
1692938 when you are looking at the supply side there is potential for disappointment from the sector as a whole because these projects generally arent are getting any cheaper and are not getting a quicker
1692939 we have been aggressive acquirers and at times there is a halo effect but the reality is we dont asset strip we have a very strong mandate

1692942 bahrains score of over 200 per cent indicates a well connected population with a high percentage of citizens enjoying access to more than one mode of communication
1692943 businesses locating in bahrain recognise the excellent ict information communications technology infrastructure as one of the many advantages that moving to the kingdom can bring
1692944 in elke mens schuilt helaas een potenti le moordenaar levensdelicten worden als beestachtig ervaren maar doorgaans doden dieren geen soortgenoten alleen mensen en sommige mensapen zijn daartoe in staat hij ontleedt zo nauwkeurig mogelijk de motieven van de moordenaars van partnerdoding tot genocide voortdurend stelt hij zich de vraag naar het waarom van hun soms zo onbegrijpelijke daden
1692945 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1692946 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1692947 freddie macs liquidity position remains strong as a result of its continued access to the debt markets at attractive spreads the companys cash and investments portfolio of approximately 70 billion dollars and an unencumbered agency mortgage related securities portfolio of approximately 470 billion dollars which could serve as collateral for additional borrowings

1692949 with the exception of goldman sachs there is no other bank in the world where the impact of the subprime crisis has been weaker
1692950 the fall in the readiness to place orders in the industrial sector seen in recent months is continuing

1692952 the support from already received orders is drying up very quickly suggesting an end to the boom days in industrial production is close at hand
1692953 likely that the euro zone will be the first major economy to fall into recession

1692967 sumados a los procesos de inflaci n nos muestra que estamos totalmente desfasados
1692968 es cierto que hay fraude y que han habido operativos pero quiero poner blanco sobre negro no hay que justificar el hurto de energ a me parece bien que se hagan operativos y que la gente que tienen capacidad de pago lo haga pero quiero aclarar que san lorenzo fue una ciudad castigada por la desocupaci n de los 90 y eso gener pr cticas o costumbres vinculadas al pago de servicios p blicos tambi n hay una negligencia compartida por parte de la empresa provincial de la energ a porque situaciones de esta naturaleza se toleraron de forma p blica durante a os tambi n hay una realidad hay un mont n de gente en estos momentos que tienen total voluntad de pago y hay mucha gente que quiere tener su medidor se dan muchas situaciones como el caso de gente que ha pagado el medidor y hace meses que no se lo colocan o la falta de inversiones por parte de la empresa entonces hagamos los operativos pero contemplemos todas las situaciones

1693021 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1693022 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1693023 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1693024 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together
1693025 the lord directs our steps so why try to understand everything along the way
1693026 i would have graded your papers but i wrote this comma guide instead

1693047 theyre laughing at the fact that you are so totally incapable of communicating verbally
1693048 you ought to go and sit over there in the corner where your ignorance wont serve to embarrass you further
1693049 the school was built 35 years ago and our garden backed on to what was the playing fields which was fine and no problem at the time then 15 years ago they made a conservation area for the children which backed on to our garden but was fenced off
1693050 that was fine a conservation area is great but over the years they planted trees and shrubs it just grew and grew and grew and it was never maintained
1693051 last year they tidied it up and it was absolutely beautiful but a year later its a mess
1693052 they promised it would be cut twice a year but it hasnt been its just been left to wrack and ruin this is the worst its been my husband used to jump over and cut it away but he cant do it now were in our 60s we just dont know where to turn
1693053 we believe the school is aware of the issue they are the managers of the school grounds so the neighbours need to speak to them directly
1693054 obviously this is difficult during the holiday period so we suggest they get in touch at the beginning of next term

1693056 when we bought the land the building was derelict and the area was overgrown so we cleared the site unaware there was a tpo
1693057 we are a reputable company with 40 years experience and this was an unfortunate error as we never received a report from our solicitor which listed if any tpos existed
1693058 the solicitor emailed it and we would normally receive a hard copy but both did not materialise
1693059 we received a letter from the council on monday and will be looking at replanting in the next season
1693060 trees are a very important part of our environment and the council expects property owners to respect them
1693061 i hope these successful prosecutions send a clear message that tpos are for real
1693062 the governments data is extremely complex and doesnt make it easy for the public to see the impact on their area the caa also confirmed many of the fears that i and others have already expressed
1693063 what they also show is that not only will maidenhead be affected by plans to expand heathrow but twyford will also suffer
1693064 both mixed mode operations which could happen as early as 2015 and a third runway will have a very serious effect on twyford the proposed arrival routes will see more planes travelling directly over twyford as they come in to land
1693065 the planes can detract from the pleasure and affect the ability to view the birds that habitat on the lake
1693066 its hard to say what impact additional aircraft could have on the species because you have to remember these birds are sometimes 5 000 feet in the air anyway so they are probably used to it
1693067 they would probably have to be really low to affect the birds
1693068 maybe you will solve all the puzzles that would be great

1693127 their sentiments appear contingent on the false assumption that black and minority cultures are intrinsically opposed to universal human rights principles and that they do not contribute to the body of law based on such principles that now inform the english legal system in doing so they allow religious and cultural contexts to become the overriding framework within which those from ethnic and religious minorities are perceived inevitably drawing on very narrow assumptions about religion and the role of women

1693144 thats all i can tell you right now he said
1693145 it might be someone who got slighted on the reps he said
1693146 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody who knows anything about the game knows that
1693147 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves

1693152 hes stronger hes quicker than hes ever been coach lane kiffin said
1693153 i sort of just stopped thinking about it and started playing scott said
1693154 things were clicking and coach millard told me i could beat these guys with a quick hitter right up the field by the way they were setting i just did the best i could
1693155 this race and this country and this life produced me he said i shall express myself as i am
1693156 i cannot think he is a supremely great poet there is something lacking in him he is very beautiful very graceful in short the perfect artist but he seldom lets us forget the artist we are never swept away not he he flows on serenely and that is good but an occasional bit of wild nature would make it better still
1693157 do you know a horrible thing has happened to me i have begun to doubt tennyson
1693158 even excluding the plays it is a vast body of work poems of feeling and of sentiment poems of thought and of received opinion when browning acquired an audience he turned garrulous tennyson turned sententious but the representative voice does not merely entertain doubts he actually feels them his politics like his religion are rooted in memory of the past and fear of the future a liberal he distrusts progressivism even as he acknowledges the injustices and evils that make it necessary tennyson is an intellectual enigma which is why many take him to be a philosopher speaking for their own indecision and doubt
1693159 i wrote as much as seventy lines at one time and used to go shouting them about the fields after dark
1693160 the real truth is that tennyson with all his temperament and artistic skill is deficient in intellectual power and no modern poet can make very much of his business unless he is pre eminently strong in this
1693161 i detest tennysons arthur if id been guinevere id have been unfaithful to him too but not for lancelot he is just as unbearable in another way as for geraint if id been enid id have bitten him these patient griseldes of women deserve all they get i like tennyson because he gives me nothing but pleasure i cannot love him because he gives me nothing but pleasure i love best the poets who hurt me but i think i shall have some love for tennyson after this for today i read a verse in in memoriam which i do not think i can ever have read carefully before which scorched me with a sudden flame of self revelation and brought to me one of those awful moments when we look into the abysses of our own natures and recoil in horror the verse was do we indeed desire the dead should still be near us at our side is there no baseness we would hide no inner vileness that we dread
1693162 it is not religious because of the quality of its faith but because of the quality of its doubt
1693163 in 1850 tennyson received public laurels and fulfilled a private desire he was married after a courtship whose length reflected not reluctance but lack of money he published
1693164 tennyson spoke to and for his age in in memoriam its success as a long poem depends on its fragmentariness the sections are elegiac idylls assembled into a sequence like maud the sequence hangs together thanks to what eliot called the greatest lyrical resourcefulness that a poet has ever shown elegies and poems of aftermath were tennysons forte he was a gray beard from the beginning
1693165 it was either a strike or a complete pass to the catcher ryan alexander a spokesman for the west michigan whitecaps recalled tuesday

1693191 weve got a lot of expertise in the country that we can sell and what id like this government to do is to develop our science and technology to then sell to other countries
1693192 i think as a nation we need to give the signal to our governments that its ok to dedicate a couple of billion dollars towards this because its going to benefit us for decades to come
1693193 and guess who has a lot of knowledge and intellectual capital to capitalise on this
1693194 australia we do we really are a clever country we punch way above our weight when it comes to scientific knowledge engineering knowledge engineering renewable energy resources and ideas and technology
1693195 we havent done that well in putting that technology into practice but we have it we have a lot of answers that we can provide dare i say sell to china and india and indonesia and malaysia and all those countries that are wanting to grow and expand and develop we can tell them how to do it perhaps more cleverly than we did it ourselves

1693459 to be honest weve been in the garden a lot because the weather has been so good this week

1693462 ive always said to my husband do kids really need to go on holiday when you think about it holiday for children means its usually playing in the pool or in the sea
1693463 so the paddling pool has been a real godsend theyve had such a good time with it and im surprised that more families have not set one up in their gardens because all the kids and their friends seem to want to do is go in the pool
1693464 since the article its been quite interesting lots of people have now said theyre not going away either the same comments have been coming up about the rising cost of petrol and food and mortgages coming to the end of fixed rates were all in the same boat
1693465 so far so good but if the weather takes a turn for the worst i will struggle and i think it will mean getting out in the car and spending more money
1693466 it used gel tablets so you can easily move it about it would be good for camping but in a garden i prefer charcoal

1693470 schwarzeneggers plan to help erase the states 17 2 billion budget deficit would raise the sales tax for three years after which the rate would dip below the current level the sources said in san francisco for example sales taxes would increase from 8 5 percent to 9 5 percent
1693471 the tax increase would require a two thirds vote in both houses of the legislature along with the governors signature before it could take effect
1693472 the increase would bring the state about 4 billion in whats left of the current fiscal year which began july 1 and as much as 6 billion in each of the next two years one source said sales tax on gasoline would be exempted from the increase the source added
1693473 and democrats have expressed concern that sales taxes fall too heavily on the poor they support higher income taxes on the wealthy and the repeal of tax breaks available to corporations
1693474 almost every republican in the legislature meanwhile has signed an oath never to support a tax increase assemblyman chuck devore r irvine predicted that schwarzeneggers proposal would win no gop votes
1693475 youre talking about raising the cost of living on working californians at precisely the time inflation is beginning to raise its ugly head devore said
1693476 in a recent letter to assembly speaker karen bass parra issues what appears to be a stark ultimatum i simply cannot support a budget without a solution to the central valleys water supply the hanford lawmaker said in a july 29 letter obtained by the bee
1693477 a vote on a budget that adequately reflects our states priorities is only half honest unless we are simultaneously addressing the issue of water supply
1693478 democratic state controller john chiang said monday it would take at least six months to reconfigure the states payroll system to issue blanket checks at the federal minimum wage of 6 55 per hour though schwarzenegger insists such a change should occur this month
1693479 experts say chiang isnt joking when he describes the states payroll system as a computing relic on par with vacuum tubes and floppy disks
1693480 its an example of a number of computer systems in which the state made a large investment decades ago and has been keeping it going the last few years with duct tape said michael cohen director of state administration with the legislative analysts office
1693481 besides chiang says the states cash situation isnt nearly as dire as schwarzenegger claims with enough money to meet its payroll and other obligations through september
1693482 schwarzeneggers action is based on faulty legal and factual premises and is just wrong chiang told a legislative hearing monday
1693483 so what happens now if schwarzenegger were to continue this bit of political theater
1693484 he would sue us and we would respond chiang says with characteristic diffidence
1693485 while schwarzeneggers stunt has received much media attention it has not propelled the legislature into quickly resolving its ideological conflicts over spending and taxes nor should it
1693486 we do need a new budget but more important we need a budget that fairly balances income and outgo not one that continues the states years long fiscal charade
1693487 if voters approve a november ballot measure banning same sex marriages in california thousands of gay and lesbian weddings conducted since the state supreme court legalized the unions on may 15 will probably remain valid attorney general jerry brown said monday
1693488 the potential effect of proposition 8 on existing same sex marriages is already being debated among legal scholars and opposing sides in the nov
1693489 the measure would amend the state constitution to declare that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
1693490 the measure does not state explicitly that it would nullify same sex marriages performed before nov 4 but in their ballot arguments supporters of prop 8 declare it would invalidate all such marriages regardless of when or where performed an interpretation that would apply to existing as well as future marriages
1693491 the state fair political practices commission also announced fines against former gov
1693492 he failed to fully disclose 187 381 in unpaid expenses and a late contribution and he did not keep some records required for donors who gave 5 000 or more the commission determined
1693493 both escutia and davis signed settlement agreements with the commissions enforcement division admitting the violations and agreeing to pay the fines 2 000 for escutia and 4 950 for davis commissioners will meet aug 14 to approve the agreements
1693494 the payments made to the political firm headed by escutias husband at the time leo briones when she was still in the legislature included one from a client who later had a matter pending before lawmakers escutia voted in 2006 to support a bill reducing fees for hospitals a onetime briones client altamed health services hired a law firm in 2006 to lobby on the bill

1693541 with over 5 million hits each month this website has revolutionised the way we buy diamonds
1693542 we understood that hits was not recognised as a measurement of website traffic by the joint industry committee for web standards in the uk jicwebs it only recognised measurements of unique users page impressions or visits
1693543 the bottom line is that the hits are misleading they are never synonymous with the number of site visitors or page views
1693544 we considered that readers were likely to understand that the claim 5 million hits was a reference to the websites popularity and that hits was a reliable measure of that popularity
1693545 we considered that some readers might go so far as to infer that each month cool diamonds had five million visitors or that five million web pages had been viewed by visitors
1693546 because the number of hits a website received was unlikely to reflect or be a reliable measure of the number of visitors to the site or pages viewed we concluded that the claim was likely to mislead readers into thinking the website was more popular than it was

1693645 each director brings something different to the stage creating suspense throughout the performance
1693646 what makes this play different from the others is that it is not the who done it murder mystery but a how and why murder mystery
1693647 of the three plays this one is the classic who done it murder mystery

1693649 what i love about this play is that it has a fantastic sense of humor that you dont usually find with agatha christie

1693674 i didnt have anything to do with the two hour television movie
1693675 i was brought in after the movie to create the series but what i found was that fans missed certain things like the turbo boost and the interaction between mike traceur played by justin bruening and the kitt voiced by val kilmer

1693683 i was making a joke earlier at the dexter tca panel but i must say that certain members of my family seem to be more comfortable with me simulating serial murder than simulating a gay relationship with a black man

1693685 certainly when i finished six feet under i didnt see dexter on the horizon and i imagine or at least hope that there are things to come that i cant conceive at this moment

1693907 gasoline prices have resulted in higher costs for almost everything and the price of our most basic necessities have skyrocketed
1693908 many of our citizens are already forced to choose between food medication or gas to get to work
1693909 i believe if this rate increase is allowed to go through many people will be cold this winter
1693910 we feel that seniors and people on assistance are going to feel the brunt of this
1693911 in addition to the distribution rate increase the company is also talking about plans for upgrading pipeline structures over the next 25 years that will add 1 12 a month to customers bills the first year and an estimated 90 cents more per month in each additional year

1693913 and if i want to make an improvement on my home i have to take money from my pension or savings to do it
1693914 but what about those who are not so resourceful i find this totally disgusting
1693915 this is not a community that earns major dollars and this increase will have a real detrimental impact on those who live here
1693916 and we encourage those on fixed incomes to look into creating a budget agreement or consider a pipp percentage of income payment plan or h e a p heating and energy assistance program
1693917 i had a lot of weed pressure and they got planted a little late but i think theyll be fine

1693922 we saved some buying fertilizers early in the year because we knew the price was going up but costs next year fertilizers chemicals fuel are expected to be even higher
1693923 whats most unusual this year is the increase in prices for diesel fuel and for fertilizers
1693924 if a farmer has to borrow on his expected crop to put a crop in then if it fails hes out the money to repay the loan
1693925 we got a lot of rain at the first of the season which worried us some but everything seems to be turning out well

1693934 senator barack obama often highlights the campaign contributions of 200 or less that have amounted to
1693935 61 600 in checks to john mccains presidential campaign and the republican national committee most of it within days of mccains decision to endorse offshore oil drilling norbizness
1693936 is mccain running a limping message free presidential campaign on a couple of issues most notably iraq that analysis is incorrect
1693937 if conservatives truly want to take immediate action on energy they can stop wasting time on

1693943 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software amp the app store

1693968 coach hiestand stresses he wants us to come out and be physical and come off the ball and get after it thats what poles has been trying to do

1693971 you get a chance to look at all of the players
1693972 but its also a big opportunity for someone like myself to step up and show what ive got there are so many veterans who arent getting reps on the line its an opportunity for me to show i can play at this level
1693973 they put me at center they put me at guard i have to show i can play both the more you know the better

1694029 the good of our soul is more important than that of our body and we have to prefer the spiritual welfare of our neighbor to our bodily comforts if a certain kind of dress constitutes a grave and proximate occasion of sin and endangers the salvation of your soul and others it is your duty to give it up o christian mothers if you knew what a future of anxieties and perils of ill guarded shame you prepare for your sons and daughters imprudently getting them accustomed to live scantily dressed and making them lose the sense of modesty you would be ashamed of yourselves and you would dread the harm you are making of yourselves the harm which you are causing these children whom heaven has entrusted to you to be brought up as christians

1694031 i am appalled that democrat lawmakers will not agree to these commonsense amendments
1694032 i just found out that they did charge casey formally today which is a good thing because look what they charged her with to me that is actually almost a victory for the home team today because they obviously have not found anything

1694034 she is a part of me and without her i feel incomplete
1694035 we bring caylee and everybody is going to know and casey is not going to be this monster that everybody has painted her out to be

1694048 i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1694049 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment in his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is

1694060 the trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of ones time defending scoundrels for it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all
1694061 the americans dont follow the rules for consul visits so well just execute this american without letting him speak to his country
1694062 pray for your enemies and forgive those who persecute you
1694063 he was born in mexico but moved to the united states as a child
1694064 why is this even a question nice liberal twist on the story though replace mexican national with illegal alien murderer
1694065 he got to live for 15 years after that crime in my opinon that is 15 years too many

1694078 i have a lifetime of experience i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he made in 2002
1694079 you mean they cant stay even if they want to stay they cant stay
1694080 i dont know if theyll get them to turn them back on but they are down there trying
1694081 and verily if they find themselves without a sense of humor they shall be dashed upon the rocks of parody and find themselves desolate may it be so
1694082 from the fact that a reprieve requires an official stamp of approval the new visual identity is all based on the look of official forms a reference to the kind of government bureaucracy that reprieve lawyers have to deal with
1694083 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1694084 and verily if they find themselves without a sense of humor they shall be dashed upon the rocks of parody and find themselves desolate may it be so
1694085 obamas transformation if you go by his campaign so far would mean higher income taxes higher social security taxes higher investment taxes higher corporate taxes massive new domestic spending and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full scale single payer system is that what most americans want someone who will fulfill a democratic policy wish list
1694086 obamas proposal would impose social security taxes on income above 250 000 per year he would continue to exempt income between 102 000 and 250 000 from social security taxes
1694087 i would roll back the bush tax cuts for those making over 250 000
1694088 sen obama wants to raise the long term capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 to around 20 percent or somewhat higher but not above the 28 percent level it reached during the reagan presidency an obama economic adviser says the same rate would apply to most dividend income for these investors

1694090 ntufs third round of costing out the candidates platforms since january 29 found that clinton would increase yearly federal spending by 289 6 billion compared to sen obamas d il 343 9 billion both significantly higher totals from the last update on march 3
1694091 as presidential campaign pace quickens candidates race ahead with bigger federal budget promises updated study shows
1694092 by our calculations using figures supplied by the campaigns sen hillary rodham clinton n y has proposed new spending and tax breaks that would amount to almost 265 billion a year when fully implemented while the initiatives proposed by sen barack obama ill total nearly 333 billion
1694093 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
1694094 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
1694095 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
1694096 green jobs and green technology will be vital to our economic future there is no reason that the u s should not be a leader in developing and deploying these new technologies
1694097 coal produces the majority of our electricity today some believe that marketing viable clean coal technologies could be over 15 years away john mccain believes that this is too long to wait and we need to commit significant federal resources to the science research and development that advance this critical technology once commercialized the u s can then export these technologies to countries like china that are committed to using their coal creating new american jobs and allowing the u s to play a greater role in the international green economy
1694098 nuclear power is a proven zero emission source of energy and it is time we recommit to advancing our use of nuclear power currently nuclear power produces 20 of our power but the u s has not started construction on a new nuclear power plant in over 30 years russia have goals of building a combined total of over 100 new plants and we should be able to do the same it is also critical that the u s be able to build the components for these plants and reactors within our country so that we are not dependent on foreign suppliers with long wait times to move forward with our nuclear plans
1694099 this reform will simplify the tax code reward activity in the u s and make us more competitive with other countries a permanent credit will provide an incentive to innovate and remove uncertainty at a time when our companies need to be more competitive we need to provide a permanent incentive to innovate and remove the uncertainty now hanging over businesses as they make r amp d investment decisions
1694100 according to the department of energy wind could provide as much as one fifth of electricity by 2030 the u s solar energy industry continued its double digit annual growth rate in 2006 to develop these and other sources of renewable energy will require that we rationalize the current patchwork of temporary tax credits that provide commercial feasibility john mccain believes in an even handed system of tax credits that will remain in place until the market transforms sufficiently to the point where renewable energy no longer merits the taxpayers dollars

1694370 i feel sorry for the guy but i felt sorry too for the albanians who suffered under milosevic
1694371 the way the health system pays the workers in it it has a very strong bias in favor of high tech services highly specialized services and primarily services for acute care
1694372 in the latest version of the islamic penal codes bill which has undergone several modifications such punishments are not mentioned jamshidi said the reformist
1694373 deeply concerned over the fate of the nine but it was not known if they were among those whose lives have been spared
1694374 the implementation of stoning has been suspended for several people who have received this sentence jamshidi said without giving a number
1694375 two of them have been pardoned by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and then sentenced to about 10 years in jail he said
1694376 and the verdict for two others has been changed to lashes he said adding that other cases were under discussion by the judiciarys clemency commission

1694382 ahora debemos depender de la corte suprema de estados unidos para evitar que texas viole un compromiso adoptado por el presidente y el senado en nombre del pa s en general lament
1694383 we are delighted by todays unanimous jury decision in favour of the atp
1694384 fundamental right to set and make changes to the atp tour calendar changes that are necessary if we are to unlock the full potential of our sport
1694385 the player is here and will remain with the team he will start thursdays game against ivory coast in shanghai from the beginning and im sure he can be with us for the rest of the competition
1694386 not at this time no i have spoken with him and he wants to stay here with the rest of the team
1694387 i hope this decision will not have any effects on other teams with players who are coming to this tournament every coach would want messi in their team hopefully barcelona can take the decision that he stays here
1694388 surprised and disappointed by the cas decision but we respect it
1694389 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympics it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1694390 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1694391 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1694392 we are pleased with the cas decision because we have worked closely with the clubs in this legal matter
1694393 it was always our opinion that under fifa regulations we were not committed to allowing our players to go freely fifa failed to realise the legal implications of this decision early and the preparation of the clubs ahead of the new season has been affected
1694394 it is sad for the athletes concerned they were dreaming of the games but obviously there are some issues between the players and the clubs
1694395 hemos decidido suspender el viaje a tarija porque el imperio norteamericano ataca desde aqu se alo al amo a pocos d as del refer ndum democr tico de bolivia pareciera que hay desespero imperial

1694397 we cannot be fooled by a government that is pushing through a contraband reform
1694398 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
1694399 refrain from being influenced by the putschist attitudes of opposition groups
1694400 the president is publishing these laws while the opposition is going through the complicated process of unity
1694401 the only way to combat ch vez is by winning spaces of power without losing hope

1694412 evidentemente mi hija fue internada por haber ingerido pastillas con alcohol lo que sinceramente es para m una situaci n dif cil de platicar sin embargo lo hago porque no tuve esa oportunidad antes debido a mi admisi n en un centro a fin de evitar recaer en las adicciones
1694413 creanme para mi esto es una situaci n sumamente dif cil de platicar porque amo a mi hija y me duele haberla visto sufriendo y porque no hay mayor dolor para una madre que ver a su hija sufriendo
1694414 aunque hablamos con mucha profundidad esta situaci n es evidente que para mi hija yo he sido su amiga pero ella lo que siempre ha necesitado es una madre que hasta ahora le habia hecho mucha falta pero estoy con ella aunque he tenido mis errores que me han costado bastante caros
1694415 esto le ense a ella aprender de sus errores no a victimizarse por ello yo le ense ar la paciencia y sabidur a que he aprendido porque ahora m s que nunca tiene ganas de salir adelante
1694416 evidence from the affected sectors suggests that the cost could be to the tune of 400m this will have a dramatic impact on the supply of staff to work with some of the most vulnerable in society
1694417 e mail has made it easier than ever to keep in constant contact with the office so it is hard to get a true break from work employers should not expect employees to contact the office while on holiday and instead should make provisions for their absence
1694418 the reputational damage for large corporate bodies could be substantial
1694419 the new regime is far more rigorous than the system it replaces
1694420 for example if migrant workers are absent from work for certain periods the employer must report that to the ukba

1694433 i heard the police sirens yesterday but its safe today
1694434 there are all kinds of people walking along that street
1694435 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
1694436 a leader of etim once said that the beijing olympics are their last chance for a big terror attack and that they must do it even though they are obviously an egg pitted against a stone
1694437 is china winning the hearts and minds of uighur people
1694438 there are a lot of vengeance attacks against police or government officials or imams seen as collaborators
1694439 i wouldnt be surprised if one of these guys has a personal connection with the police

1694457 when i grew up i tried to ask but there werent really answers
1694458 during my theological studies at university it became clear that i couldnt be a minister in the church
1694459 i concluded that christianity was paganism one of its most important dogmas is that god became man and if god becomes man then man also can become god
1694460 well you see he is a father of course but ideologically there was no connection i was so involved in my conviction that i had found the right path all the other items no longer had any importance
1694461 for him that was the end of the world my son is leaving germany to study in a jewish rabbinical seminary he told me i was crazy and renounced me as a son
1694462 people there dont get married and if they do they have one child
1694463 but the turks and the other foreigners have many children so it is a question of time that germany will no longer be german
1694464 germany will leave the stage of history no doubt about it
1694465 all the great cultures have left the stage of history
1694466 the romans the greeks the egyptians the babylonians but this little people who gave so much to the world do not
1694467 the motive of the converts is to join the community of the victims if you become part of the victim community you get rid of the burden of being part of the perpetrator community
1694468 shear yashuv represents a person who ran away from the past
1694469 there were no jews in these stories and no nazis in these stories
1694470 no no there were no nazis we are not nazis we didnt know any jews we didnt know anything
1694471 people said now we have closed the circle now everything is fine
1694472 it was like nothing had happened but there were 11 000 jews in munich before the holocaust where are they now
1694473 because i was annoyed by how the narrative was fixed
1694474 there is something not right when you do it to get rid of your german burden
1694475 that is not honest in my eyes do you stop being the daughter of a wehrmacht soldier if you are jewish no that is no solution you dont get rid of it
1694476 to live here to work here to be this bridge between two worlds
1694477 that is another way of saying what i have already told you
1694478 they want to join the community of the victim they may have their own way of rationalising it
1694479 i was always looking for my place i hated catholicism i have hated it since i was 14
1694480 what counts is the deed in christianity it is enough just to believe
1694481 i didnt think of my family of being like the germans
1694482 you went in the classroom twice a week they told you you fell asleep
1694483 she was 13 she says she remembered there were jewish shops that got burned down and it was a big loss because she said you could always go to the jews and buy something and if you didnt have the money you could bring it in next time
1694484 i feel myself turning into a block of ice every time when i go back i have to force myself to melt down again
1694485 but it is not the way to work through the role of the parents in the war i think it is running away from it in order to be able to really work through the past you have to try to understand how could it be that your father was a mass murderer you have to think of the possibilities that had you lived at this time you might also have been able to do such things
1694486 being in israel is to keep away as far as possible from it
1694487 i am not sure to what extent they have really been accepted into israeli society i think they are struggling i dont envy them
1694488 you are not here to speak to me you are here to speak to my girlfriend
1694489 i met some who surprised me some of them were shockingly unintelligent i even wondered why they would have the intellectual independence to make this choice especially the people who chose to be ultra orthodox who chose to throw away their freedom
1694490 i was worried i would get hurt by information i didnt want to know
1694491 sometimes i feel that a lot of israelis live that way it is better not to ask questions and not be hurt and so you dont have to look at yourself or your family or your nation and you can live with the illusion of who is good and who is bad
1694492 i heard a boy next door call another boy a stupid jew
1694493 i asked my mother what is a jew and is it something bad
1694494 i was physically disgusted and i was totally disgusted by even my own germanness
1694495 and because this entered my mind so early it became as natural as brushing my teeth
1694496 i felt that i was being told that to be a good jew you had to hate arabs
1694497 it causes a lot of tension to come here and say the things that i say
1694498 because it would be very inconsistent to have had so much criticism of germans who were terrible cowards when it was still possible to say something and then to come here and not speak up for justice
1694499 dont think i havent thought about it in those terms myself
1694500 i had wanted to connect myself to a history i did not perceive as shameful now i am wondering if i will stay i am more or less sure that i wont sometimes i feel i am not built for it that i am not strong enough for this country
1694501 sometimes i feel that just by existing i am always wrong here but i cannot live with personal attacks now i cannot bear it
1694502 on the condition that you do not print my name
1694503 hans married my grandmother erna after she divorced my grandfather
1694504 i have neither any blood nor dna from adolf and his family
1694505 but i always appreciated that she told me the truth about it we spoke frankly i never heard that normal german lie you hear so often from that generation
1694506 she became one of those german ladies who cleared up after all the bombing
1694507 that is all that my mother brought home from the war i keep them to honour her
1694508 i saw my father very seldom and the times i saw him i was so proud to have a father that it was not the time to ask what he did in the war he died when i was 19 so i never asked him what he did
1694509 it was not a sudden light from heaven that came down
1694510 how could people be so stupid as to elect a person who was writing things like this its awful
1694511 i dont think you can really understand how awful it is if you dont read it in german i put it away but i keep it here
1694512 you raise up an army if you think you have to use it
1694513 i felt at home i was no longer living in a conflict i didnt have to reject the older generation and i thought i had met for the first time a nationality that at that point in history today it is more problematic still had good reasons to be proud of itself
1694514 the sharp distinction between the generations that committed the crimes and the generation born after wouldnt exist
1694515 when i hear my own son speak as i did last weekend i sat like this
1694516 two of my sons are chauvinists and one of them is even partially racist i cant listen to fascistic discourse i dont suffer that
1694517 each time i hear it is another time too much if the holocaust and the third reich have really somehow shaped me i am a sworn democrat i believe that democracy has to prove itself by keeping the rights of its minorities
1694518 i see that soldier trampling that child and in the end killing it and i remember that kind of aggression i remember the feeling of the child too i remember both i could see my father or my grandfather really standing there
1694519 is that since i came to israel that feeling isnt there any more

1694522 measuring the value people bring to a business can be tricky but is vital to monitoring the health of your organisation hr plays a crucial role in making the links between things such as employee engagement turnover and vacancy rates and customer satisfaction and measuring their impact
1694523 there is no economic justification for these changes because balpa is one of the most successful and financially robust trade unions in the uk
1694524 no employer let alone a trade union should impose changes to terms and conditions of employment without the agreement of its staff

1694531 is meaningful health care or any other kind of reform possible
1694532 in a policy making environment that is so clearly and openly influenced by money
1694533 congress will be able to achieve health care reforms that are in the public interest
1694534 an average of about 832 000 for each senator and representative
1694535 of course theres nothing new here for decades the health care industry has leveraged its money and influence shaping policy to its own ends
1694536 there is broad expert consensus that one third to one half of all health care expenditure is waste
1694537 talk privately with most health care professionals physicians hospital execs health plan administrators benefits managers supply chain execs and there is reasonable agreement
1694538 such changes could drive tremendous savings for individual corporate and governmental purchasers
1694539 but at significant cost to health care firms and professionals revenues and profitability would plummet
1694540 what will it take for congress to mount serious public interest efforts that focus on serious issues
1694541 as far as i can tell there are two and only two solutions here
1694542 americas largest corporations the organizations that drive national policy through lobbying now to galvanize to preserve the common interest whats needed is a national business coalition that collaboratively focuses on whats good public policy for the country whats in our common short and long term interest this is tough
1694543 it would require a new congress under new leadership to resolve to rid itself of its lobbying cancer and to do so in a way that is highly visible and publicized there would be ferocious opposition from industry hence the need for visible articulate leadership from key political and business leaders
1694544 the most amazing turn of events i have seen in 20 years of following health care policy in washington dc
1694545 with colonel lawrence mercy is a passion with me it is merely good manners ill leave it to you to judge which is the more reliable
1694546 congress will stand up against big insurance and big phrma
1694547 the difference between this years and last years survey results are well within the possible sampling error
1694548 currently there are no objective measures of how accurate and reliable online information actually is however it seems that the internet is positively contributing to the quality of health care
1694549 we will need to create new forms of organization that are more flexible more adaptive and more agile than ever before
1694550 my aim as chief executive has been to unleash the creativity and productive potential of every individual and to provide an environment that encourages teamwork

1694573 this isnt exactly what i pictured of when i thought of medical school
1694574 the surgeons develop an increased efficiency less errors more fluid movement basically theyre just better
1694575 we can always tell the surgeons who are gamers because theyre naturally better
1694576 but what were finding with the wii is that the surgeons that use it regularly are achieving results that far outstrip those who have just gamed before and thats because the wii is very different
1694577 the whole point about surgery is to execute small finely controlled movements with your hands
1694578 then we saw people using the wii and noticed the precision of some movements looked very similar
1694579 you dont gain a lot from swinging an imaginary tennis racket
1694580 a laparoscope is inserted into the abdomen through small incisions theres a camera in the probe and surgeons work off monitors very small instruments are used and they are controlled by the smallest of hand movements
1694581 during minimally invasive surgeries there is reduced exposure of vital organs meaning a reduced risk of infection there is also reduced blood loss meaning reduced need for transfusions and patients can get out of hospital and back home sooner
1694582 in the countries i work in where risk of infection is high and supply of blood and beds is short any cheap development that can lead to fewer open procedures is incredibly exciting
1694583 but what makes it exciting are minds like dr kahol and smiths who look at everyday inexpensive technologies and think how could i use that
1694584 well i know i should really buy one for home but i still keep holding out hope that the hospital might give me one for research

1694589 nancy pelosi has banned cameras from the house chambers in an effort to muzzle republicans who simply want an up or down vote on oil drilling and baron hill is now copying her in banning the cameras of average hoosiers from his events
1694590 baron hill is running away from his record he has voted four times against drilling in alaska roll calls 317 and 320 in 2001 and roll calls 135 and 145 in 2003
1694591 while hoosiers are suffering from higher gas prices baron hill voted twice for congress to adjourn and take a five week paid vacation just so that he and other house liberals could avoid having to vote on expanding oil drilling roll calls 537 and 566
1694592 baron hill has voted repeatedly against expanding oil drilling and has voted for higher taxes on energy baron has endorsed barack obama a candidate whose plan to address high gas prices is to raise taxes increase regulation and have americans check the air pressure in their tires
1694593 hoosiers have questions and baron hill has a lot to answer for he should be willing to answer these questions in an open forum without any restrictions

1694609 the arminian holds that christ when he died did not die with an intent to save any particular person and they teach that christs death does not secure beyond doubt the salvation of any one man living they believe that christ died to make the salvation of all men possible or that by the doing of something else any man who pleases may attain unto eternal life consequently they are obliged to hold that if mans will would not give way and voluntarily surrender to grace then christs atonement would be unavailing they hold that there was no particularity and speciality in the death of christ christ died according to them as much for judas in hell as for peter who mounted to heaven they believe that for those who are consigned to eternal fire there was as true and real a redemption made as for those who now stand before the throne of the most high

1694773 legal frames especially in the united states are broad enough to encourage not only individual freedom but also certain individual crimes the culprit can go unpunished or obtain undeserved leniency with the support of legions of public defenders when a government starts an earnest fight against terrorism public opinion immediately accuses it of violating the terrorists civil rights there are many such cases
1694774 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space soceity appears to have litle defense against the abyss of human decadence such as misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror such a tilt of freedom in the directionof evil has come about gradually but it was evidently born out of a humanistic concept according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature
1694775 the press too enjoys the widest freedom but what use does it make of this freedom the press has become the greatest power within the western countries more powerful than the legislature the executive and the judiciary one would then like to ask by what law has it been elected and to whom is it responsible how many hasty immature superficial and misleading judgments are expressed every day confusing readers and without any verification thus we see terrorists made into heroes or secret matters pertaining to the national defense publicly revealed or shameful intrusion into the privacy of people under the false slogan everyone has the right to know everything

1694812 you can put the ip in but once you click the search button or hit enter the url defaults to www google com not the ip along with the search string not happening for you tedster
1694813 are you logged in to google havent tried it while logged in
1694814 ok youre right the search results come back on a google com url and that url is on an ip address with a different c block
1694815 no im not logged in i had actually thought the same thing possibly maybe it had to do with my google account but nope no matter what it reverts to www google com no matter what ip i do the search on once i click either the search button or i click enter it reverts to www google com and the ip on the cache links are completely different than the ip i even start with now the question is why is google doing this gt to me this would definitely mean the end of dc watching

1694958 i saw sen obamas latest attack has to do with oil and campaign contributions

1694970 our countries are neighbors condemned to live alongside each other they are separated however more by social economic and psychic differences than by physical frontiers
1694971 the really fundamental difference is an invisible one and in addition it is probably insuperable to prove that it has nothing to do with economics or political power we have only to imagine a mexico suddenly turned into a prosperous mighty country a superpower like the united states far from disappearing the differences would become more acute and clear cut

1695019 climate change is a reality that is affecting real lives information education and resources need to be dispersed to the vulnerable laymen so that they can prepare themselves for its effects
1695020 it is the duty of individuals governments and authorities to invest more in research that can help alleviate this and shed more light on this matter
1695021 many people from rural civilisations as well as agricultural production in africa rely mainly on rainfall for water supply
1695022 they are very vulnerable to fluctuations in precipitation levels and distribution
1695023 agricultural production and food security including access to food in many african countries and regions are likely to be severely affected by climate change and climate variability
1695024 the highest risk of future climate change damage is associated with specialised crop and livestock farming particularly under dry land conditions in arid and semi arid regions
1695025 this essentially requires mainstreaming climate sensitivity as an integral component of all agricultural and broader economic development planning and policy design

1695036 we are pleased to say we havent seen any downturn in any of our divisions to date
1695037 on the contrary this has in fact been our best year yet the games and digital sectors are still going through considerable growth so we expect to be busy for some time to come
1695038 the overall games market is extremely buoyant with particularly strong demand for experienced online and marketing staff in addition we are seeing good growth from a number of smaller companies which while young have very experienced management at specialmove we are still seeing great demand for our clients

1695040 the response from consumers and retailers alike has been great and interest is very high
1695041 we hope to gain traction in the market with these products in the run up to christmas and we already have other products in development that will also be released and will continue the retro theme
1695042 we think the market for retro games is growing and has been strengthened by the support for classics on wii playstation 3 and xbox 360 digital platforms

1695246 in january 2005 rakan hassan 12 was shot and paralyzed and his parents were killed when their car was riddled with gunfire by a us army patrol in iraq rakan was brought to boston through the efforts of humanitarians determined that he receive medical care now with the news that rakan was killed by a bomb planted at his home in mosul rakans time in boston seems more precious more fleeting more tragic for what could have been

1695280 when forbes reports on it the credibility that they bring is obviously significant that adds a lot of credibility for toronto from an international perspective
1695281 toronto is still the economic heart of one of the worlds wealthiest countries and its projected to keep humming through 2020
1695282 corporations and even individuals have to weigh the size of a citys economy compared to how it will be in the future and consider the potential growth in the intervening years
1695283 for that matter they have to judge whether its worth it to settle for a city that has high growth prospects but turns out to be a lousy place to live
1695284 in terms of getting companies to come here and now to stay here thats obviously really important and i think thats what has factored into their decision to include toronto with some pretty prestigious cities
1695285 when major corporations are looking to locate weve got to ensure that toronto is a place that they consider

1695293 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1695294 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1695295 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1695296 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

1695324 the european commission is very concerned by the situation in mauritania which puts into question the remarkable democratic progress in this country
1695325 this situation could put into question our policy of cooperation with mauritania
1695326 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1695327 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1695328 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1695329 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1695330 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1695331 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

1695333 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1695334 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1695335 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1695336 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1695337 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1695338 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1695339 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1695340 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1695341 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1695342 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1695343 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1695344 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1695345 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1695346 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1695347 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1695348 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1695349 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1695350 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1695351 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1695352 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1695353 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1695354 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1695355 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1695356 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1695357 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1695358 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1695359 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1695360 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1695361 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve

1695374 i think the government has the moral obligation to draw up regulations so that councils only do business with companies that dispose of electronic goods properly preferably in the netherlands or put them on the second hand market
1695375 it is the dutch association of metal and electronic products which monitors the recycling of electronic goods the association also manages the fund which the removal charge is paid into if councils brought all their old appliances to association there would not be a problem
1695376 i know it is difficult because there are all kinds of trade rules which make it difficult to limit these kind of exports and there is free trading of goods and services in europe so we have to find a legal technicality to keep this material in the netherlands but personally i would have absolutely no problem with it being done this way

1695383 china can never do it right there is a very real danger that people will couple the very visible security presence to china but i spoke to other people yesterday and security was just as tight in atlanta it is not specifically chinese
1695384 what can be learned from a simple table bayesian inference and sensitivity analysis for causal effects from 2x2 and 2x2xk tables in the presence of unmeasured confounding
1695385 in arizona the only way to get around the state is by small private plane
1695386 may i may i say may i say to you is there anybody is thats tired of paying four dollars a bucks four dollars a gallon for gasoline is there anybody thats sick and tired of it is there anybody that wants to become energy independent well im telling you right now were sending 7 million every year and your congress just went on vacation for five weeks tell em to come back and get to work tell em to get to work
1695387 when im president of the united states im not gonna let em go on vacation theyre gonna theyre gonna become energy independent and were not gonna pay four dollars a gallon for gas because were gonna drill offshore and were gonna drill now and were gonna drill here and were gonna drill now my opponent doesnt wanna drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1695388 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1695389 my friends we need a commander in chief we need a commander in chief who will end the war in iraq but will win it the right way and thats by winning it and were not gonna be defeated and my opponent my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again and we wont go back thank you thank you
1695390 second the assignment is known to both the researchers and the subjects together this opens the threat that the effect isnt about the probability itself but about the kind of drugs that are involved in high or low probability trials
1695391 the effect isnt about the probability itself but about the kind of drugs that are involved in high or low probability trials
1695392 theres got to be a better way to organize this
1695393 i was playing around with data on this website and found out that
1695394 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1695395 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1695396 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1695397 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1695398 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1695399 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1695400 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1695401 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1695402 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1695403 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1695404 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1695405 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1695406 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1695407 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1695408 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1695409 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1695410 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1695411 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1695412 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1695413 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1695414 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1695415 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1695416 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1695417 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1695418 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1695419 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1695420 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate

1695423 s f leaders go on binge to legislate good health
1695424 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1695425 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1695426 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1695427 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1695428 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1695429 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1695430 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1695431 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1695432 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1695433 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1695434 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1695435 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1695436 who are open to doing something on the production side
1695437 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1695438 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1695439 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1695440 you know where the 100 came from me people already dislike politicians enough why give them another reason
1695441 hey its the pizza hut and the party store stimulus act
1695442 the point is very simple the state would collect only what it needs to provide essential services and to protect itself in a downturn
1695443 it is becoming increasingly important for organisations to be able to manage their device fleet in a cost effective and time efficient way

1695449 a significant step in the development of santanders uk business
1695450 im sure that alliance amp leicester shareholders feel aggrieved at only receiving 317p per share given the shares peaked at 1 248p in 2006
1695451 this means that the bank is being valued at around one times its tangible book which is a very attractive price for santander given the prospect of cost savings and funding synergies for the group
1695452 a counter bid is not out of the question but no one can realistically match the firepower of santander given that they plan to add 1 billion of capital for provisioning restructuring and maintenance of a core equity tier one ratio of six per cent
1695453 lloyds seem the most likely counter bidder as they would have the potential for similar synergies and they have shown appetite for moving into a more expansionary phase
1695454 following santanders initial bid of 299p per share for a amp l customers seemed to be reaping the benefits as a amp ls share price leapt 53 per cent to 335p per share there is lingering uncertainty over a amp ls balance sheet and the uk housing market generally
1695455 while city types may be breathing a sigh of relief at the creation of a new powerhouse in uk banking the proposed deal may not be such good news for consumers
1695456 abbey and alliance amp leicester have similar structures making a merger desirable but they have both been key players in driving competition
1695457 a amp l in particular has long been regarded as the terrier of the financial services industry proving a real threat to the established big four by offering market leading current accounts and very attractive savings options this news also increases the likelihood of other smaller innovators being swallowed up by big institutions potentially damaging competition further
1695458 for example bank of scotland customers arent complaining that their bank offers the same 10 per cent aer on its regular saver account as halifax customers
1695459 both abbey and alliance amp leicester have product strengths and weaknesses but the merging of their product portfolio should make for a very strong all rounder
1695460 we look forward to seeing how the takeover affects the overall product range as it would be a shame if santander dilutes what has been a very competitive approach over the past few years from both abbey and alliance amp leicester
1695461 until we have the vote and it is passed it is business as usual there is a reason why santander are doing what they are doing and we would expect to be a part of that process everything is normal we are carrying on as normal and are still planning for 2009
1695462 where do you come from and are you telephoning your mum every week
1695463 ah kum from uddersfield and ah caal mi mum aivry soondaay

1695469 im really enjoying here i find what i am by putting myself in a different environment from where i used to be its important to get in different places because you can hardly see yourself by always being in the same place if you are a white bird you cant see yourself clearly among white birds but if you put yourself among black birds you can
1695470 to come behind a 1 record and have a person whos currently relevant in dream one of the better songwriters to come through this industry and then do the jamie foxx thing the boss of all bosses i wanted to try something differently than i did on my last album j holiday
1695471 i wanted to load up two big features on that record as well try something different a lot of times you get a feature and its just you and that other artist i wanted to see if i could bring something different to the game see if i can force people to follow my trend

1695483 i think that the challenge is tough but i always put up a good fight and if i dont win thats ok im new at this game i might win in the future
1695484 it wasnt as though we had lost our entire collection but those photos were irreplaceable
1695485 luckily we were able to find a software program that recovered most of the pictures from the card otherwise jack may still be sleeping on the couch
1695486 were always taking photos every trip to the park every event and every holiday my camera stays in my purse
1695487 i guess i thought that as long as the photos were somewhere they were safe organizing them seemed too overwhelming i didnt know where to start and i didnt have the time losing the maine vacation photos with my parents was really the wakeup call i needed to take action
1695488 this was the most time consuming task but i started with the most recent photos and worked my way back a little at the time and i actually enjoyed seeing some of the photos id forgotten about
1695489 the one thing ive learned is that you have to have multiple copies of your photos my digital photo collection is still relatively small by todays standards so all the files fit on one dvd i made two copies i took one to work and gave the other to jacks mom for safe keeping i plan on doing this after every event or holiday since it only takes a few minutes
1695490 after my photos were organized and copied i started to do simple edits nothing fancy just cropping and color correction using picasa someday when i find the time i want to buy software that lets me do more creative tasks like digital scrapbooking but thats further down the road
1695491 well do as you ask because you pay the bills yet for the record we dont believe this is going to work

1695496 i asked barack what he wanted for his birthday and he said just three things indiana colorado and virginia
1695497 john mccain is looking for someone for vice president who has more economic expertise than he does so congratulations to all of you youre on the short list
1695498 her own exhortation to her supporters plus the sense of urgency about doing everything we can to help barack obama become the next president of the united states has motivated an awful lot of us
1695499 we all wanted to make a dramatic statement that were with him every step of the way
1695500 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people
1695501 what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1695502 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
1695503 theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1695504 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign
1695505 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist
1695506 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it

1695509 its a lot of fun the material is very dynamic and we cant wait to present it to the world its been a great journey
1695510 connecting with them onstage was the first phase of the journey and then being able to create with them has been a great experience
1695511 it was the best school of song arranging in metal and rock you can ever imagine it was a wonderful experience theres nothing like it
1695512 in the studio and no offense towards jason but rob has already contributed more to this record than jason did in 14 years
1695513 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for jason but rob hes been with us five years now and its completely effortless its never felt this complete
1695514 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well
1695515 a lot of it did have to do with our fear of losing some kind of control no doubt about that
1695516 but rob has slipped in somehow easier he has this respect about him we didnt have to haze the fan out of him or toughen him up somehow
1695517 he is very gifted very fast and he kind of just fits in hes such a gifted musician and rob spent a lot of time being the third wheel in the lars james songwriting process and he just adapted to it super quickly and was great to bounce ideas off of and to come up with a great suggestion when me or james would get stuck he was right in there with us its been incredibly positive to have him around in the creative process the way we all connect with each other and the way we connect with our fans

1695521 anyone remember this case really odd probably one the strangest dissapperances linda and john were supposed to go on some trip and ended up and europe and never were heard or seen again
1695522 i remember this case they found a body buried in the backyard many years later didnt they and didnt they say it was probably john its been a while but i remember this case
1695523 some of the couples relatives received strange postcards from linda and john saying that are bad at geograpy and they some how ended up in france there is also a man forgot his name that is a suspect he supposedly sold john sohass pick up truck after the disappearance i wonder if this missing persons case is closed or open i hope its open because just because this happened almost 20 years ago doesnt mean that it shouldnt be solved dont you agree
1695524 i asked the same question under the post of christopher chichester christopher chichester is a pseudonym for christian gerhard streider a german citizen who is considered a suspect in the disappearance of john and linda sohos
1695525 shortly after linda married this sohus guy things went south linda mayfield sohus quit her bookstore job soon she and her husband disappeared the bookstore owner lydia marano got a postcard from linda amp john saying that they were in france they never returned
1695526 johns alcoholic mother didi had claimed that john and lindas former tenant christopher chichester was providing her with exclusive information that john and linda were on a top secret
1695527 there are similarities between clark rockefellers description and the description of chichester
1695528 the resemblance is certainly there and that is going to be folded into the investigation

1695530 from the time of the abduction to today special agents from the fbi as well as boston police detectives have worked around the clock trying to figure out who rockefeller is
1695531 its been roughly nine days since they started this process and before 1993 we are no closer to knowing who this defendant is he has used various aliases
1695532 i would not allow him to talk to the police whether he is innocent or guilty any lawyer would not allow his client to talk to police
1695533 weve had 18 practices so far and they mean a lot but the games mean a lot too

1695535 i think just getting a little bit of work like today starting to move forward is going to be a big plus for me
1695536 if bills going to out me in there ill play but one practice usually isnt enough for bill
1695537 weve told everyone to be ready to go and they will be
1695538 i dont think its been that different than its been the past couple years

1695585 the growth of the internet as an advertising medium is taking business way from direct marketing classified and local and regional press but doesnt appear to be taking away from television what matters is that we outgrow the growth in internet advertising in the first half of this year the internet grew as an advertising medium by 24 percent and we grew at 43 percent so were growing at nearly double the rate

1695649 my dad david is a councillor and leader of westhoughton town council
1695650 hes going to be mayor and because my mum prefers to keep behind the scenes dad asked me to be his mayoress
1695651 initially they said where because theyd never even heard of westhoughton and they thought id be swanning round in a polyester trouser suit because traditionally mayoresses tend to be older
1695652 but once i told them what id got planned for my year of office they were all pretty impressed so much so they are pushing for an invite to the official ceremony ive definitely put westhoughton on the map
1695653 im in the process of organising an open air concert in westhoughtons central park in august im hoping it will be a success id love to encourage younger people to support community events
1695654 and if i can introduce some new ones to sit alongside the more traditional then it can only be a good thing
1695655 of course at my age i love to go out and have a good time
1695656 but i dont think it would be fitting for someone to see their mayoress drunk and falling about all over the place
1695657 i dont really drink that much but i will still keep my role in mind when im out with my friends

1695680 yes blimp is like his mother both full of brains and both liked to spend on pleasurables whereas patsie is a mix she is too sensible and too untidy to be quite like me but she is not a bit like her mother in fact when mother was dying she practically shovelled her in with her worrying about her soul
1695681 where was i oh the package the package which was brought here by loafin well almost brought here by him thanks once again for bringing it let me tell you about a very good friend of mine his name was aodghan he was an excellent chap at remembering all the stuff we used when we went sailing and remembering all the things we had to do in fact he was the most meticulous fellow i have ever known the most extraordinary thing which i only found out only after his death and which i still dont understand with him being so fussy and she being so fat was that he and my wife were having it off for many years there you are
1695682 aodghan was all right though he spread a little happiness into her life i guess and he was a contributor to my package story let me go and get the package i left it in the kitchen
1695683 ah you are looking at the photo do you know that that photo was taken in mr ryans la fotografa studio in the green it used to be upstairs above the toy shop near the corner of grafton street i am sure that is where the aunts and uncles bought those airships mr ryan was a great traveller with many a story one day he told us he was on the train from krusavach to pirot in serbia back in the thirties but we are not talking about his stories however good they are we are talking about the package
1695684 i found the package alright it was in the kitchen i had put it away in my absent minded way in the grocery cupboard but i have it
1695685 that pack has had a long journey even the distance it has travelled in the last six months
1695686 it was in the possession of most exuberant of italians except that he was a third generation american from morocco but you would have thought he had a neapolitan flair to him he came here and greeted me with kisses and long speeches in rapid american which even though i understood very little of what he said i did enjoy he told me about his accidental discovery of it in a house in new hampshire and i was able to put it right about who owned it me
1695687 the story of how it got here is a tale in itself i go on a visit to my sister annually who is married to a dubliner who has made good in new york making money out of money he has a large spread near santa monica where he likes to mix his clientele with the stars for a month each year he charges the clients big bucks for the privilege i love to be there and invite a few of my friends who take up saleable space and that really gets to him but he must be polite to the oldest in law
1695688 well i was there last year and who should show up as one of his clients but bernardo the moroccan american he told me that he had acquired the package and that he had confirmed it was the goods we did a deal for the costs to him which were quite small as the woman who had it in winchester new hampshire had inherited it from a second cousin in colorado springs so i got it for a couple of thousands after the sojourn in california he went home and found that his daughter you know how they are had taken it along with a few other bric a brac which included a tiny picture attributable to someone in the 1500s he had some adventure getting the two items back the daughter who was only 14 and knew no better was dispatched to find out who had bought them this she did and papa and she went to visit first of all the man who had acquired the picture and he was a charmer he said i knew all about this picture it is a tiny masterpiece which was executed for the grandees mistress by her lover i know also that it was not meant to be sold for i know you and you are man of considerable discernment give me the twenty dollars i paid for it and leave it to your delightful daughter when you go to meet your maker then they went to see the woman who bought the package as part of mixed lot of rubbish at the end of the sale they were shown into her regency style withdrawing room furnished with those white and delicate pieces and two gynormous white sofas she held court here they asked for the package back and after an hour and a half of wrangling in the politest fashion they succeeded in buying it back for twice what she had paid the charity for the whole box of tricks sixty dollars
1695689 bernardo decided he had better send it immediately fast post guaranteed delivery and swiftest way to send it he had a credit manager sean who was going to collect or at least have a talk with an english debtor so he entrusted it to him and got him to promise not to let his eyes leave it until it was in my possession and to enjoy his folks in mayo after delivery so sean kept it on his person at all times through jfk on the flight through heathrow to the debtor in isleworth from whom he collected the sum of 437 265 and odd pennies into the bank and transferred the dosh back to terminal 3 and collapsed he had eaten the wrong kind of mushroom he had gotten sick many times in the ambulance and having emptied his wallet everything was put away sean was nauseous and a bit befogged when bernardo came to empathise empathise he did but on enquiry about the package sean could not remember
1695690 bernardo was very good he spent three days looking and he found it in locker beside seans bed as bimbo was coming over here to check his bank balance i asked him to collect the package which he did and he passed it on to loafin and thanks very much for finding it i am most grateful could i give you some reward for finding it and bringing it back
1695691 you know that is a lot of losing i am tired and must go to bed
1695692 must do something about the package now i have it tell you what why dont you come back next tuesday morning no let us meet at the dawson street club and i will buy you lunch you are a good listener must get to know more about you good night
1695693 looking at my face is like reading in the car its alright for ten minutes then you start to feel sick

1695709 we will obviously take a very keen interest in what the imc has to report
1695710 for policing and justice devolution to occur there has to be sufficient confidence in the unionist community and one of those elements is removing the ira from the stage
1695711 this isnt the only factor there will be others that we need to take into account as well like the structures being put in place for the devolution of policing and justice
1695712 i have no confidence that an answer other than that suiting the governments will be produced and that in contrast to its one time healthy scepticism of convenient imc findings the dup will play the game and seek refuge in this further process of sanitisation of the wicked ira
1695713 further views and fuller assessment of the completion of the transformation of pira
1695714 the request is based on comments we made in our 18th report in may 2008 when we referred to relinquishing structures appropriate to a time of conflict as being the signal that a paramilitary group has emerged at the other end of the process of transformation
1695715 we also said in that report that in our assessment in practice this transformation was all but complete in the case of provisional ira pira
1695716 enormous progress has been made by people across northern ireland to deal with outstanding issues from the troubles however there are still vestiges of this time for which we need greater clarification
1695717 therefore i have written with dermot ahern from the government justice minister to the imc asking for clarification of their last report

1695734 we find that the record evidence is insufficient to define precisely the relevant product or geographic markets
1695735 without defining the relevant product and geographic markets we cannot perform a structural analysis to predict the likelihood of anticompetitive harms
1695736 indeed the merged firms ability to negotiate better terms for expensive talent could benefit consumers via lower rates
1695737 and it would not be in the combined companys interests to negotiate deals that harm the quality of content especially while seeking to increase subscriber penetration and so move to profitability
1695738 the proposed la carte system will allow consumers to in effect block unwanted or objectionable content that would otherwise be delivered to consumers sdars devices
1695739 furthermore in addition to the harm to existing sdars customers from a partial divestiture
1695740 it is not clear to us that a new competitor would have sufficient spectrum to emerge as a significant competitor to the newly merged entity nor is it clear that a new sdars operator could overcome the regulatory and business hurdles required to offer service
1695741 while we welcome the extra treatments commissioned that is just a statement of intent and they cant say that they will be delivered in fact they cant say how 3 7 million will be delivered
1695742 the problem is a crude target driven system that does into take into account patient need
1695743 we are confident that the vast majority of these treatments will be carried out this year
1695744 these latest statistics further underline the failure of labours experiment with a largely untested new dental contract

1695772 alex has brought in the experience he needs for this team and now he wants to add some younger legs to complement that
1695773 to the best of our ability we are trying to build a premier league standard squad if we can go up then we dont want to completely overhaul the team we want players who can move easily from one division to the other
1695774 i would imagine alex did his homework thoroughly on this player
1695775 he will have spoken to everyone he needed do as well as consulting our scouts i think quincy is going to meet the high standards we will be setting this season
1695776 alex is certainly very professional in his search for new players and in his approach to the situation he has challenged the board to go the extra mile and we have done he realises he is not dealing with an abramovich
1695777 im glad we did it i think it was a very good way to address a difficult issue in a way that was respectful of the employees
1695778 it has not gone as well as i had hoped originally but were treading new ground here
1695779 im happy in my position and had no plans to leave
1695780 were going to save 64 million of state money and by the 11th of august ill know how much of that we have accomplished through this round of the buyout process and well see where we can go from there
1695781 the problem is its going to get worse most people think as we go into the next year
1695782 as a matter of principle for me i would not treat someone better in the future who didnt take part in this first one
1695783 there have been very good moves involving ghanaian players this transfer season and this confirms the level of confidence big clubs now repose in ghanaian players
1695784 essien has renewed his contract which is a sign that he is happy there sulley has made a big move to inter milan asamoah is now at rennes and i have also moved to lyon it is a big statement and i am happy for myself and all my colleagues
1695785 like it did for many african countries whose nationals reigned on the big stage in europe it will be good for our football
1695786 you get an 800 one which we did last month and youre saying im going to need to get off my fanny and really find a way to stop this
1695787 you know there are power plants that run only 15 days a year on the hottest days of the year
1695788 why would we want to build more power plants when we could use the plants that we have more efficiently by shifting our use to off peak periods
1695789 many of our customers are comparing their usage to last year which was unseasonably cool for a texas summer
1695790 many are making conservation efforts for the first time in their lives
1695791 we have people coming in from highland park on a regular basis with 2 000 to 3 000 a month electric bills
1695792 the first thing they need to do is the first thing that i did and look at the efficiency of their house because those kinds of measures tend to pay back much faster than power generation
1695793 the results are very clear to see if you use the example of how power prices spike real time
1695794 if you can avoid high usage during those few hours of the year you can drastically reduce your spending 30 to 40 percent
1695795 there is still a lot of work to do with the team but one thing i am sure of is that the fans have their confidence in the club back
1695796 they are now sure that when they come to the stadium they will leave happy and this is key when you are playing in a competition of this magnitude
1695797 safas 2010 football legacy programme is informed primarily by challenges facing our regions and our local football associations so as part of our interventions we have partnered with theta to capacitate our members in administration and coaching throughout safas 52 regions
1695798 this technical workshop is a step towards developing a strategy that will ensure success for all our national teams in continental and world championships this process will involve government sponsors and other relevant stakeholders as it unfolds
1695799 a fourth product is essential it could be an suv it could be a hybrid we want a fourth product that buyers of the other three scions dont like
1695800 se da la planta el ctrica y la pel cula no se va a reproducir hoy
1695801 its actually not like the great adventure its not so much a quest movie its more of a war movie well okay its absolutely a war movie cultures grinding up to a horrible moment where it just all spills over and gets out of control less of an adventure party quest type situation more of an armies building to an inevitable conclusion type situation
1695802 while my heart lies with the horde and thralls an interesting character from a movie making standpoint a blockbuster movie its a little rough to try and tell it from the perspective of this green looking dude
1695803 we are starting those conversations were going to be looking for someone of zak snyder 300 or chris nolan the dark knight batman beings calibre
1695804 i can tell you that this is the one thing about running a studio and making these things thats hard you want to not compromise and have the right level of intensity the story and the directors vision is whats ultimately going to dictate that personally one of my favorite movies of all time is lord of the rings which has a pg 13 rating
1695805 98 percent of the 223 million or so cannabis plants eradicated by american law enforcement agencies in 2005 were feral hemp
1695806 activity levels on all our business fronts were high through the second quarter and on balance our operational performance was good
1695807 our production levels were slightly below expectations and may remain so for the balance of the year but continue to be strong given supply constraints ongoing in the sector
1695808 agriums exceptional second quarter earnings are a result of strong performance across all business units and the outlook for all our product lines continues to strengthen
1695809 the outlook for the second half of the year remains solid with corn wheat and soybean prices at two to three times historic levels
1695810 if the company is unable to repay its obligations when due or satisfy required covenants in debt agreements substantially all of the companys other long term debt will also become due on demand
1695811 real estate and credit markets have continued to demonstrate weakness to date in 2008 and we do not expect that we will be able to complete asset sales at acceptable prices as quickly or for amounts as originally contemplated
1695812 i did say to myself theres got to be a better way to make a living
1695813 i have to work hard here because the fact that i played for chiefs before counts for nothing i intend to take each and every match as it comes be it a friendly cup or league match i cant say what i want to achieve except that i want to be in the starting line up everything else will follow
1695814 put his troubles aside and regain the form that made him one of the deadliest strikers in south african football
1695815 as a result of the current environment and in order to enhance profitability we have decided to temporarily slow our store growth
1695816 they were impressed with him and thought that he had already signed with them however they have since discovered that he has returned to south africa and through djurgardens have made contact with me
1695817 we have three consultants working to ensure that we have the fund to run the game we do not intend to depend solely on host state sponsorship or the little assistance from the federal government these consultants are working it is unfortunate that the private sector have not been able to see the benefit and potential in partnering fepsga in the sponsorship of the games we are calling on them to come so that sports could also be developed in the civil service
1695818 the players in this camp are intelligent footballers who have a great future ahead of them in fact the oceanic football challenge project is worthy of commendation i am very happy and excited at what the future holds for nigerias football and i am quite sure you will be seeing some of these boys in the super eagles
1695819 the emphasis on character and educational development in addition to possessing great soccer skills is one aspect of the show that will effectively ensure that the players emerge as discipline football ambassadors even after retiring from the game again on behalf of nigerian coaches and the teeming football fans i say thank you to oceanic bank and ambassador john fashanu for giving our youths this golden opportunity
1695820 im not afraid neither are my colleagues we are used to being in the toughest groups at the world cup
1695821 mbele is joining the likes of stanley manzini and sibusiso nhlapo whom we signed from winners park recently
1695822 its not advisable to continue with the same training programme that we had at high altitude in nairobi at sea level here in beijing
1695823 we have prepared top run as a kenyan team and we dont care who is in the opposition we will stick to our game plan
1695824 we have the possibility of preventing crashes from happening altogether
1695825 at least 50 children are injured weekly and at least two children die every week from injuries sustained when a vehicle backed over them
1695826 is this an appropriate palate of sounds for the indians
1695827 every time sir toby enters i thought we might use something like this
1695828 they can come out just as easy as they went in
1695829 people make a judgment about you in the first five seconds after they meet you
1695830 and they are making a judgment about who you are
1695831 where do you want to be three years from now where do you want to be professionally where do you want to be socially
1695832 the first thing you need to do is find out what the fashion culture is where you are going
1695833 in italy you could probably interview in a paprika suit if thats a color that works for you i wouldnt recommend that in japan theyre not fashion forward in the business world
1695834 you need to consider whether you can wear open toed shoes sleeveless shirts or shorts to work thats your responsibility as a person going from one country to another
1695835 we had to consider that she was a female doing business in the middle east
1695836 coming to work in a short skirt would not be looked upon well
1695837 alterations and tailoring have a lot to do with how an article looks on you
1695838 its better to buy a size too big than a size too small the worst that could happen is people will think you lost weight
1695839 as americans i think we need to respect the people and places we visit you need to remember that you are a guest its not just the fashion part of it but the intellectual part as well you can have the right outfit on but if you dont have the right attitude it isnt going to work
1695840 americans think white socks are acceptable that is a big mistake youll see educated powerful people wearing white socks they should know better
1695841 one major faux pas is to be caught in a time warp wearing clothes that are totally outdated for women this would mean frosted blue eye shadow or bright red lipstick
1695842 the purpose of therapy is to help you not to judge you
1695843 where howard hughes played by leonardo dicaprio meets katherine hepburns family
1695844 thats because you have money you can afford to be socialists
1695845 in particular has been criticized by the left as being a piece of pro iraq war jingoistic propaganda
1695846 mostly i hear people say why did we attack iraq for instance well were taking on an idea nobody questions why after pearl harbor we attacked nazi germany it was because we were taking on a form of global fascism were doing the same thing now it seems to me quite obvious that our country and the entire western world is up against an existential foe that knows exactly what it wants and were behaving like a collapsing empire mighty cultures are almost never conquered they crumble from within and frankly i think that a lot of americans are acting like spoiled brats for some reason nobody seems to be talking about who were up against and the sixth century barbarism that they actually represent these people saw peoples heads off they enslave women they genitally mutilate their daughters they do not behave by any cultural norms that are sensible to us im speaking into a microphone that never could have been a product of their culture and im living in a city where three thousand of my neighbors were killed by thieves of airplanes they never could have built
1695847 in 2006 miller announced that his next batman book would be called
1695848 i was caught up in the hysteria during the vietnam era which was brought about through marxist propaganda underlying the so called peace movement the radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2 5 million people in cambodia and south vietnam did they stop the war or did they bring the war to those innocent people in the end they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away those same leaders who were in the streets in the 60s are very powerful today in their work to bring down the iraq war and to attack our president and they have found their way into our schools
1695849 african footballers love to improvise and keep the ball on the deck and were no different were capable of beating anyone on a good day we just need to impose our way of playing and trust in our instincts
1695850 one of the problems weve had over the years is we had no method to teach surgeons surgical skills without going into surgery
1695851 we now have simulators that help them develop those skills
1695852 while blu ray discs bd offering both 25gb and 50gb are sufficient for users current demands we envision the need for a technology that can support far greater capacities as hd streaming in particular becomes commonplace and users build larger files of digital content
1695853 the multi layered method is compatible with blu ray devices providing a long term future for the technology and is more easily produced when compared to competing technologies such as holographic storage
1695854 the outlook for growth continues to deteriorate with recession looking increasingly unavoidable
1695855 the consumer sector is bearing the brunt of the credit crisis with falling asset prices negative real wage growth and rising unemployment taking its toll on sentiment and spending
1695856 we suspect that most monetary policy committee members are still firmly in wait and see mode and in no hurry to move interest rates given the current major uncertainties surrounding both the medium term inflation and growth outlooks
1695857 possibly at some point this week but not today well issue details of a precise date
1695858 it the date for a market link has drifted and drifted
1695859 what you really cant put a number on is the impact on sentiment
1695860 clearly there is some opportunistic buying going on at the moment
1695861 we have seen numerous times over the past six months that 900 an ounce is a key support level and whenever gold has fallen below that it has recovered relatively quickly
1695862 platinum has been buoyed by interest in the sector linked to xstratas bid for lonmin
1695863 it shows a more positive view of the platinum situation in south africa
1695864 the strike and xstratas bid for lonmin this morning does suggest that there are still a lot of people who think the platinum market has a lot better times ahead
1695865 my links are all telling me theres going to be an announcement that the ville de quebec will be taken from natos standing maritime group and sent to waters off somalia to escort world food programme relief supplies to somalia
1695866 food supplies are urgently needed in somalia but deteriorating security has made delivery difficult by land and sea
1695867 abradable coatings such as ni 4cr 4al bentonite entail a family of coatings used throughout jet engines primarily as sacrificial coatings into which moving components wear the coatings generally consist of a metallic phase and a nonmetallic phase and contain relatively high porosity levels to 40 typical locations for application of an abradable coating include the fan and low and high pressure compressor sections
1695868 the composite nature of abradable coatings presents unique challenges from a metallography standpoint due to thickness and porosity considerations vacuum impregnation with a low viscosity cold mount epoxy is the recommended mounting method to facilitate impregnation with fast cure epoxies which are typically more viscous than slow cure epoxies the resin can be heated to approximately 150 f 65 c prior to mixing with the hardener holding the epoxy at elevated temperature for 15 to 20 minutes should result in a significant improvement in the viscosity of the epoxy
1695869 managing thousands of processor cores and multiple types of processors is a challenge we see every day and it will only grow in the future
1695870 the ibm hpc stack and other items in the repository help open source supercomputer users and systems managers keep pace with the rapid advances in cluster computing they are in constant need of improved software components since the hardware advances so quickly
1695871 the tournament just started and this was a good result
1695872 now we need to have a good preparation to play against brazil and germany
1695873 our game plan was to match them speed for speed and skill for skill
1695874 but unfortunately that didnt happen our game plan didnt work today
1695875 guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment in thermal spraying
1695876 it is the belief of the thermal spray society safety committee that every person is entitled to work in a safe and healthful environment
1695877 people are the most important assets in the thermal spray community and their health and safety are the communitys greatest responsibility
1695878 impressively quinn competed against undergraduate students masters students and ph d students from all across canada and tied for first place this is really prestigious particularly as this is the premiere conference for anyone studying and researching plant biology in north america and beyond many preeminent botanists were there
1695879 extraction partial purification and susceptibility testing of a potentially novel antibiotic from lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe arceuthobium americanum
1695880 we dont usually think of northern forest plants as important sources of pharmaceuticals
1695881 i was kind of surprised to find that the extract from dwarf mistletoe works against the so called superbug mrsa
1695882 it is not surprising that many tru graduates who have gone on to graduate school have indicated that they excel because they have already worked in a lab or in the field and have had the opportunity to engage in original research
1695883 one of trus distinguishing features is the dedication of its faculty in working one on one with undergraduate students who wish to engage in independent research students at the bachelor degree level benefit from being able to design and pursue their own research projects under the direct supervision and mentorship of a faculty member engaged in a similar line of investigation
1695884 hey if i went to your house and your mom made something really good i wouldnt eat just one bowl
1695885 when other countries host the olympic games they do it to make money but look at china its only for face
1695886 will be on the start list for tomorrow from the beginning and i am sure he can be here with us for the rest of the competition
1695887 i was sitting next to jerry colangelo and said you know weve waited three years to get off this plane and do this
1695888 i think were prepared and while were here we need to prepare more
1695889 its a little overwhelming that its really here the reality that were here
1695890 weve been treated with the greatest amount of respect and friendliness we could not have been treated better i know well get the same treatment in beijing the chinese people love basketball and were excited were playing the first game against china
1695891 i try to see american players every time they come to china but this time is the most special because of the olympics
1695892 a once in a lifetime opportunity and they should experience all those things
1695893 i hope to get my team ready to perform at the highest level to win a gold medal thats my only desire here and ill be ok with that
1695894 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1695895 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1695896 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1695897 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1695898 its so shocking being an american to see the blatant oppression
1695899 its very difficult for us now with all the problems we have had
1695900 we have had all sorts of problems including accreditation and so on and we now have two players who may not play on thursday
1695901 when you dont have all your players available the team just kind of picks itself
1695902 there is no pain when he walks but we will have to take him in for a scan later and see what happens hopefully he should be fine but if he cannot play that means we have only 14 players available
1695903 we have worked hard and prepared hard and these boys know what is expected of them so we will just have to go out there and do this country proud
1695904 gr nde f r die auswanderung von fach und f hrungskr ften aus wirtschaft und wissenschaft
1695905 das ioc darf es nicht hinnehmen dass bestimmte internet seiten nicht zug ngig sind das ioc muss raum lassen daf r dass sportler bei olympia ihre meinung sagen k nnen ein sportler muss sich doch f r menschenrechte stark machen d rfen alles andere ist absurd
1695906 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that
1695907 mr champagne will be visiting rwanda in the future and he will hold discussions with us ferwafa on how best fifa can help rwanda in improving its football
1695908 there is a strong feeling that this world cup should leave a legacy through out the african continent not only for 2010 hosts south africa
1695909 we aim to create better facilities increase management skills and access to football
1695910 we feel were still competing we want to make a positive impression to be the location for the next expansion
1695911 this part of the country can be very foreign to some folks and it can be an uphill argument getting them to relocate
1695912 i dont want to look like the gestapo i dont want to close anybodys business down if we close it down were never going to get the taxes lets give him one more try
1695913 without doubt id keep him hes 25 i think hes their best player by a mile
1695914 i have to keep reminding myself that these players come from all parts of society some have university degrees some have two some barely got through secondary school
1695915 you dont pass an iq test to get into a football club you pass a talent and a character test but unfortunately the intelligence test runs a distant third i am closer to the end than the start of my career and it makes me ponder whether all of it is worthwhile
1695916 but that is another emotion i know that i and the rest of the club will get over and drive ourselves forward for the encounter with st kilda
1695917 dar um tiro em algu m por ser homossexual e por supostamente ter rela es com um gato e por isso o animal ter ficado paneleiro o motivo mais torpe que j ouvi

1695920 i grew up as a goaltender and he helped me with my focus being nervous can be a good thing
1695921 dougie always did the best he could for us but we needed a little bit better
1695922 favells style was to make every save look spectacular the truth is that if we had gotten better goaltending in 1973 we could have gone further than we did we werent the most talented team but we had a lot of great players we believed in ourselves and we hated to lose bernie was the missing piece in goal every game we knew hed give us a chance to win
1695923 that was one of the most nervous nights of my career
1695924 it wasnt just another game to me i knew i had to produce playing against dougie just added to it
1695925 ive played before larger crowds but ive never received a greater ovation
1695926 it was fantastic and im sorry thats such a mediocre word the cheers went right through me deep inside me i couldnt say anything they just wanted me to sing
1695927 hes always kidding me about my shot he used to drop his glove in practice and invite me to shoot at his bare hand
1695928 right from the beginning whenever we had a game like that we knew bernie would be there and wed get the ship righted
1695929 brian eno and i recently finished our first collaboration in about 30 years
1695930 esse epis dio dos incorrigiveis foi das melhores coisas que j vi tuas acho que te podes orgulhar e muito dele
1695931 eu queria sinistramente roubar a autoria daquilo aos meus amigos santo pombeiro e moreira
1695932 this was a quarter of strong progress against our strategic imperatives especially the significant acceleration of our wireless business
1695933 wireless saw improvements in financial and operating metrics in the quarter including the highest level of postpaid net activations since the fourth quarter of 2005 significant growth in total net activations improvements in churn cost of acquisition and postpaid average revenue per unit and double digit growth in operating revenue and ebitda
1695934 disappointed with our high speed internet business this quarter but we are taking action to improve performance in the second half of the year
1695935 agriums exceptional second quarter earnings are a result of strong performance across all business units and the outlook for all our product lines continues to strengthen
1695936 this quarters results are a reflection both of the quality of our assets and the benefit of diversifying throughout the agricultural value chain
1695937 russia and norway have both defined areas of continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles to which they claimed
1695938 the areas of uncertainty relate to what canada denmark and the u s a will do in relation to the continental shelf
1695939 with these 2 000 seats added its going to add that much more crazy mystique to what mosaic stadium is
1695940 people should just be pumped bring the noise bring the heat and continue to cheer on the green and white to this unbeaten record
1695941 i think there were a few mike stands that stayed in the truck investigators are going to look for any elements that can help them try to find possible suspects
1695942 are there any fingerprints in the car were any elements left on the scene that might help them find possible leads in this case
1695943 the amplifiers the drum sets my bass guitar ronnys guitars thats what got stolen
1695944 igg was going off and the montreal people were pumped up
1695945 the spirt of people of coming and helping someone whos taken some blows its very kind of them
1695946 new evidence on the presumption against preemption an empirical study of congressional responses to supreme court preemption decisions
1695947 this note looks at congresss responses to every supreme court preemption decision between the 1983 and 2003 terms to see whether the facts support either sides argument ultimately this note concludes that neither side should make arguments based on likely congressional responses to the courts preemption decisions the data show that congress almost never responds to the courts preemption decisions
1695948 i doubt that the governor will sign it because i didnt support his transportation plan
1695949 my oh my a spring day in the big city where anything can happen and dreams are made
1695950 when we entered that apartment on the night that katelynns body was found my information was that she was sleeping on the floor in one of the bedrooms
1695951 it is probably the worst thing ive seen in 20 years of policing the worst
1695952 had i known i would have never in my entire life left katelynn
1695953 this is a horrific case and there should be a lot of public interest in it
1695954 she seemed like a much nicer calmer person she seemed to take her sons with her wherever she went
1695955 when i did a radio talk show and wanted to get the phones buzzing with irate callers i would say

1695965 the question is what will they do to differentiate themselves in an increasingly crowded market
1695966 when somebody does something wrong red doesnt jump in your face he does not disrespect anyone
1695967 you guys are the ones who are talking all about it

1695971 growing up even though breaststroke was my worst stroke i was still swimming that event in 2004 games the 200m free i knew it wasnt going to be an easy race i knew it was going to be a very very tough race to win but i didnt care i wanted to swim it i wanted to race in it and thats what i did and i felt successful being able to do a best time and being only a few tenths outside a gold medal he finished third behind ian thorpe
1695972 i think physically hes just much stronger and more mature so hes got a lot more power and still has the fitness
1695973 and emotionally hes much the same guy he handles challenges really well he wants to do well in his races and he has his own goals hes concerned about
1695974 the biggest advantage he has now is hes been through the process before so he knows what to expect and hes handled all the other things that come with the olympic games better

1696183 we call for an immediate investigation into this attempt on cuestas life which follows a pattern that journalists in the philippines know only too well
1696184 journalists in the philippines are frequently killed and assaulted with impunity all for doing their jobs in the past 10 years at least 25 journalists have been victims of premeditated murder in connection to their work
1696185 identify and punish urges the authorities to identify and punish those responsible for the shooting which comes just a month after the murder of a journalist in quezon province

1696195 i was going to greenville on sunday and as soon as i got into kinston i saw the hess station had gas at 3 59
1696196 we couldnt believe it because we had just paid 3 89 in jacksonville
1696197 its difficult to say exactly what is causing the differential depending on which two cities were talking about there could be a difference in types of fuel that are required
1696198 i believe when a new store opens you are allowed to sell at the lowest price you want for about 10 days to make a splash
1696199 most of the gas stations are run by independent businessmen and businesswomen so they can set their own prices its a highly competitive market
1696200 what happened the first half of the year retailers if they were lucky probably broke even when they were selling gas

1696202 so theres really not much play refining and distribution cost money
1696203 if you get a 10 cent increase wholesale you generally dont pass on to your retail price 10 cents a gallon because you know that customers will ditch you theyll probably ditch you for a penny so maybe you increase it 2 cents
1696204 when prices retreat retailers try to hold back price decreases just like they try to hold price increases just so they can catch up
1696205 youre looking at margins retailers in some areas are looking to extend margins in other areas somebody dove to the bottom and everybody had to match them
1696206 everybodys on the same flight but probably everybody paid a different price
1696207 there are times when the guy with the highest price on the street is making the least per gallon there are times when hes making the most per gallon
1696208 gas is largely becoming profit neutral or sometimes profit negative so that you can maintain a consistent customer count

1696345 stubbornly high world food and energy prices and the impact of the fuel price hike have generated heightened inflationary pressure in 2008 bank indonesia also sees that the upward trend in domestic demand has contributed to pressure in core inflation these developments underpin the decision by bank indonesia to raise the bi rate this month
1696346 inflation in 2008 could mount to about 11 5 12 5 yoy however we predict that with the various existing and future policies to be implemented by bank indonesia and the government inflation will ease returning in 2009 to the single digit level in the range of 6 5 1 bank indonesia will focus on mitigating the indirect impact of soaring fuel and food prices to this end bank indonesia will make optimum use of all available monetary instruments including adjustments in the bi rate control of exchange rate volatility absorption of excess liquidity optimisation of open market operations omo and other policy measures
1696347 in further steps for optimum control of omos bank indonesia will switch the operational target from the 1 month sbi rate to the overnight interbank rate with effect from 9 june 2008 with this change bank indonesia will manage movement in the overnight interbank rate at about the level of the bi rate
1696348 bank indonesia policy will remain firmly anchored in implementation of the inflation targeting framework within a free floating exchange rate regime an important part of this policy will be mitigation of exchange rate volatility in order to curb inflationary pressure looking ahead bank indonesia sees room for appreciation in the rupiah in line with the strong balance of payments position
1696349 inflationary pressure is forecasted to remain quite strong dominated by imported inflation related mainly to high international commodity prices
1696350 looking ahead in bank indonesias view the economy will continue to face challenges given the uncertainties besetting the global economy the indonesian economy in 2008 is predicted to advance more slowly compared to 2007 sustained high inflationary pressure is expected to pose added challenges for achieving the inflation target while the rupiah exchange rate will continue to move in line with fundamentals

1696368 on the other hand former governors who are standing trial for alleged corruption involving billions of naira are all on bail under the rule of law and have been gallivanting from one country to the other many of them have secured injunctions from their state high courts stopping their trial
1696369 where a public servant is charged with a criminal offence he is immediately interdicted suspended pending the determination of the case there are prominent political office holders including legislators who are currently facing criminal trial but are at the same time holding their offices
1696370 there is a dichotomy in the wages of public servants and political office holders while the nigerian public servants are about the lowest paid in the world political office holders are about the highest paid in the world people who are earning n7 500 00 as monthly minimum wage are still expected to go to court and enforce their rights when violated
1696371 there are cases where foreign multi national companies and their officials are charged to court and punished for bribing nigerian officials under the rule of law in nigeria nothing is happening to these officials alleged to have received the bribes
1696372 notwithstanding the exponential increase in the price of crude oil the average citizen is languishing in poverty as a result of corruption nigeria has continued to be one of the lowest ranking countries in the world in the corruption perception index cpi of transparency international yet there is absence of any serious commitment on the part of the government to fight corruption
1696373 the two presidents reaffirmed their commitment to improving the human rights situation in north korea and shared the view that in the process of normalizing relations meaningful progress should be made on improving north koreas human rights record
1696374 made it clear that they are committed to helping north korea integrate into the international community and thereby partake in the peace and prosperity on the korean peninsula and in northeast asia
1696375 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist
1696376 president bush raised the human rights issue to pressure the north at a time when his administration is in the process to delist pyongyang
1696377 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1696378 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1696379 today i am sad to say that since 2004 we have seen no less than 5000 alleged cases of corruption involving persons in government departments and local government structures
1696380 while these are allegations some of them have proven to be true
1696381 the feedback rates suggest that over the mid term departments have generally not been able to strengthen their capacity to deal with cases of alleged corruption

1696385 we could merge into one big vote in parliament but we have not yet talked about one big party but we have much optimism to merge
1696386 when three parties merge they are a good looking competitor with the cpp because they have equivalent force
1696387 we have long time to talk about merging we will not deny our ability to merge but what we are focusing on right now is rejecting the election results
1696388 the major source of inflationary pressure in 2008 is the impact of the fuel price hike and soaring food prices however bank indonesia is also aware of mounting demand side pressure in line with the rapid expansion in credit and the money supply lasting through q2 2008 added to this are indications of stronger inflation expectations that could trigger second round effects for this reason bank indonesia sees the need to raise the bi rate to prevent knock on effects from the fuel price hike and food prices on other goods bi will stay the course with flexible measured use of existing policy instruments to curb inflation in 2009 within the 6 5 7 5 range to achieve this bi will coordinate actions very closely with the government in 2008 and until the end of the national election in 2009 indonesias economic growth is predicted to remain strong buoyed by high levels of private consumption and government and adequate export performance

1696412 on our way from the event we met the three mobile policemen at ayobo around 9p m on saturday one of them who saw that almost all of us were in the same aso ebi asked us to go

1696414 we reported at the nearby police station and were promptly attended to by a fine officer mr isinjola who tried his best to console us and even visited us at the hospital he later called us when the men were arrested and askd us to identify them which we did
1696415 a man who looked like the commandant of the mobile police officers later visited us at the hospital and insulted us with his offer of n20 000 which we refused and since then he has not called back

1696446 it was the biggest struggle ever in burmese history not just in one town but even in remote villages the whole country was marching in the streets
1696447 twenty years afterward well you know we wont see that kind of demonstration happen again in the near future
1696448 and if it happens we know that as long as this government is in power they will crack down
1696449 isolation has pushed the burmese military toward authoritarian regimes instead of democracies
1696450 so its time for the west to think about these issues in perspective and try to engage the military
1696451 the most important development of the last 20 years is not so much suppression of the democratic movement but the opening up to china
1696452 i think the life of the ordinary burmese people in 10 or 20 years from now will depend much more on how that relationship evolves than almost anything else
1696453 we have a long history of isolation in burma and that has given the military a free hand to do anything it wants

1696459 our economy is in turmoil and our families are struggling with rising costs and falling incomes with lost jobs and lost homes and lost faith in the american dream
1696460 weve always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own our people are losing that faith not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy
1696461 in little more than two decades weve gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries at prices that are going through the roof
1696462 back then we imported about a third of our oil now we import more than half
1696463 will we allow ourselves to be held hostage to the whims of tyrants and dictators who control the worlds oil wells
1696464 our excessive dependence on opec has already taken a tremendous toll on our economy and our people
1696465 these efforts will cost money a lot of money and that is why congress must enact the windfall profits tax without delay it will be money well spent unlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil these funds will be paid by americans to americans
1696466 i believe we should immediately give every working family in america a 1 000 energy rebate and we should pay for it with part of the record profits that the oil companies are making right now
1696467 in just ten years these steps will produce enough renewable energy to replace all the oil we import from the middle east
1696468 i am tonight setting the further goal of cutting our dependence on foreign oil by one half by the end of the next decade
1696469 think about how world war ii forced us to transform a peacetime economy still climbing out of depression into an arsenal of democracy that could wage war across three continents
1696470 just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation helped us win world war ii so will we mobilize american determination and ability to win the energy war
1696471 ill also extend the production tax credit for five years to encourage the production of renewable energy like wind power solar power and geothermal energy
1696472 i am asking for the most massive peacetime commitment of funds and resources in our nations history to develop americas own alternative sources of fuel from coal from oil shale from plant products for gasohol from unconventional gas from the sun
1696473 think about when the scientists and engineers told john f kennedy that they had no idea how to put a man on the moon he told them they would find a way
1696474 we ourselves are the same americans who just ten years ago put a man on the moon
1696475 we will set a goal of making our new buildings 50 percent more efficient over the next four years
1696476 im asking congress to mandate to require as a matter of law that our nations utility companies cut their massive use of oil by 50 percent within the next decade and switch to other fuels especially coal our most abundant energy source
1696477 and well invest in the technology that will allow us to use more coal americas most abundant energy source

1696482 the loss of integral jewish community has meant that jewish commitment is a matter of choice that is nowhere more true than in contemporary america where the freedom to participate fully in the life of the larger society is in every respect greater than has ever been before indeed is nearly absolute we are living moreover in what is very likely the most mobile society that has ever existed on the face of the earth it is no wonder that the jewish community in this situation has to argue for every single jewish soul compete for every pledge of allegiance against and ever increasing wealth of beckoning possibilities and must do so not once in a persons life but repeatedly year in and year out because each of us not only decides where to live but with who and how
1696483 why we hate us american discontent in the new millennium

1696518 children and teens are now exposed to a host of sexual behaviors that less than a generation ago would have been considered off limits for broadcast television

1696539 i believe that 20 time is very important though i dont like the way weve stagnated a little in the innovation and
1696540 we are really trying to get a feature done on time so far its going really well but i kinda feel like i would rather keep forward progress on my feature
1696541 we made the decision to delay 20 time until after we shipped 2 8 it hasnt been that hard to take time when ive wanted since then
1696542 our team leader has embraced 20 time and there is no difficulty in taking it the feature i am currently working on is running on time so this probably helps if we were running behind time it may be different

1696567 someone said to me it was appalling i didnt speak welsh it makes me squirm
1696568 others have said if you are not a welsh speaker you cannot call yourself welsh
1696569 i would not dream of going to france or spain and not learning the language
1696570 people support the eisteddfod far better in north wales than they do in the south
1696571 in mold last year they worked hard for the eisteddfod people embrace it but i would say things like this get lost in a big city

1696624 serpente s ma gatto no il direttore della sala stampa vaticana ha passato due giorni a smentire larrivo a kenthurst di un gatto che secondo una voce
1696625 gi che scherno senza rispetto per le altrui inclinazioni un po come negare a due omosessuali di sposarsi o negare ad una donna laborto riportandola a quel suo sacro costume di sfornatrice di prole quale sarebbe bene tornasse ad essere allacquajo e zitta
1696626 sisi che tristezza sono vuoti e senza valori b proprio oggi ne ho parlato con alcuni ragazzi della parrocchia se queste persone atei e non praticanti vedessero un esorcismo credo che si farebbero sacerdoti
1696627 we are conscious of what the amazon represents for the world
1696628 as long as we recognize the power within us we will continue to have choices and we will continue to lead
1696629 a war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1696630 you have to know what youre talking about you cant grandstand
1696631 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
1696632 doesnt look like all those other presidents on dollar bills
1696633 when obama says hell only tax the rich hes saying he will only tax the engine room not the rest of the ship
1696634 he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
1696635 indeed when i come to the children of israel and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what shall i say to them
1696636 thus you shall say to the children of israel i am has sent me to you
1696637 we are looking for a clear positive response from iran and in the absence of that were going to have no choice but to pursue further measures against them
1696638 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1696639 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1696640 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1696641 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1696642 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1696643 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1696644 if every american were to pitch in 2 000 we could pay off this years deficit or if we handed over each of us 500 gallons of gasoline or in terms we could all really understand if every american gave up 666 lattes for a year we could pay off this years deficit
1696645 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
1696646 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
1696647 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
1696648 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
1696649 how can you given the passion that you feel about this issue turn down the idea that you could be in the administration as a vice president or as an energy czar or as both
1696650 president clinton played to the center not the left in selecting ruth bader ginsburg and stephen g breyer
1696651 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
1696652 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
1696653 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1696654 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
1696655 with book like these the minute some people know theyre out there they must have them
1696656 the anti obama readership is largely one that has already made up its mind and is looking for validation while the obama readership comprises both those who have already made up their minds and those who are curious about him
1696657 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1696658 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1696659 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1696660 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1696661 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1696662 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1696663 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1696664 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1696665 by and large these are not run to identify spies they are run to thwart what the officer is trying to do to us and to learn more about what they are trying to do to us
1696666 it can also pay off enormously in intelligence as in football an offense can be the best defense
1696667 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1696668 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1696669 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1696670 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1696671 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1696672 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1696673 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1696674 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1696675 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1696676 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1696677 if there is a significant increase a major nuclear renaissance with a large number of new plants a second repository may be needed
1696678 this is a major message to america and america is listening
1696679 while a very small band of your colleagues remain on the house floor to discuss gas prices their constituents deserve to know why their representatives in congress have failed to support serious responsible proposals
1696680 its really unfortunate that congress left for yet another recess without dealing with pending nominations especially for key officials dealing with energy issues like our nominee for deputy secretary of energy and three nominees to be commissioners of the cftc commodity futures trading commission
1696681 today i fired up my super duper 386 sx in a huge cardboard box

1696695 these people allegedly hacked into the wireless network used by tjx in stores and installed programmes on the network that enabled them to scan or sniff the network traffic going in and out of the company
1696696 gradually they set up their own messaging system within the network similar to a legitimate intranet this case shows that tjxs wireless network was not very secure and it wasnt monitoring strange traffic any company that takes security seriously would have its network secure and monitor constantly for suspicious activity
1696697 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1696698 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated computer hackers
1696699 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain

1696705 second quarter growth was weak forward looking indicators are gloomy sterling money market spreads remain elevated
1696706 the essence of the liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held but in how they are held instead of being held dogmatically they are held tentatively and with a consciousness that new evidence may at any moment lead to their abandonment
1696707 ernest hemingway f scott fitzgerald and william faulkner were motivated in their famous postwar novels not by their experiences of the horrors of war but rather by their failure to have those experiences
1696708 to mccain anyone is expendable even his most loyal supporters
1696709 i knew this would be the reaction from those who slapped their thighs and guffawed over mcbushs joke
1696710 but nearly everything youll ever hear mccain saying is from a script too and as has been noted time and again he just cant get the hang of reading a teleprompter gwb has been reading tightly prepared scripts for years it hasnt kept him from looking like an idiot a childish drooling lame brained unconcerned idiot and a sadistic evil man to boot one other thing im pretty sure i detect in parts of this script at least some input from paris herself so i dont exactly agree with your point

1696734 il resoconto stenografico della giornata segnala anche il paragone fatto da berlusconi tra il ministro mara carfagna e santa maria goretti
1696735 i dont think a cop or a social worker gets the same window into people we get they tell us the truth because were cab drivers and why not
1696736 from three years ago im paying 2 more per gallon well i burn about 20 gallons per day so compared to three years ago im making 40 less per day seven days a week thats 280 a week
1696737 i smoke cigarettes i eat food i drink pop thats 20 or 30 bucks there so i clear 10 bucks
1696738 you cant pay a cell phone bill on that and you sure cant make a house payment
1696739 there are days when drivers have to take money out of their own pockets to pay the lease especially in the summertime
1696740 a lot of the new drivers cant make ends meet they usually find out in the first week or two id say about 50 percent get out of the business right away a few years back almost no one bailed that quickly
1696741 i think this is just going to become a lot more of a transient business
1696742 people in the service industry still tip because they understand tipping but they are the only ones you can still count on waitresses bartenders and other cab drivers
1696743 if we eliminated one third of the cabs on the road we could get by without a meter increase
1696744 the cab business has gotten bad because they relaxed the requirements and let all these new drivers in
1696745 if you go to office of adult economic assistance in downtown minneapolis youll see a lot of cabs there and theyre not there to pick up customers theyre getting assistance
1696746 if you have 100 000 people in town thats got to help any driver who knows the business should make some money
1696747 im sure there will be more money but traffic is going to be a real hassle and getting to the convention center is going to be almost impossible
1696748 it used to be a lot of suburban and inner city working class people people who grew up here drove cab for 20 or 30 years
1696749 you could put your kids through school you could pay for a house now you make 50 60 bucks a day if youre lucky
1696750 i could do parties and with a limo plate i could legally pick up customers anywhere not just st paul
1696751 in my cab there are three rules dont shoot the driver pay your fare and no male nudity
1696752 if i start driving limo i might have to get rid of that third rule i guess ill just have to figure out what i need to charge if a guy takes out his junk in my car
1696753 pip is based on the semiconductor packaging technology whereas pop is an application of the board packaging technology
1696754 in contrast to pop where packages are connected with each other via solder balls pip integrates one package into another and connects them via bonding wires so i believe that pip has a higher connection reliability than pop

1696761 you dont want to run a 260 000 deficit year after year
1696762 i think the heart of it is to go out and ask more people
1696763 they both need new space maybe it would be more effective to do a building together rather than each one doing their own
1696764 we have the franchise on art museums in st paul
1696765 emerging minnesota artists great minnesota artists of the past we are all over those niches
1696766 thats something worth doing there ought to be a museum that collects and shows minnesota artists that is a strong emphasis of ours
1696767 if there are say large st paul based corporations that arent on our donor list but give generously to others we want to get on those lists
1696768 we are hoping that some generous group of republicans wants to have a party in the gallery
1696769 we will leave it up through the convention if we have a taker
1696770 i expect so much out of myself and thats why im so disappointed tonight
1696771 joba was down and we didnt have a great outing last night out of our starter and its my job to make sure i take us deep in the game i take a lot of pride in doing that and its just extremely disappointing when youre not able to do it and it hurts
1696772 vilified and despised for confronting terrorists in the only terms they understand
1696773 everybody hits rough patches but when the manager comes out to get you you hand him the ball and show him the respect he deserves i dont know how it looks to fans but i know how it looks to 24 other guys it doesnt look good
1696774 guys are going to struggle that is part of the game thats not the issue there is a way to act and carry yourself the way he left was unacceptable and disrespectful hes somebody we need and somebody we have to get right the physical issue becomes the no 1 priority for right now but that doesnt excuse what happened on the mound
1696775 the packers will release you over ted thompsons dead body theyre not going to give you the chance to run through the tunnel opening night as a viking
1696776 it hasnt been that big of a change im the same third down player and i may play a few more plays
1696777 i want a bigger role one down to me is not enough
1696778 you want players on your team who want to play and want bigger roles and who are hungry
1696779 thats what makes this camp harder is you have players everywhere and guys want spots thats a good dilemma to have from a coachs standpoint from a players standpoint you gotta make some noise
1696780 the process is hard but im just going to continue to do it
1696781 if you ask 32 nfl teams where you would play this guy theyd play him at fullback
1696782 he didnt really have an opportunity to debate it with me
1696783 im sure hed rather play tailback which hes more naturally in his mind suited for
1696784 but for us to win and for his future success fullback is a position where his talent will be highlighted
1696785 he has excellent hands and the mass that allows him to block people and hes still a talented runner
1696786 it was devastating just by seeing what a typical fullback does
1696787 until coach cromwell and the staff really sat me down and told me my role theyre going to utilize me and not keep the ball away from me
1696788 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1696789 i think the market realizes this kind of pressure from congress may in fact lead to a change in policy

1696844 this calls for development cooperation based on constant dialogue between the two sides of the development partnership while implementing the principles of aid effectiveness
1696845 this designation does not portray the complete picture of social and other conditions in our respective countries in many cases there is a disproportionate distribution of wealth and income with some sections leading opulent lives while others endure abject poverty

1696891 non ho un barlume di simpatia per chi parla dal punto di vista del culto organizzato le religioni non sono altro che corporation strumenti di potere politico e finanziario senza relazione con il dio che professano di servire si travestono con costumi bislacchi per dispensare precetti e causare guerre non ho allevato nessuno dei miei figli secondo le tradizioni ebraiche e non so neppure quando cadono le feste sono un antisemita no penso solo che il mondo sarebbe assai migliore senza religione

1696903 the festival is like a shop where all the major us producers go to look for new productions c to get invited to stage the show in new york that is the aim
1696904 we will still use the suburb names but the story will be set in a fictional city c the accents will all stay the same we are making an effort to cast australian actors in new york

1696919 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet
1696920 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1696921 the other factor is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1696922 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1696923 it is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity
1696924 some of the samples contained toxic metals including lead in quantities as much as 100 times above levels found in uncontaminated soil and sediment samples
1696925 the nature and extent of chemical contamination found at these sites in ghana is similar to that previously exposed by greenpeace for e waste open burning sites in china and india
1696926 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue

1696956 we need to be prepared for what could in reality be a crisis in home heating this winter
1696957 heating oil prices are expected to be around 5 per gallon and thats going to make things especially difficult not only for low income individuals but also for working middle class families in our state replacing an old furnace or boiler with a new efficient one can save hundreds on energy costs and thats a savings that many will need this year this is an opportunity for families to replace their furnace systems now with help from the state to help make this winter a little easier i urge all of my constituents who meet the qualifications to get on the list and take advantage of this program
1696958 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1696959 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1696960 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1696961 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1696962 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1696963 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1696964 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1696965 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1696966 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1696967 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1696968 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1696969 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1696970 iowa minnesota wisconsin and perhaps indiana are very important states mccain is behind and hes in danger of falling further behind
1696971 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1696972 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1696973 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy

1696981 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1696982 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1696983 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1696984 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest

1696988 we feel it was an error for the judge to take the verdict away from the jury
1696989 it has always been apollo groups position that the plaintiffs in the case did not suffer any damages arising from the disclosure of the initial government report and its unsubstantiated allegations and we are pleased that the court has agreed
1696990 all of these allegations are baseless and concocted the book should be withdrawn from all the sale points throughout the world

1697052 microsoft will evaluate the potential exploitability of vulnerabilities associated with a microsoft security update microsoft will apply a value to the vulnerabilities associated with a microsoft security update information will then be published in the exploitability index as part of the monthly microsoft security bulletin summary
1697053 consistent exploit code likely this means analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit that vulnerability this would make the vulnerability an attractive target for attackers therefore it is more likely that exploit code would be created as such customers who have reviewed the security bulletin and have determined its applicability within their environment might treat a vulnerability with this value as a higher priority
1697054 functioning exploit code unlikely this means analysis has shown that exploit code which functions successfully is unlikely to be released while an attacker could create exploit code that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior it is unlikely that an attacker would be able to create an exploit that could successfully exercise the full impact of the vulnerability therefore once customers have reviewed the security bulletin to determine its applicability within their environment they might prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release

1697159 what would i have done i dont know what i know is that from my vantage point the case against invading iraq was not made
1697160 i have always said i would listen to commanders on the ground i have always said the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability that assessment has not changed and when i go to iraq and i have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground im sure ill have more information and will continue to refine my policies
1697161 i will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to america

1697172 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1697173 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy
1697174 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea 28 days ago is a slide in his poll numbers

1697187 i was born the 9th of april 1960 in the south of italy in latronico it is a really beautiful area in the middle of the mountains of basilicata my parents had a big farm there as a child it was great to be raised in the middle of the nature we left and moved to prato near florence when i was 9 my parents decided to take such a step to provide me with better schooling
1697188 well actually i was first attracted by football i started to play quite seriously but when i was 15 my sister gave me a motocross bike fantic motor 50cc for christmas my passion suddenly changed from football to motocross at first i was not able to ride the bike but i started practicing a lot when i was done with my school duties i was always on the bike
1697189 yes once i left school and started working as a loader i also started racing
1697190 sure i have many but i think the very best one is when i and my friends luigi zompetti and massimo matteoni went to our first race
1697191 can you please stop your teeth from chattering i cannot sleep
1697192 i had a massive accident when i was 17 and broke three vertebrae doctors forbade me from racing for the rest of my life i should have stopped but my passion was so strong that three months after i had come out of the hospital i was still in plaster i was on the bike again
1697193 when i was about 23 i started following the fim 125 motocross world championship
1697194 the most beautiful main event of supercross ever seen in europe so far
1697195 the first time i met wolfgang srb was in talavera in 1995
1697196 when you have a real plan to put motocross on television then we can talk
1697197 we have seen a further improvement in the sports we promote with a lot of important sponsors entering the series red bull hyundai mormaii monster sidi lovemytime and many more are all great partners of ours and each of them correspond to a different market meaning that the sport is touching more and more business areas the popularity of both motocross and supermoto is increasing thanks to the great passion of the fans who come to the event in crowds and also watch the sport on tv and through the internet streaming we recently saw some amazing events such as the latest red bull fim motocross of nations in budds creek usa and the fim supermoto of nations in pleven bulgaria which have been the peak of a fantastic 2007 season now more than half a million fans come to the races more than 900 hours of television are broadcasted all over the world with more than 700 million television viewers and more than 250 journalists following the world championship at every grand prix
1697198 thinking of world championship races motocross of nations masters of motocross and international events that i have attended i can say i had the chance to work in close contact with most of the riders who helped making the history of our sport pit beirer has such a strong desire in whatever he does and a huge passion for life he is really a personage stefan everts has impressed me for his talent and his strong will he is surely the greatest rider in the history of our sport andre malherbe has a big place in my heart he is really a gentleman and a big example of our sport rick johnson jean michel bayle and ricky carmichael have all to be greatly admired i have worked with many other big champions but the ones i mentioned are very special because they are more than great athletes they are great men
1697199 with my work and my private life i have had the privilege to meet a lot of important people like adrien brody micheal douglas sharon stone ornella muti olivier martinez and a lot of others connected to the show business politically i have met prince rainier of monaco prince albert of monaco george bush senior lech walesa j rg haider umberto bossi and other ministers from many different governments i have had the pleasure to meet also kenneth lay ceo of enron and magic johnson people who impressed me the most were prince rainier of monaco and lech walesa they made me feel respect for them they were simple but i felt their strength and power in the show business i really like adrien because he keeps both feet on the ground and he is simple in his private life
1697200 i believe everyone has their own idea and manner of managing their work but one strong example of good sport management is bernie ecclestone people say many things about ecclestone but one thing is sure he is the man who invented the way of managing sport even now he is 10 years ahead of everyone else not all the things he does for formula1 can be applied to motocross but there are many principles that can be used
1697201 yes that is right i have a very good relationship with fim actually like mr ezpeleta mr flammini and the other fim promoters fim owns the rights that we manage as promoters the agreements are very clear we have to care about the promotion and business and fim makes sure we work in the right way by controlling sport and fairness

1697214 i had a really tough session on monday and got through it really well and have pulled up fine today so i think thats a good sign and the physio and the doctor are happy so ill take the field gasnier said
1697215 the tigers have already said how desperate they are so i think its going to have a feel of semi final football out there he said
1697216 i think maybe sonny might not have that long in the game with the injuries he had maybe he thinks he does not have much longer in the game and needs to get out of it what he can
1697217 its getting to the point where its getting quite embarrassing
1697218 we need to show plenty of heart this week and get some pride back in the jersey because at the moment were just embarrassing ourselves and the club
1697219 you can come up with thousands of excuses about why were going bad but at the end of the day theres not one player thats going to stop us from getting 40 points put past us
1697220 once we get behind on the scoreboard the heads are just going down at the moment and the excuses come out so weve just spoken about getting rid of that and turning things around
1697221 weve been saying that every week but weve got to do it now
1697222 provided he doesnt trip over a pothole or something like that hes pulled up fine and he moved well
1697223 its been a pretty cautious approach for gaz i think perhaps in years gone by you might have rushed a player back say last week but hes just making sure hes ticked all the boxes
1697224 garys form up until he got injured was as good as ive ever seen
1697225 probably since hes been injured jimmys form has been as good as garys was so it would be nice to sit there on brownlow night and see one of the boys win it
1697226 but theres so many good players out there and thats a really tough one
1697227 last year there was a whole lot of expectation and the unknown was really exciting and it was new it was fresh all those sorts of things
1697228 a lot of anxiety crept in about this time of year we were probably a bit gung ho to get towards the finals
1697229 our form not necessarily dropped off but fluctuated probably plateaued a little bit
1697230 this year im not thinking about winning a premiership like i was last year as such so its more of a level headed approach
1697231 robert stands equal with the greatest midfielders in the game he has stood the test of time
1697232 roberts still playing a high standard of football hes probably in our top six in the best and fairest this year
1697233 but you dont want to push things until they break hes in a position to go out on his own terms playing good football
1697234 someone that consistently gave their best at training and in games
1697235 training was always important to me to be seen as a good trainer
1697236 im very happy and honoured to have stretched my career out for as long as i did
1697237 its the right time for the club its the right time for myself ive had a great run

1697242 ridiculing idealism is shortsighted but idealism without the rigours of pessimism is misleading
1697243 what shocks the conscience is in the eye of the beholder
1697244 remember that our lives on this planet are too short and the work to be done too great that those who live with us are our brothers and sisters that they share with us the same short moment of life that they want like us to live that life in happiness and fulfilment
1697245 your commie has no regard for human life not even his own and for this reason men i want to impress upon you the need for extreme watchfulness
1697246 surely human affairs would be far happier if the power in men to be silent were the same as that to speak but experience more than sufficiently teaches that men govern nothing with more difficulty than their tongues
1697247 really i think that the poorest he that is in england has a life to live as the greatest he and therefore truly sir i think its clear that every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government and i do think that the poorest man in england is not at all bound in a strict sense to that government that he has not had a voice to put himself under

1697250 it is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and honorably and justly
1697251 i was drawn to do something tangible to combat a big social problem in our society today which is the achievement gap
1697252 students in these communities dont get the kind of education that i got in the community i grew up in
1697253 i dont think i would have gone into teaching if it werent for teach for america
1697254 tfa allowed me to get into the classroom without having to go through a two year masters programme tfa has four rolling deadlines each year
1697255 they put me into a boot camp before i start teaching and they allow me to hit the ground running a traditional approach would have deterred me
1697256 im only 22 so my options are open this is going to lead me onto staying in education or trying something completely different
1697257 i didnt want to go straight into grad school i think this is a great way to begin to think about a career
1697258 the leaders of our generation want significant responsibility at entry level this allows you to be a leader the leader of a class you set the expectations
1697259 that level of responsibility is an incredible opportunity those two combinations are what appeal on the one a chance to develop themselves and then also fulfil an incredible mission
1697260 part of the criticism of tfa is that it is a temporary fix
1697261 one big issue they face is recruiting long term teachers people come in do their two year theres never a large veteran staff

1697274 who could be bounded in a nutshell and count himself a king of infinite space
1697275 one of the most richly textured best acted versions of the play we have seen in years
1697276 ive seen bolder hamlets and more moving hamlets but few who kept me so riveted throughout
1697277 there can be no complaint about the supporting performances least of all oliver ford daviess polonius
1697278 revolutionary drama we have seen to the dimensions of a standard gory revenge play
1697279 whats lacking at present is weight and depth he delivers the great soliloquies with clarity but he doesnt always discover their freight of emotion
1697280 this is a gripping hamlet that could become great if tennant finds the courage to raise the dramatic stakes still further
1697281 is that for all the stage door excitement and box office success this is not the greatest dane
1697282 maybe its because hes such a tv pin up or maybe his interpretation of hamlet light on power politics heavier on personal hiatus is likely to appeal more to the female mind
1697283 falling vehicle prices and the negative equity it is creating continues to pressure sales trends
1697284 unfortunately for carmax we dont see any reason for a quick turnaround in those trends
1697285 while this is clearly a difficult environment for us we remain confident in our superior consumer offer and our long term growth opportunity
1697286 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1697287 marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1697288 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1697289 xstratas offer reflects the operational weakness that lonmin has seen which has made lonmin vulnerable
1697290 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly
1697291 xstrata is easily big enough they can afford to buy lonmin certainly
1697292 this partnership is the best of both worlds for me and my management team
1697293 we can keep control of our creative challenges and operations while accelerating our growth doing projects all over the world
1697294 we are dramatically ahead of the aggressive plans weve established
1697295 we stand by what we said in that we have to deliver the benefit to our shareholders and to our customers
1697296 on the listing side it has not been a good year for ipos
1697297 were managing the firm to not have to access the government support
1697298 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1697299 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1697300 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
1697301 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
1697302 we are seeing signs of progress from our efforts to improve the customer experience rebuild the sprint brand and increase our profitability
1697303 made the key decisions that will enable us to run aols access and audience businesses separately beginning in 2009
1697304 is along with goldman sachs one of only two investment banks in the world to remain profitable since the start of the crisis
1697305 lives up to its reputation as one of the most solid banks in europe
1697306 thanks to its highly diversified earnings streams the bank is in a better position to absorb financial market stress than many of its peers
1697307 given the turmoil on the financial markets those are satisfactory
1697308 we identified the challenges of the future in good time
1697309 eight years after starting work on this im very excited to see the first data
1697310 i think it will help all of us to better protect our health and clean up our waters
1697311 these tools are tested and i think our people for the most part use them extremely judiciously
1697312 oregon pesticide use shows similarities with what neighboring california has been finding through their reporting system
1697313 one years data is interesting but we hope the reports collected this year and in the future will help provide a more clear picture of trends in oregons pesticide use
1697314 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
1697315 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
1697316 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
1697317 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness

1697338 runs the risk of erasing the active agency of the palestinian subject represented as either passive victim of israeli dispossession or aggressive insurgent but with interpretative control wrested away
1697339 the inclusion of israel in the state of exception debate
1697340 tempting as it might be it can reinforce the global immunity israel receives for its membership in the camp of democratic states the very discussion of israel within the parameters of this debate assumes that israel is another case of a western liberal democracy dangerously deteriorating into the abyss dreaded by agamben
1697341 israel uses oppression to defend it against democracy leading to the maintenance of the state of oppression
1697342 de democratizing israel could give palestinian resistance hope for change if israel is seen as a permanent state of oppression the palestinians may glimpse a light at the end of their tunnel of suffering and abuse
1697343 israel is a scandalous case of the modern paradigm of sovereignty because it reveals what lies beneath the smooth surface of other countries the persistence of the exception in israel the ongoing state of emergency the violent moment of birth and the persistence of its ethnic nature are features that one might find in some countries at some points in time israel is unique in that all of these features are present most of the time
1697344 palestine has become the emblematic solidarity movement of our time our spanish civil war our cuba our nicaragua the use of palestine as shorthand for inter ethnic conflict and seemingly intractable difference has taken on a new significance with outcomes that are bad for palestinians and for antiracism in many other places
1697345 talk about palestine without much attention to the situation of palestinians
1697346 a highly intelligent and enterprising race backed by large financial resources
1697347 a comparatively poor indigenous community on a different cultural level
1697348 it is not that might makes right in this case it is that might manufactures the conditions and parameters the terms of political and by extension historical and representational possibility
1697349 problematic position as an exiled citizen of israel and as such a member of the perpetrator group in relation to representing palestinian subjectivity
1697350 a kind of memory that was deliberately and systematically hidden
1697351 orientalist discourses of remaking and interpreting the east especially the use of womens rights to construct a picture of palestinian society as primitive and the tendency to present palestinians as native informants rather than experts
1697352 were not interested in hearing palestinians present any overarching political narrative
1697353 is an issue which israeli organizations need to promote more than palestinian ones
1697354 by the time i saw them they were already on me
1697355 they started kicking and beating me i couldnt protect myself there were about 25 of them
1697356 they consider us nothing more than mosquitoes not human beings as though we didnt exist
1697357 i did hear there was an arab who fell off a roof if an arab falls off the roof they blame the jews its a totally false accusation
1697358 a jewish man was hit and scuffles ensued and the security forces were called to the best of my knowledge the first blow was landed by an arab
1697359 they are using the gap in the government to get more land to evacuate people from their houses

1697364 back to school may mark the end of long summer days but with the new didj leapster2 and tag handhelds it doesnt have to be the end of learning fun
1697365 whether parents want to help prepare their children for back to school learning or build on what they will be studying in the classroom kids will enjoy learning with a wide range of engaging games and books that feature their favorite movie and tv characters
1697366 before today ends another 3 000 students will drop out of high school and before the year ends more than one million will have left school we dont have a dropout problem we have a dropout crisis
1697367 each year almost one third of all public high school students and nearly one half of all blacks hispanics and native americans fail to graduate from public high school with their class many of these students abandon school with less than two years to complete their high school education
1697368 dropouts are much more likely than their peers who graduate to be unemployed living in poverty receiving public assistance in prison on death row unhealthy divorced and single parents with children who drop out from high school themselves our communities and nation also suffer from the dropout epidemic due to the loss of productive workers and the higher costs associated with increased incarceration health care and social services
1697369 increase public awareness of the dropout crisis secure commitment for integrated collaboration between the corporate private public and school sectors engage schools and provide exposure to strengthen and support their efforts to help disadvantage youth identify and inspire local leadership to get involved in community school initiatives mobilize leaders around the alliances three national action strategies in addition the dropout prevention summits will bring attention to high need populations create a place for topical discussions which will lead to the development of an action plan build upon existing local education reform efforts and provide opportunities to influence local state and federal policy these summits are more than a single event they are part of a national call to action on behalf of the americas promise alliance for states and communities to outline clear actionable steps that will significantly improve the graduation rate

1697383 i told him he had two choices that he could go to school and spend a lot and learn a lot or that instead of going to school he could spend three years getting paid low wages and just work in kitchens and learn
1697384 if you walk into a kitchen and say i want to spend six months here as a prep cook i want to work hard and learn those of us in the business are grateful
1697385 if you want to be a doctor or a lawyer you kind of have to go to school but cooking is a trade im sorry but its a blue collar job
1697386 when i think about modern cooking school education ive got young kids getting out of school carrying 60 000 in debt and they come into my office and i tell them 9 50 to 10 an hour to start and theyre being told by cooking schools theyll start out making 15 an hour
1697387 i have had culinary students who have done well and those who didnt do well and ive had employees with no experience do well its all about individual personality
1697388 i look for passion whether theyve gone to school or not because then i know they will pay attention that their answer will always be yes chef
1697389 doing culinary education correctly is an expensive proposition and we believe you have to put in significant time you cant shorten the cycle
1697390 we have classes that purposefully put the student under a fair amount of stress and comprehensive exams that are very serious
1697391 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1697392 unless something really weird happens i dont see the fed moving before the november election
1697393 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case
1697394 that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge
1697395 today i will let parents know that i do not serve to enable their children

1697397 the international leg of the beijing olympic torch relay was close to a disaster that was beyond the control of the ioc and the organising committee
1697398 my view is that there should be an analysis of how this happened and a resolution to do away with the international portion of the torch relay the high risk and low reward of the international leg is now obvious
1697399 we had to put his bottle back in the bag because all of the other kids kept trying to take it from him
1697400 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1697401 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1697402 find out where i can fly to get the best tan oh maui
1697403 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1697404 its something i feel strongly about not because of my own nostalgic feelings for the program but because i feel it is still such a special nurturing voice in the lives of children

1697409 great but how am i going to fit that in with everything else that im trying to do and everything else that i keep saying im going to do
1697410 i need to get a pillow under hubbys knee so its not sore from elevating his foot all night
1697411 i have too many birthday gifts to buy tomorrow and only an hour to do it
1697412 what did you have for dinner last night what about lunch what was the last book you read what are your favorite movies where do you like to eat
1697413 what are you doing hows your palate if i put a blindfold on you and have you taste five herbs can you name them do you really f ing want to do this without the mentality you can go to any school in the world and it wont matter
1697414 at cia i was trained under european chefs real chefs who would kick your ass and thats the way it was done
1697415 i trained under eugene boom boom bernard everyone in the program was afraid of him
1697416 i got my ass kicked learning the ability to cook correctly and thats the way it was done until little mary jane went to school and went crying to her parents that the chefs were yelling at her and mom and dad went and complained to the dean
1697417 it wasnt welcome here are your knives they broke us down
1697418 many of our students are nontraditional or are career changers and are not in a position to do a 90 hour workweek
1697419 most people assume you go to a culinary program to be a chef and work in a kitchen thats a large part of it but the industry has grown and morphed
1697420 typically its in the low 30s for someone with an associates degree going into a kitchen
1697421 a bachelors would be leaving closer to the mid 30s but theyre in management tracks and in position to be promoted and moved around in a much faster time frame
1697422 it is not a good atmosphere while this is going on were all aware there could easily be a major blaze weve been told to look out for anyone acting suspiciously
1697423 we have attended two fires at this site both started in a quantity of cardboard boxes both may have been deliberate fires and we are working with security on the site and will reinforce the no smoking policy
1697424 we can confirm there was a fire on monday within the new hospital development with everyone safely evacuated from the site
1697425 so what does the bible have to say lets take look
1697426 surely i was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceived me
1697427 religion is unbelief it is the one great concern of godless man
1697428 how then can they call on the one they have not believed in
1697429 how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news
1697430 why are we so lucky to have the gospel while others have not heard
1697431 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
1697432 salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved
1697433 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all men
1697434 im delighted its been so well received it has been screened at numerous short film festivals but millions will now be able to see it
1697435 my inspiration for the film came from everyday life experiences it depicts a young man on a train who is trying to pluck up the courage to speak to the girl sitting next to him i wanted to portray a realistic experience that other people can relate to
1697436 we wanted to offer a life changing opportunity for film makers who have struggled to get exposure
1697437 the floods of 2007 show just how serious flooding can be and i am glad to see that this project has been developed to enable people to have a greater understanding of the risk of flooding
1697438 a number of decisions need to be taken when we look at managing the risk of flooding including our annual spend on flood defences where and how we build new houses and the emergency procedures we have in place for times of flood
1697439 the game gives the game player the opportunity to make informed decisions about all of these policy areas
1697440 shoppers have told us that they want organic produce but want to pay prices closer to the standard equivalent and this is what we have done
1697441 on top of shoppers tighter budgets most uk retailers have increased the price of organic produce as a result of last years poor harvest caused by flooding across the country
1697442 in fact last years organic harvest was the poorest in british farming history and many farmers are still counting the cost of a much lower yield
1697443 jullie zijn daar met zn allen bezig geweest jij was er ook bij en had een duidelijk aandeel dan maakt het niet uit wie precies wat heeft gedaan
1697444 hij duwde dat ding in mijn handen en zei dat het wel eens van pas kon komen ik hou helemaal niet van wapens
1697445 my hot model friends and i are waiting around for you
1697446 i have now reached the point at which i no longer care whether or not the answer is nuclear let it happen we can no longer afford any rigid principle but one that the harm done to people living now and in the future must be minimised by the most effective means whatever they might be
1697447 these are difficult questions and the environmental movement is diverse we are working through them together collectively looking at the difficult questions actually its a really good sign that there is not a party line where everyone says and believes the same thing
1697448 im delighted to award george monbiot the gold medal for slow learners a lot of people reached exactly this conclusion a long time ago and im not sure that hes such a monumental figure that hes going to cause that many ripples
1697449 if you actually unpack all of those caveats as listed by monbiot and once youve got a chance to reflect on them youll realise that in those caveats is basically an impossible route for nuclear they could never meet all of those conditions what most environmentalists would actually say is that if the industry and scientists can come up with solutions to those problems particularly the risks caused by proliferation security risks risks associated with nuclear waste and decommissioning if scientists can get real breakthroughs in those areas then of course we have to be open minded and think about the role that nuclear might play but the truth of it is right now and george knows this as well as anyone which is why hes so off line here is that they are nowhere near meeting any of those conditions over the next years decades
1697450 chief justice john roberts wrote for a 6 3 majority that the international courts judgments cannot be forced upon individual states
1697451 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1697452 s s state s blocked s waited s r n
1697453 what i love most about them is that they left so much of themselves behind
1697454 i suck at relationships i should have been a guy
1697455 have lost family and my home to a bloody war
1697456 friendfeed is basically a custom tailored home page for people who are obsessed with the internet
1697457 as any baseball fan will attest one hit does not a hitting streak make nevertheless federal webmasters can take heart from the latest report of the university of michigans american customer satisfaction index acsi e government satisfaction index
1697458 friendster a pioneering social network surpassed by myspace and facebook in most of the world is still going strong in asia and now it plans to build on its success there
1697459 the fire department uses twitter to post information about fires or other emergencies that it is responding to these messages are then sent to users signed up to receive the information on their mobile devices
1697460 the only role for nuclear weapons is to be abolished
1697461 brown was in many ways fortunate he couldnt be blamed for the floods personally
1697462 and wed have gotten away with it if it wasnt for that pesky gordon brown
1697463 even more pathetic than last years failed terrorist attacks are the people whod have us believe that such attacks are going to succeed in destroying western civilisation where hitler hirohito and stalin failed
1697464 as both porillo and short pointed out over the weekend his rise has been through patronage not outstanding work or popular acclaim
1697465 rupert keep pretending to be a eurosceptic and get rid of that brown bwaaaahhhaaa bwahhhaaaaa haaaa
1697466 jeff randall writing in the daily telegraph where he is a senior executive said he would not trust mr cameron
1697467 to describe camerons approach to corporate pr as unhelpful and evasive overstates by a widish margin the clarity and plain speaking that he brought to the job of being michael greens mouthpiece
1697468 in my experience cameron never gave a straight answer when dissemblance was a plausible alternative which probably makes him perfectly suited for the role he now seeks the next tony blair
1697469 if you look at obamas past campaigns he has a habit of waiting and then doing a mad dash at the end
1697470 some said a non starter many thought they were smarter but he ended pm ch and om an earl and a knight of the garter
1697471 what all this suggests is a general election that is much tighter than many analysts predicted and defined by far more stubborn levels of support
1697472 nearly half 48 of the public says they have been hearing
1697473 he was associated with the history department at edinburgh for 15 years from matriculation in 1967 through the award of his honours degree to the completion of his phd in 1982
1697474 ill agree that karl rove and dick cheney are extremely bright
1697475 he is a visiting fellow at nuffield college oxford a governor of the ditchley foundation a member of the council of the institute for fiscal studies a member of the global aging commission a member of the advisory board of the british council visiting professor at the cass business school and economic adviser to dresdner kleinwort wasserstein

1697512 there is nothing that the aclu could contribute to the courts resolution
1697513 even if the court had the discretion to allow the aclu to brief purely unclassified legal issues such participation would be meaningless
1697514 because the fisa amendments act has such sweeping implications for the rights of u s citizens and residents any consideration of these issues should be adversarial and as informed and transparent as possible

1697559 there are some things you cannot get merely because you can say youre a friend of god and there are some things you cannot get just because you serve a god that is just there are some realms you can only enter into through persistence
1697560 there are realms in god that can only be touched in a hannahs prayer as she prayed for a child she was just beside herself in groundings and travailings in prayer theres the praying through the night
1697561 the persistent crying out the day and night crying out is what demonstrates you believe youre a friend of god is what demonstrates you know you have access to the justice of god where he will defend and vindicate you there is something profound about persistence
1697562 once you know that youve anchored into the will and the purposes of god it is very very important that you do not lose heart
1697563 what i feel like the lord is wanting to establish and cultivate in the heart of his people is that refined focus that says live or die i will not stop im alive for one single purpose we read psalm 27 this morning the psalmist wrote this phrase one thing i desire and that will i seek and i ask you this question have you reduced your life to one desire yet have you been able to distill all thats going on in your life and just bring it down can you get it down to one phrase can you get it down to one statement is there one cry that for you that encompasses the whole deal
1697564 locking into something you know is the heart of god
1697565 some things come through friendship and some things come because you appeal to divine justice but there is a realm you cannot touch apart from sacrificial persistence

1697568 when samuel beckett was a young name in the early thirties and trying to find a basis from which he could develop he wrote an essay known as beckett proust in which he examined prousts views of creative work and he quotes prousts artistic credo as declared in time regained the tasks and duties of a writer not an artist a writer are those of a translator this could also be said of a composer a painter or anyone practising an artistic metier an artist is someone with a text which he or she wants to decipher beckett interprets proust as being convinced that such a text cannot be created or invented but only discovered within the artist himself and that it is as it were almost a law of his own nature it is his most precious possession and as proust explains the source of his innermost happiness however as can be seen from the practice of the great artists although the text may be strong and durable and able to support a lifetimes work it cannot be taken for granted and there is no guarantee of permanent possession it may be mislaid or even lost and retrieval is very difficult it may lie dormant and be discovered late in life after a long struggle as with mondrian or proust himself why it should be that some people have this sort of text while others do not and what meaning it has is not something which lends itself to argument nor is it up to the artist to decide how important it is or what value it has for other people to ascertain this is perhaps beyond even the capacities of his own time

1697740 world bank policy makers have argued for example that poor countries should not consider providing treatment to the afflicted and that prevention programmes should come first even if people were dying in absolute agony

1697753 and we all know what difficulty you have in retaining friendships
1697754 when the signing has taken place rights might be violated so to prevent violation of certain rights of the people the court decided to issue the tro
1697755 we submit to the sound discretion of the supreme court
1697756 it is the ultimate arbiter of issues and so the signing will have to be canceled
1697757 its just a resetting of the signing this is one of the dynamics of democracy
1697758 its a setback but we will let the panels decide on whatever measures they want to take to address this recent development
1697759 these negotiations include definite military national security and diplomatic concerns and have involved the presence of a foreign mediator this being so the entire process the negotiations involving the said moa and the draft documents thereof resulting from said negotiations is covered by the doctrine of executive privilege which prevents the disclosure of information that could subvert military or diplomatic objectives
1697760 they do not have an unfettered access to everything as these rights are subject to certain limitations

1697762 petitioners do not stand to suffer any irreparable or material injury as the final decision on whether they shall be part of the expanded armm or not belongs to the people of north cotabato
1697763 nothing would get done as numerous interests and heightened emotions would get in the way of compromise
1697764 the nondisclosure of the provisions of the moa has deprived the people of its right to information and to participate in the decision making process this is a blatant violation of the constitutional rights of the people
1697765 to hide behind the mantle of national security so that the people would remain in the dark on matters affecting their lives and properties is a travesty of justice and of the constitutional rights of the people
1697766 we are confident that the supreme court will uphold the position of the panel in crafting this momentous and historical agreement that will address the longstanding problems of mindanao and the country as a whole
1697767 this will allow a dispassionate objective discussion of the merits of the issues that surround the said ancestral domain agreement so it might be good that at this early stage the supreme court will be part of that due diligence effort in taking a look at this agreement in its totality and also take a look at its provision
1697768 this is an important lesson for government peace panels that on matters that affect peoples rights they must be consulted first
1697769 we all desire peace in mindanao but it must not be obtained at the expense of our territorial integrity and certainly not by methods that desire transparency and are in apparent haste

1697832 i wanted you to kill me what i feel towards you is not right as much as i wanted to live with you i knew you wouldnt not after what i did and if i hadnt killed them they would have separated us and i didnt want that

1697850 you mean you havent noticed and i thought uchihas were meant to be perceptive
1697851 they look at him well more like glare at him like hes i dont know some kind of a monster i guess
1697852 i know how can he let that stuck up bitch live with him
1697853 yeah cant he see that were soo much better than her
1697854 yeah i still cant understand how could sasuke kun do this to us
1697855 fine i have a ninjutsu im quite sure you will like its
1697856 i understand this may seem a bit weird but i was wondering if i could speak to yuuko
1697857 well can you blame me as far as i remember seeing you after only a day was bad enough i cant imagine how it would be now after four years
1697858 isnt it a bit weird to stare at your so called daughters breasts
1697859 no because i know youre not my daughter but seriously are those real
1697860 the hokage and i both agreed that i was a danger to the village if i stayed
1697861 it would have been painful plus i figured that sarutobi sensei would tell you everything
1697862 i i was stupid back then i mean i thought that he wouldnt hurt me after all hes still my father and i thought i mean hoped that he would treat me the way you did the way i always wanted him to treat me
1697863 i it was horrible what h he did to me i it was h horrible
1697864 im sorry can we do the training thing tomorrow i kind of need to be alone right now
1697865 no need to yell at me miss i came early because i was worried and i still am for you dumbass have no idea how weak the security here is do you i mean i practically just waltzed in here and i wasnt even stopped so they could confirm my identity if you want to hide yourself in sound you have to work a little harder for it got that
1697866 bu i you you have no right to order me around
1697867 for the love of god what did the old geezer tell you then
1697868 it doesnt matter what sarutobi sensei said i had these doubts from the start
1697869 your loyalty i guess i mean its not like i dont trust you its just hard for me too see anyone as anything but orochimarus spy i mean god can you blame me
1697870 youre not pulling out the are you cause honestly im getting sick of it i helped you i am your friend and i have had to stand your bitching and moaning for too long now you and i both know that i hate orochimaru just as much as you do hell maybe even more and that i have every reason to so if you dont want my help fine its not exactly like im making you except it
1697871 if youll stop being such an airhead and think for one second maybe you can see that i really want to help you because i care so if youre ready to trust me again ill be in the village for a week then im leaving for sound

1697881 just because you have an emotional quotient of a teaspoon
1697882 the outer sydney south region stretches from camden to sutherland theres going to be massive variation in prices within that region
1697883 the major price fluctuations that occur on a daily and a weekly basis at most supermarkets will be missed
1697884 and not knowing exactly what products make up each basket means you dont know whether it applies to you
1697885 if we tell them 250 grams of nescafe is on the list they will drop the price so they look better but then raise the cost of something else
1697886 but im here to ride my race and play my role as part of the australian olympic team not to upset anyone but of course yes i have my opinions
1697887 sixty forty no for the time trial at this stage
1697888 trying to bring awareness of the tibet movement is something someone in my position can do
1697889 i just feel really sorry for them they dont harm anyone and they are getting their culture taken away from them
1697890 i dont want to see a repeat of what happened to the aboriginal culture happen to another culture
1697891 most students can complete 13 years of school and be awarded a senior certificate without having to demonstrate minimally acceptable standards of proficiency across a range of fundamental domains such as reading writing numeracy science civics and citizenship
1697892 what every child should know and be able to do
1697893 finally what did you get lost while coming to answer the door
1697894 well i need to see her didnt she tell you that somebody would come and help her hide or something
1697895 you will do as i ask when we are finished with you you will be my greatest achievement
1697896 its okay youre not there you escaped long ago remember
1697897 okay what the hell happened i saw that injury on the back of her head what did you do to her you little brat
1697898 i didnt do anything my fan girls ambushed and kidnapped her dragged her into an alley where they beat her for living with me she got the head injury from the vase they used to hit her head with to get her unconscious
1697899 no its not that just the idea of yuuko getting kidnapped by fan girls like impossible i wish i could have seen her expression when she realized just who had caught her off guard
1697900 and how did they manage it anyway youre like a hellcat when angry
1697901 i wasnt exactly angry more like annoyed as hell only you and one other person can make me angry
1697902 oh this is ketricken ill be leaving with her some time during the next three days or so
1697903 yeah i promised sasuke that if he would let me stay here i would teach him some jutsus
1697904 hey thats not a bad idea you okay with both of us teaching you sasuke
1697905 well just go and get ready then how about we train in the garden it looked big enough
1697906 great come on ketricken and stop staring at him like youre about to murder him or something some people arent as loudmouthed as you yknow
1697907 i made it easily blockable so stop whining and get on with it
1697908 are you mad what the hell were you thinking using that here what if someone saw
1697909 oh like you didnt use a some what highly dangerous and suspiciously difficult jutsu on me
1697910 yeah all of our big fights turn out like this and these jutsus are supposed to be hokage level
1697911 sure and maybe you can fight one of us later as well to practice your taijutsu
1697912 hey im gonna go and get something to drink you coming
1697913 hey sasuke why exactly did you agree with me staying here
1697914 i told you already he captured me and tortured me for information i didnt have
1697915 my father he does experiments on people i was one of his achievements i guess i mean thats what he called me
1697916 ketricken had the same procedures done on her as well but she had gotten a slight overdose on well i dont know how to call it we call it chakra fluid and she managed to escape i guess i wouldnt know exactly cause i met her after my escape my father he planned to make me just as powerful or maybe even more but he was doing other things as well things that would make me obey him so i wouldnt end up like ketricken
1697917 they didnt work though and i still escaped but i got caught again by some organization cant remember the name soon after i met itachi my personal torturer he had been assigned with getting the information on the procedures and because i was a result of one of them he thought i knew what they were and how they were done when i tried to explain that i had been heavily drugged and couldnt possibly remember what my father and his assistant did to me it fell on deaf ears after a while it came clear that i was of no use to them and so they decided to expose of me but i managed to escape and after that ketricken found me wandering in the woods around the organizations compound she took care of me and helped me to recover
1697918 ketrickens hide out was soon found by my fathers minions and they attacked us i was in no condition to fight but she managed to protect the both of us we escaped she told me that she had a trustworthy friend in grass country and that we would be able to hide there but i wanted to come here and meet up with a few old friends before going into hiding i picked you as a house mate because i knew that if you were anything like itachi you wouldnt bug me with questions unlike everybody else ketricken went to grass so the place would be ready when she would come and get me since she is more powerful than i am we agreed that we would go to the hide out together in case those minions found us again
1697919 so thats why you can do those jutsus and you didnt know about the phoenix fire technique before you read about it in my scrolls
1697920 i was out there being interrogated hoping you would come and help me and youre here drinking orange juice
1697921 apparently you didnt see the look he gave you when you were off in
1697922 what look and ill have you know i was thinking about our miserable past you nincompoop
1697923 the look that clearly said that he was suspicious and had his mind set on getting some answers from you and nincompoop girl i need to teach you some new insults
1697924 never mind that you deserted me what kind of a friend are you anyway
1697925 i told you that i was drugged i dont know what they did to me
1697926 i was training and it got late before i noticed
1697927 shes spending the night at grandmothers house sasuke is with her
1697928 and you were held captive by an organization called the akatsuki
1697929 and they freed you on the condition that you would train your torturers little brother so that boy could hold his own against your torturer
1697930 tell me everything that happened aniki i want to know what techniques you used
1697931 of course and does it actually work you have nowhere to plug it
1697932 not really take a seat ill go get some food and then ill heal your wounds
1697933 yes he told me right away after you had left for your mission
1697934 h he was drunk itachi he was drunk and he regrets it and he promised it would never happen again it was a mistake a terrible mistake i know but it happened and i wont let it tear our family apart
1697935 sasuke would be better off without that man now that i think about it he would be better off without you as well
1697936 i was his first experiment with the chakra fluids and i assume youre the one who replaced me after my escape
1697937 okay first of all does that mean that he did to you what he did to me and what are chakra fluids
1697938 yes only i didnt get the second poison the one meant to destroy your will luckily that didnt work anyway and chakra fluids are what they injected into you its kind of hard to explain what they are or how they were invented probably one of kabutos projects but their effect is that they heighten your senses enlarge your chakra and give you more stamina if you get injected for three times a day seven days a week for about two months the effects will be permanent after that the more chakra fluid you get the greater your chakra becomes
1697939 overheard a couple of conversations between your father and his assistant
1697940 thats all i just explained to you that youre probably more powerful than a kage and all you can say is ah
1697941 since i dont know how long you received the chakra treatment i wouldnt know how powerful you are
1697942 oh i thought the number would be smaller i hoped it was a year
1697943 i guess i need to tell you something else as well
1697944 like why orochimaru never used the chakra fluids on himself
1697945 i will not tolerate my own son being disrespectful towards me i am still your father boy and you would do best to remember that
1697946 you stopped being my father when you decided to use me as a stress reliever good day
1697947 what i did was wrong i admit it i should have done this a long time ago but i was ashamed and the only way i could express my shame was through anger i truly regret what i did im sorry son and youre right im not worthy to be your father
1697948 youre right it was wrong too wrong but i forgive you and ill try to put this behind us mother was right we shouldnt let this tear out family apart
1697949 how could he do this to me his own daughter
1697950 i have to go meet a friend of mine im taking sasuke with me and we should be back by midnight
1697951 he was right you look just like her what a beautiful boy
1697952 wrong like it wasnt supposed to be in my body
1697953 im not sure after they injected it right before the procedures they would tell me to calm down and i would but it felt so wrong it messed up my insides and i ended throwing up every time kabuto didnt exactly like his lab being covered with puke so they stopped giving it to me after the first few weeks
1697954 what are we supposed to do know just wait until it finally happens
1697955 i dont know i guess thats what i have been doing for the past five years
1697956 i dont want to wait it would be too agonizing dont you think
1697957 well we know exactly when it happens so not exactly
1697958 but still i dont want to sit here and watch how it happens to you only to have it happening to me as well
1697959 lets live life day by day i hear thats the most fun
1697960 yes i saw it ill talk to him about it tell him not to forbid him anything to stop it from happening
1697961 yes wouldnt want sasuke to go through what i did
1697962 of course i have always been only your son while sasuke is your
1697963 thats what youre doing isnt it you would do anything to protect him but when it comes to me you have already given up havent you mother
1697964 i say it because its true he wont listen to you and you will give up again but unlike you i will protect sasuke i will do
1697965 that the poor boy was sexually abused twice by his fathers colleagues no less
1697966 yes and no one knows who exactly the rapers were and everyones saying that they will go for sasuke kun next
1697967 after i had knocked the sound four unconscious i prepared to attack him as well when he appeared out of nowhere but he told me to run
1697968 no way hes like orochimarus perfect servant no way would he disobey him
1697969 maybe your father didnt give an order to capture us
1697970 i mean that maybe they found out by themselves or maybe kabuto sent them deciding to surprise his master kimimaro never liked kabuto much
1697971 who exactly did you summon you never mentioned that you made a blood contract with an animal
1697972 i made a blood contract with an earth demon and i managed to summon the high level demon lord yesterday first time i managed it actually
1697973 nothing i cant handle plus he agreed to help me in the end thats good isnt it
1697974 i guess i never knew you could do a contract with a demon i never knew demons existed apart from the biju of course
1697975 where else should we go the tree house is out of the question and no town is safe now that the sound four are after us
1697976 no i mean really you mentioned having someone you know there and orochimaru wouldnt think i was so stupid to hide right under his nose which makes this plan so perfect by the way
1697977 that somehow sounds good yet utterly ridiculous fine well go to my friend and then we will lay low as much as possible the sound four probably knew our whereabouts because of our partying at the town
1697978 seems good to me how long should we lay low though
1697979 it might and then again it might not no one knows what the future brings
1697980 yeah i am if im going to help him in the future the least i could do is start to build some of that trust between us that is needed if i am to be his personal tutor
1697981 you never told me the details of the blood oath scroll
1697982 i dont know yuuko konoha is quite far we need to go to sound as soon as possible plus ryu doesnt even know were coming and im not sure if shell welcome us with open arms
1697983 well then its settled ill go to konoha while you go to sound to make the arrangements
1697984 yuuko that is too dangerous if we go we might as well go together
1697985 i need to do this on my own give me two weeks
1697986 fine but only two weeks if something happens youre the one to blame
1697987 p please w why are you d doing this itachi s son
1697988 yes ill do anything you ask of me but just can you do one thing for me
1697989 next time when you feel the urge to fill my mind with your memories dont

1698003 i also have to say something serious which is i am very proud to be in this industry and i am very proud to be known as one of its greatest cheerleaders and while book publishing is certainly facing many challenges i know that it will survive and it will thrive and thats because of all of you in this room so we have to all remember that its important
1698004 so anyway what im going to say and this is it is

1698083 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars

1698109 i see the cellphone as the modern day trojan horse
1698110 in the beginning of the grecian era the trojan horse while appearing to be a gift in reality carried soldiers that invaded the city the cellphone is todays trojan horse it appears to be a wonderful gift while inside lurks a dangerous enemy invisible harmful electromagnetic radiation
1698111 there is research that shows bluetooth devices may be as harmful as the cellphone itself you now have a microwave transmitter living in your ear right next to your brain while the power level may be lower from the bluetooth it is constantly transmitting its like sticking your head into the microwave oven but hoping its ok because you are setting the power level low
1698112 and i like to think of myself as specializing in health care as distinct from sick care and well being as distinct from treating the patient and the symptoms to simply making the pain go away my experience is while the medical world may be early adaptors of leading edge diagnostic systems they are often late adaptors of preventive concepts and systems such as the delta shield i have protected my family with this device and i strongly urge my patients and friends to use it

1698118 in this report there are unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1698119 one can question the objectivity of the mandate given to the independent commission charged by the rwandan authorities with gathering evidence showing the french states involvement in the genocide committed in rwanda in 1994
1698120 we cannot of course be surprised by the conclusions of this commission given its name
1698121 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda beyond this difficult past remains intact
1698122 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1698123 it is possible to question the objectivity of the mandate of this independent commission charged by the rwandan authorities to gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1698124 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1698125 we continue to place our relationship with rwanda within this forward looking perspective
1698126 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1698127 did we for example systematically take the side of one camp against another hutu against tutsi that is an untruth
1698128 did we fail to denounce the genocide committed by hutu extremists starting in april 1994 that is an untruth
1698129 did we remain passive when the rest of the international community was taking action that is an untruth
1698130 during my time as head of french diplomacy from april 1993 to may 1995 we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans

1698153 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state

1698162 the time will come when from the earth will arise a mystic fog which will dilute the minds and hearts of all people
1698163 when the end is near we will see a halo of mist around the heavenly bodies
1698164 so the time will come when we will experience late springs and early frosts this will be the sign of the returning ice age
1698165 we believe militarism is born out of injustice poverty and ignorance where absolute governments refuse to hear the grievances of minorities
1698166 according to prophecy the day will come when people in high places will be hunted
1698167 it is in the prophecies of the hopi that in a case like this the navajo may help our cause also the bahannas or the paiute tribe may help we doubt that the u s government will easily concede our sovereignty
1698168 there are two water serpents one at each pole with a warrior sitting on his head and tail
1698169 it is said that if the future generations find out that we did nothing to preserve the good ways they might throw us from our houses into the streets
1698170 let us take a look into the future through the eyes of our prophets
1698171 industrialized nations will become careless in getting more the resources out of the earth
1698172 modern man looks upon old wisdom and knowledge as dead useless and no longer respected
1698173 the hopi play a key role in the survival of the human race through their vital communion with the unseen forces that hold nature in balance the pattern is simple the whole world will shake and turn red and turn against those who are hindering the hopi
1698174 this prophecy is related to the biblical version of that which may yet come to pass
1698175 the liberators will come in from the west with great force
1698176 if this fails to materialize our great creator through nature will do the task according to their sic plans
1698177 eventually a gourd full of ashes would be invented which if dropped from the sky would boil the oceans and burn the land causing nothing to grow for many years
1698178 the final stage called the great day of purification has been described as a mystery egg in which the forces of the swastika and the sun plus a third force symbolized by the color red culminate either in total rebirth or total annihilation we dont know which
1698179 the reality that it will be very violent is now almost taken for granted among traditional hopi but man still may lessen the violence by correcting his treatment of nature and fellow man
1698180 the man made system now destroying the hopi is deeply involved in similar violations throughout the world
1698181 since mankind has lost peace with one another through conflict due to the new ways the great spirit the great creator has punished the people in many ways
1698182 now we enter the time of testing that only the great creator can confirm
1698183 ambitious minds will decrease while the people of good hearts who live in harmony with the earth will increase until the earth is rid of evil if the hopi are right this will be accomplished and the earth will bloom again the spiritual door is open why not join the righteous people the horny toad woman gave massauu a promise that she would help him in time of need saying she too had a metal helmet after the hopi have fulfilled their pattern of life massauu will be the leader but not before for he is the first and he shall be the last
1698184 the time will come when from the earth will arise a mystic fog which will dilute the minds and hearts of all people their guidelines of wisdom and knowledge will falter the great laws of our creator will dissolve in the minds of people children will be out of control and will no longer obey the leaders immorality and the competitive war of greed will flourish
1698185 according to prophecy the day will come when people in high places will be hunted this will get out of control the hunting will gather strength and spread this situation might even erupt on our land finally this will lead us to the biblical version of armageddon the hopi version is closely related a final decisive battle between good and evil this will occur under one god or chief the prophets say we will speak one language and that this will happen in hopiland in the village of oraibi where the new life plan will be drawn in the pattern and cycle of religion here also a final decision will be made for the wicked they will be beheaded and speak no more if this does not materialize there will be a total destruction through the acts of man or nature then new life will begin from a girl and a boy this is a frightening prophecy and will not be supported by many
1698186 it is said that if the future generations find out that we did nothing to preserve the good ways they might throw us from our houses into the streets
1698187 it is as if metaphorically these events are already evident it came to me of the thoughts of man the thoughts being almost dead end hearts cold and not open with love and compassion for there earth and fellow brother
1698188 here also a final decision will be made for the wicked
1698189 there you have it read all that and then if you still dont understand ask me your questions

1698202 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me serves as the slogan for the group founded by mara vanderslice the former director of religious outreach for the kerry edwards 2004 campaign
1698203 as christians we find john mccains recent ad the one incredibly offensive
1698204 this ad tries to portray senator obama as some kind of messiah and mocks those who support him as cult like followers looking for a new savior even more troubling many view the ad as a dark attempt to portray senator obama as an anti christ figure
1698205 instead of seeking to inspire false fears we would prefer you speak more positively about how your own faith would guide you in leading this country

1698209 this latest product from henkel is but one more example of what ingenuity and cooperative partnership can achieve
1698210 our materials scientists working in close cooperation with mass imaging leader dek have developed a robust systems approach to deliver a complete offering that incorporates high performance manufacturable materials with a machine platform capable of ultra precise die attach deposition henkel strives to deliver risk free solutions that enable our customers competitiveness through a total process approach and this is in fact what the wbc project has achieved
1698211 current commercial ablestik wbc materials are used in production for single die configurations
1698212 however we are working on some novel application processes and have had success achieving coatings that are less than 10 microns thick it is certainly conceivable that our wbc technology will quickly become an alternative to film for stacked die applications as well

1698224 to you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to the rest it is in parables so that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand
1698225 a moneylender had two debtors one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty
1698226 you gave me no water for my feet but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair you gave me no kiss but she since the time i came in has not ceased to kiss my feet you did not anoint my head with oil but she anointed my feet with perfume
1698227 for this reason i say to you her sins which are many have been forgiven for she loved much but he who is forgiven little loves little
1698228 there was a rich man who had a manager and this manager was reported to him as squandering his possessions
1698229 and i say to you make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness so that when it fails they will receive you into the eternal dwellings he who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth who will entrust the true riches to you
1698230 you are my friends if you do what i command you
1698231 i praise you o father lord of heaven and earth that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants
1698232 blessed are the eyes which see the things you see
1698233 what is written in the law how does it read to you
1698234 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself
1698235 you have answered correctly do this and you will live
1698236 which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers hands
1698237 how can i be a friend to those who are in need
1698238 you have faith and i have works show me your faith without the works and i will show you my faith by my works
1698239 sons of our father who is in heaven for he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous
1698240 began to grumble saying this man receives sinners and eats with them
1698241 he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine
1698242 and he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating and no one was giving anything to him
1698243 i will get up and go to my father and will say to him
1698244 felt compassion for him and ran and embraced him and kissed him
1698245 quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet and bring the fattened calf kill it and let us eat and celebrate for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again he was lost and has been found
1698246 for this brother of yours was dead and has begun to live and was lost and has been found
1698247 i tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine righteous persons who need no repentance
1698248 tied up heavy burdens and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves were unwilling to move them with so much as a finger
1698249 was telling them a parable the unjust judge to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart
1698250 will not god bring about justice for his elect who cry to him day and night and will he delay long over them i tell you that he will bring about justice for them quickly
1698251 while i was fainting away i remembered the lord and my prayer came to you into your holy temple
1698252 deliver me i pray you from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he come and smite us all the mothers with the children
1698253 granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god
1698254 i believe there should be no censorship but if someone publishes something which for example incites law breaking or violence they should be punished through the courts it is illogical to say people are law breakers before they speak let them speak first and then be responsible before the law this is the only logical approach
1698255 the state committee has always refused to tell people which literature is banned
1698256 freedom of information i everyone is free to look for acquire transfer prepare and distribute information ii freedom of mass media is guaranteed state censorship in mass media including press is prohibited
1698257 either we have censorship in which case there should be a law or we dont
1698258 i believe there should be no censorship but if someone publishes something which for example incites law breaking or violence they should be punished through the courts it is illogical to say people are law breakers before they speak let them speak first and then be responsible before the law this is the only logical approach
1698259 ive seen some texts that say it is halal permissible to kill non muslims or muslims who dont believe correctly
1698260 but the police or the national security ministry nsm secret police should be the ones who should identify the publishers of such bad literature
1698261 take control of the production import and distribution of religious literature items other religious informational materials and give its consent on the bases of the appeals of the religious institutions and relevant state bodies in accordance with the established procedure
1698262 people also have to trust those doing the expert analysis
1698263 i dont trust the state committee for work with religious organisations
1698264 from my perspective punishment for an offence such as confiscation of books is only lawful by decision of a court a court should decide this not officials
1698265 the possibility has to be there to challenge the decisions of any executive body
1698266 in court there is the possibility of comparing decisions openly this is the civilised way
1698267 there are youth who read and follow these ideas if we allowed publications freely thered be anarchy books have influence
1698268 if a book is connected with religion the printer will ask to see permission in writing from the state committee including the number of copies they are allowing to be printed
1698269 we have the desire to print literature here but it demands a lot of energy and money
1698270 whether or not there is permission from the state committee
1698271 we have to observe some formalities over publishing bulletins and importing books but there are no basic problems now
1698272 we had to give it to our brothers in dagestan
1698273 we can bring in only two or three christian books
1698274 if there werent such restrictions we could bring in what we like
1698275 in general any censorship of religious literature would be a violation of osce commitments
1698276 16 in order to ensure the freedom of the individual to profess and practice religion or belief the participating states will inter alia
1698277 in about 2005 one devotee had about 25 books confiscated by azerbaijani customs when they were returning by train from russia through dagestan officers said this is a religious book and of a different faith
1698278 if its 50 or so copies many wont accept it either because they are muslims or because they are afraid of the police
1698279 the shop doesnt need permission from the state committee to sell books
1698280 but they keep a close watch to check that they dont sell banned literature
1698281 each title and the quantity we want to import needs to be approved
1698282 this also applies for locally produced religious books legally they should respond within one month but in practice this is often between four and six months
1698283 how can you get examples in to the country for the committee to approve if you cant legally import them without permission
1698284 web 2 0 but the upkeep of this has been a pain and demotivating to write anything new every wordpress phpbb forum updates are extremely tedious due to some theme compatibility issues im having now
1698285 everyone knows that stuff already they just dont do it
1698286 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
1698287 mr clement has never clearly stated why the government supports needle exchange and rehab programs but so sternly opposes the existence of a facility where drug users can actually use the safe needles and be encouraged to enter rehab the sticking point appears to be that at insite drug users cannot be arrested and prosecuted
1698288 drug users because they are often marginalized and treated as criminals are among the least likely people with hiv aids to get treatment and among the most likely to infect others making them the focus of much research
1698289 which is always said with flippant arrogance masquerading as either city slicker inadequacy or self effacing ambivalence

1698314 people dont starve in this country its ok compared with other countries here you dont go hungry because you can just go and get money for free
1698315 say 3 000 a month in their hands and theyre somewhere miles up north theyre not going to earn that sort of money so wheres the incentive for them to go out to work
1698316 single people get pregnant and get a flat and more money you just see everybody pushing prams then theyll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life

1698327 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1698328 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1698329 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1698330 a change in attitude is not the same thing as a change in behaviour but attitudes do matter
1698331 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict

1698360 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have to go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader
1698361 in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party
1698362 in labor party terms i sort of hope he does as he makes it a better pitch for us
1698363 peter costello stated his intentions at the end of last year and if he seeks to change those intentions hes entitled to do so but he can do so in his own time
1698364 as far as im aware his intentions are precisely as he stated them at the end of last year

1698383 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
1698384 the ioc never really took a clear stance and didnt really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom

1698396 i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1698397 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment in his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is
1698398 and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story
1698399 not to oppose error is to approve it and not to defend truth is to suppress it and indeed to neglect to confound evil men when we can do it is no less a sin than to encourage them
1698400 part of what has made this case more difficult is he wants to fight this but the difficulty is hes never gotten in the ring

1698409 i personally believe that u s americans are unable to do so because uh some people out there in our nation dont have maps and uh i believe that our education like such as in south africa and uh the iraq everywhere like such as and i believe that they should our education over here in the u s should help the u s er should help south africa and should help the iraq and the asian countries so we will be able to build up our future for our children

1698414 they now realise and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organising committee
1698415 it was not the most opportune time for them to wear these masks they were overly cautious
1698416 i would not wear one myself whether i was an athlete or not
1698417 the olympics have a great significance for china and to the chinese people the games will make china more open
1698418 ive been a sports enthusiast since my childhood and we were all so excited back then that china was going to become part of the olympic family again it was one of the reasons i applied to go to the beijing academy of physical science
1698419 i do not plan to come to beijing for olympics or paralympics as to what happened to me it was many years ago i am certainly very angry about it

1698433 i never said we were pen pals i was merely trying to communicate how excited i was that obama has such a hands on approach with his supporters which was unfortunately exploited in a silly media frenzy
1698434 is still on the tip of everyones tongue but now instead of folks breathlessly asking each other if theyd seen it talk has turned to speculation over ivillage is reporting that the caped crusader may take on the

1698441 the academic records of the presidential candidates are clear magna cum laude harvard univ law school vs 894 of 899 us naval academy interesting facts this is one of those situations where most right wing conservatives will ignore facts and just support mccain if the shoe were on the other foot we all know they would be bashing obama sources see link below senator john mccain graduated 894th out of 899 in his class at the u s naval academy in 1958 yet ive not seen this in any major media i wonder if this would be the case if the roles were reversed and that unimpressive rank had been senator barack obamas class ranking and senator mccain had graduated magna cum laude from harvard law school and been president of the harvard law review as did senator obama

1698444 if you look at it from public finance weve put 500m into elite sports and what weve got to try and do is make sure theres a recovery of that in terms of the outcomes
1698445 it wasnt a target that we put to uk sport uk sport themselves decided thats what we should expect from the amount of investment thats gone in
1698446 i think people have recognised the amount of investment that has gone into sport over the last 10 years but they will certainly measure that by outcomes and thats why these games will be important because weve handed the opportunity to give the athletes time to train
1698447 we have to move forward we have a well financed and well organised elite system and we have to look at improving i would think it unacceptable if we didnt move forward
1698448 its an amazing olympic village and certainly raises the bar for future organising committees
1698449 we remind them that they are joining a very exclusive club
1698450 since the modern games began only 6 519 people have represented great britain money cant buy a place in it
1698451 if you can bring these young hopefuls here and allow them to become immersed in the games and see what it takes to win medals then i think that will be very helpful for them in the future
1698452 the challenge is to make sure there is more competition between athletes than between chemists laboratories

1698459 the youth workers were already in post and had good local relationships with the young people
1698460 also each of the area projects was already working with a steering group made up of local community representatives who ensure they are targeting the young people that need the help most
1698461 the outreach officers have been able to deliver a range of activities which have encouraged the young people they deal with to make informed decisions about nuisance behaviour in turn preventing its escalation to more serious anti social and criminal behaviour
1698462 this work has brought big but localised improvement across the city as a result the belfast community safety partnership intend to continue its relationship with the area youth projects and plans are currently in the pipeline to put in place a small team of roaming youth workers who will move around the city to support the area projects when needed
1698463 the money has been able to do a lot we have been able to run a lot of different initiatives and community saftey programmes with young people
1698464 one programme was directed towards the safety of young women walking home we were able to run a self defence programme which taught them how to protect themselves if they were attacked and sensible things like walking where there is street lighting
1698465 there was always a bit of trouble in the parks in east so we wanted to get the kids involved to make them aware of their responsibilities to their communities it was about them staying safe getting involved in their environment but knowing they had responsibilities to their communities it was a cross community project involving kids from the short strand and wider protestant community
1698466 many of the young people involved in that project were known to the police but things have now got a lot better up there they have a bit of pride in their community it the anti social behaviour is no way near at the level it was like
1698467 its great that we have an opportunity to get this quality of coaching for the young people of our local communities in north belfast
1698468 coerver is internationally recognised as one of the pre eminent coaching methods used by professional clubs including manchester united and arsenal
1698469 their commitment in providing this fun day is to be welcomed and we hope it will be the start of more coaching days in the waterworks facility
1698470 at last the westland and the waterworks area is in the news for positive reasons and we hope to use this event as a springboard for further coaching initiatives that both communities can engage with and enjoy
1698471 this is merely the start of a series of events to address the anti social and recreational rioting problems that have blighted north belfast for too long
1698472 i hope that all groups can work together with football as the catalyst for creating better relationships and communication channels between those most affected by disturbances in the waterworks hopefully making trouble a thing of the past
1698473 the south belfast area project works in a number of communities across the area offering young people aged from 12 25 the opportunity to participate in a range of personal and social development programmes
1698474 with the help of belfast community safety partnership we have been able to run numerous successful youth outreach programmes including a cross cultural programme bringing together young people from the chinese welfare association arts ekta finaghy youth centre and the south belfast area project to examine their values and beliefs and develop a greater understanding of other cultures the finaghy citizenship project which offered young people from the area the opportunity to look at the issue of active citizenship through learning how to lobby politicians and several personal development programmes
1698475 the young people involved have gained increased levels of confidence and self awareness a greater understanding of a range of cultures and beliefs and increased awareness of citizenship and public safety issues
1698476 it has enabled the south belfast area project to offer additional programmes to help meet the needs of a range of young people including those who did not previously avail of any youth provision this is a positive example of partnerships working together
1698477 the money we received was a great boost in tackling anti social behaviour in west belfast
1698478 there can be so much bad press surrounding the area that it was great to put together events celebrating all that is good in our society it certainly went a long way to enhance and reverse the opinions of west belfast
1698479 one of the events we organised was a health day which took place at corpus christi college
1698480 this gave young people in the area the chance to speak to professionals and gain information concerning alcohol and drug awareness sexual health relationships and eating disorders
1698481 the young people could also try out some alternative therapies including indian head massage and back and shoulder massage
1698482 we organised a talent competition which will run through different stages and will hopefully give young people something to work on
1698483 we have already held the first heat and it was very popular with the young people
1698484 the money we received helped us organise different activities and we are looking forward to the end of august when we will be taking a group of young women on a residential this will involve team building and games
1698485 our ability to secure new business in mexico has been significantly enhanced by this new association with energy marine services discussions are currently underway with several major oil and coal fired power plants that are experiencing severe slagging and so

1698489 he was a normal happy kid they dont have the right to take his life away we acknowledged that he committed a crime but make him pay with a life sentence
1698490 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1698491 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1698492 certainly the olympic games are about the athletes the active athletes who are competing
1698493 he is a normal citizen in this case and any citizen has to apply for a visa its a matter for the chinese government
1698494 visa application processes for any country are done by governments the ioc is not a sovereign government we cannot influence sovereign laws
1698495 but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
1698496 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1698497 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1698498 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1698499 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1698500 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1698501 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1698502 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1698503 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1698504 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1698505 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened

1698508 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1698509 obama himself never suggested that the clintons had harbored racial animus though his campaign did at least once make that case to the media and some of his supporters overtly denounced the former president
1698510 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
1698511 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
1698512 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel

1698520 a paper for the minister of enterprise was supposed to be discussed at the executive on july 24 and the last time the executive met was on june 19 and now it is tabled for september 18 three months will have elapsed and we have a very tight deadline of 2012 to have it finished
1698521 an alternative proposal from the odyssey has been put forward but it clearly hasnt been discussed by the executive
1698522 the odyssey proposal hasnt got planning permission which is a major drawback it is very far behind they have some good ideas especially given they pulled the proposals together in just a number of weeks but time is a problem and a big reality is it would be very very hard to make work
1698523 but because of the executive not meeting for three months no decision has been reached on the other project the go ahead could have already been given
1698524 when i was enterprise minister we were talking of doing something at that stage virtually every major country there is has some reference to the titanic while we are sticking out like a sore toe theres nothing but a dry dock and a bit of the slipway the titanic is a worldwide brand and it is not being exploited we have nothing now and a museum is essential we need to get something

1698529 this is very good news at a time when confidence in the uk economy is not high and the companys management are to be congratulated for their business vision and bucking the current economic trend i hope this investment will encourage other firms considering business ventures or expansion
1698530 the firms past successes are a tribute to the current highly skilled and motivated employees and they deserve to be applauded for their successful track record
1698531 this investment is assisting crane stockham valve to improve its competitiveness and profitability add value to its business and increase export sales by developing the skills levels of its staff even more

1698533 this has been an outstanding initiative which has given all the boys involved with the team the opportunity to see america and develop new friendships
1698534 all the lads and the adults involved in the project have developed a strong bond over the past year and it has been an excellent educational experience for all of us
1698535 the lads gelled really well and hurled brilliantly they were excellent and they deserved to win it the whole spirit of the venture was beyond my expectation and the fact that we won was the icing on the cake
1698536 today marks another important step forward for the executive we have said since the restoration of devolution that we would make victims and survivors a priority for this administration
1698537 we hope that this document will help to move us on the road to making a real difference to the lives of those who have been most affected by the events here over the last 40 years
1698538 we want to ensure that future support and services are shaped by victims and survivors it is important that everyone with an interest in victims and survivors issues read this draft document carefully and gives us their views
1698539 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1698540 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1698541 aafia was tortured for five years until one day the us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1698542 dr aafias case is a reminder of the grave injustice done to god knows how many pakistanis in us detention facilities in bagram in afghanistan guantanamo bay and elsewhere who have been listed as missing
1698543 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government asks authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice

1698555 de inflatie is hoog gedreven door de eerdere verhoging van de prijzen van energie en andere grondstoffen
1698556 uit voorbeelden in de verenigde staten blijkt dat de prijzen dan kunnen stijgen
1698557 het is een logische vervolgstap op het openstellen van adsl en telefoonlijnen van kpn de tv kijker heeft als voordeel dat de prijzen zullen dalen en dat de diensten beter worden

1698559 residents in the area have spotted 20 30 pigeons over the past two months with one of these darts sticking out of their legs
1698560 then on the twelfth week i found my cat titch had been wounded by one of the darts but thankfully she is fine now when i found one of the darts lying out on the street last thursday july 31 i got in contact with the police as now i had proof that these attacks were taking place
1698561 the policewoman told me the dart came from a dangerous weapon and that it had to be taken away for analysis but ive heard nothing since
1698562 we residents are worried that if whoever is doing this is now starting to target pets as well as pigeons then its only a matter of time before they move on to humans
1698563 this is something weve been calling for for some time as these weapons are becoming more and more sophisticated
1698564 they kill hundreds of animals across northern ireland each year we have seen pet dogs die of blood poisoning from the pellets lodged in them from these guns that owners are unable to spot
1698565 police attended the scene no formal complaint was made however an item was removed for further examination
1698566 reste savoir si elle le sera nouveau cette ann e tandis que la quatri me saison de
1698567 it was a big decision for the coach to make but he gets paid to make tough decisions and thankfully it paid off and we qualified that decision just shows you how seriously we take this
1698568 poznan was the most nerve wracking event ive been involved in and ive been involved in olympic and world finals
1698569 we couldnt afford to peak because we had to peak at beijing so we had to hold back but do enough to get through so it was very tough and such a relief to make it
1698570 ive been rooming with paul griffin for nine to ten years so you learn when to give each other space and when to chat but you can get on each others nerves at times because youre living out of each others pockets
1698571 but were an experienced crew and thankfully cathal has settled in well he has the right attitude hes very determined and its been good because hes brought a fresh pair of eyes to the boat
1698572 ive been sixth in an olympic final and im going there this time to get gold a medal is all im interested in im not just going to wear the blazer
1698573 its going to be very close because at last years world championships there was only four seconds between the top boats
1698574 i suppose the favourites have to be the world champions britain denmark are double olympic champions and french and china were world champions in 2005 and 2006 but we are ready to go and get a medal
1698575 its funny because half the british boat is irish richard is there and james lindsay fynn is from meath
1698576 as far as im concerned when we get into the water were just focused on beating the other boats around us
1698577 i dont like to look too far ahead i just treat this like a job and with this job comes pain but im used to it pain is good london would be great but im just focused on beijing
1698578 after athens i went back to finish my architecture degree and then back to rowing so you just dont know
1698579 we go to beijing believing we can do it and all the hard winter work is behind us so when were short on oxygen and the lactate acid is building up in our legs well keep going and hopefully well get that medal
1698580 we are still working on a budget for the rally but im determined to be there
1698581 i want to show mitsubishi what i am capable of
1698582 im not a crasher by reputation as my six wins in the evo challenge last season prove but these things happen in rallying it is the nature of the sport
1698583 it was devastating to be dropped by the team after working so hard over the past four years to earn the works drive i dont know what the future holds for me but for the moment im just focusing on putting the pieces together to allow me to do the ulster rally
1698584 to test yourself against the best teams in the world is what the world cup is all about and they dont come any bigger than india the world twenty20 champions
1698585 bangladesh is the closest team to us on a level playing field and will be tough opposition as we saw when we went over there and played them in their own back yard in march but twenty20 is a completely different format of the game the conditions in england should suit us better and were looking forward to it
1698586 our performance in barbados that day with bat ball and in the field was one of the best we have ever put together and thats what we are going to have to do next year if we are to compete
1698587 we were invited to put ourselves forward for this competition by conservative government ministers who had become aware of our group through an event in the spectrum centre
1698588 we were encouraged to enter the csj awards as they thought it was relevant to the work we do
1698589 as part of the assessment csj sent an assessor to the centre in april to see the work being carried out
1698590 as a group we were really pleased to have made it as far as we did we were up against some very impressive projects
1698591 we had ambitions about a larger summer project the interest in the halloween project consolidated this idea
1698592 the celts were a diverse group of tribal societies that we all both catholic and protestant are descendants from this is something that unites us although it is often overlooked
1698593 heck it would be great to have an olympic medal
1698594 winning olympic gold would be great for both me and my country
1698595 it would be something always to have with pride but no not as important as winning a slam event for a tennis player that always has to be the supreme achievement
1698596 we are delighted to have both alan and mark on board with ireland both of them are extremely strong technical coaches in their areas and i think they will bring a further positive mix to the coaching team and squad
1698597 alan brings with him experience of both international and most importantly irish rugby mark is recognised as one of the top kicking coaches in the world and his experience of working with the squad in the past will help with the transition over the next number of weeks
1698598 if this threat to traffic attendants is real it should be immediately withdrawn
1698599 traffic attendants are ordinary working men and women providing a vital service in west belfast and in towns and cities throughout this island
1698600 the attendants should be able to carry out their work without threats or the fear of attack
1698601 we cant allow another generation of self appointed heroes to tell us what to do or how we organise the free flow of traffic or any other public service the traffic wardens are public servants working on our behalf they deserve and must get the full protection of a democratic society
1698602 i would venture to say that the movement supporting barack obama is like nothing i have experienced since the robert kennedy campaign of 1968
1698603 obamas roots are in the immigrant experience and the community organising tradition
1698604 i am aware that historically there have been some concerns about the development of restorative justice schemes in both nationalist and loyalist communities that is why we spent some considerable time developing a rigorous protocol to establish working relationships with statutory agencies in particular we have underlined the pivotal role for the police and provided stringent safeguards to protect the rights of both victims and offenders
1698605 i have carefully examined all the relevant information on these schemes and share the view expressed by the chief inspector of criminal justice that there is no cause for concern in the way that community restorative justice schemes now operate
1698606 i believe that community based restorative justice schemes can have a full role to play in helping to resolve the sort of low level crime that causes tensions and difficulties in many local communities
1698607 i was at the first f ile 20 years ago and have always been a part of it
1698608 f ile is a creative and dynamic way to showcase the good work in west belfast

1698625 and whats more you can even map subdomains so lets say you work at deakin university you can get your tech people to set the a record on james deakin edu au to 72 34 61 230 and youll be away
1698626 im a bit confused about the subdomains bit the explanation for which is a bit terse to say the least
1698627 now my question i have already set up a blog when i map it to my existing domain what happens to my permalinks that have been bookmarked or to trackbacks and pings
1698628 do you have the capability to point multiple domain names to the blog
1698629 also what happens to those people who already point to the feed that i have created
1698630 also if i am purchasing the domain from you i am assuming that i own the rights to that domain and can move it to another location in the future if i wish to do so correct
1698631 i would like to see some direction for how to keep the domain name showing in the address bar the domain maps correctly to my blog but then the blog url appears in the address bar do i need to have it mapped to a subdomain to keep the address showing i ask because right now my blog is the front face of my domain but i later plan to add more pages and have the blog show up as blog bmharvey com
1698632 hopefully improved with lovely fresh water and looking absolutely pristine
1698633 its my view that we will see a recovery and if we can get a fresh water solution now we will see a fresh water system in years to come
1698634 if they believe the nuclear issue was enough to go to the federal court then why wasnt this one
1698635 there is going to be a major disaster in the area if they dont do something about it
1698636 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes
1698637 even if we did make a decision to not give any allocations upstream there is insufficient water currently in storage less the critical human needs issue for us to viably manage the lower lakes with the amount of water that we have
1698638 that is extremely unfortunate and extremely difficult for the community down there
1698639 medical sources as saying the diagnosis was made in april
1698640 medical matters are personal and private we are not putting out a statement the prince continues with his engagements as normal said a royal spokeswoman
1698641 its become an open secret within the medical community that philip has prostate cancer
1698642 if hed had a serious chest infection that was so worrying it required hospitalisation he wouldnt have walked in and out of there smiling and been sitting up in bed replying to letters added the unnamed specialist
1698643 this exercise might make the government feel good but it does nothing for consumers or the issue of competition in the market
1698644 there is no reason that the supermarkets could not have realtime pricing on the internet because they change their prices every day and these are all on their computers
1698645 this grocery watch or grocery choice wont take into account any specials wont take into account multiple purchases its a scheme based on prices a month old and thats why it wont work
1698646 cocoa is always jumping into the river there as she loves the water
1698647 i took the lead off her and she jumped in after a duck but she got her neck trapped in some mesh wire and rope that was in the river
1698648 i started to panic and called for help as cocoa was in great distress
1698649 by this stage cocoa was starting to go under and a crowd had gathered at the riverbank
1698650 i helped him the good samaritan out of the water but did not get a chance to thank him properly for what he did as he was dripping wet and had to run home
1698651 i just want to thank him for his valiant efforts in saving cocoa because if he had not of jumped in she might have drowned
1698652 it makes you think how safe the river is for animals and what would happen if a person fell in
1698653 the river lagan is a designated watercourse within the terms of the drainage northern ireland order 1973 and therefore is maintained by rivers agency as necessary to ensure free flow
1698654 the rivers agency however only maintains an interest in the flow control structures of the river lagan and is not involved in debris removal unless it constitutes a drainage risk or impediment to flow
1698655 they worked harder than ever before and rose to the occasion delivering truly memorable performances
1698656 tribute to their outstanding choral work and the commitment of everyone involved
1698657 the choir is a shining example of how the arts can be accessible to all groups in society
1698658 we would like to wish them every success in the future
1698659 the central and crucial point in this debate is that the dup will not agree to the devolution of policing and justice powers to the northern ireland assembly until such times as there is sufficient community confidence to allow it to occur
1698660 successive governments have encouraged sinn fein to think that unreasonable demands by them will be met if the demands are repeated often enough
1698661 it now appears that sinn fein think we in the dup are not prepared to continue confronting this nonsense they seem to think a snap assembly election is something we do not want
1698662 i and my colleagues are already in pre election mode having canvassed thousands of homes in our constituencies in recent weeks
1698663 this will prove invaluable if an election is brought about in the autumn it is difficult to see what anyone thinks will change after any election but if that is what is required for sinn fein to see that the days of their demands being followed by delivery from others is over then it will have been a price worth paying
1698664 engage properly on important issues like education the environment the irish language and of course policing powers
1698665 our eye firmly fixed on our political goals as we continue to negotiate with the dup and the two governments on all of these issues
1698666 a 36 year old man has been arrested in donegal in connection with the investigation into the murder of jean quigley in derry on saturday july 26

1698671 she was a delightful beautiful child and everyone loved her she filled our summers with joy as a young adult jean came to visit us just last summer and the glorious child we knew had matured and developed into a gorgeous kind thoughtful young woman
1698672 she had a delightful sense of humour and a smile that would melt a glacier

1698676 but we had a bit of banter about it and it went from there
1698677 there were ipswich shirts all over the place so i had to change that
1698678 people were shouting from the flats near the ground and couldnt believe it
1698679 its a shock because you think twins oh my gosh what are we going to do with them

1698689 messi will play the whole olympic games for argentina he will stay for the whole tournament
1698690 they felt with the olympics about to open and the chinese governments ongoing crackdown on tibet that it was really important to make the statement at this time sort of a peaceful but bold statement to show solidarity for tibetans
1698691 this not how the things were understood and planned if we can be assured it is for crowd management then possibly it could be acceptable for us
1698692 well these 20 per cent enable us to be at the table if a consolidationincluding mol should really come along
1698693 given the indication from the european commission that it would not accept our remedy proposal omvs board has concluded that such a merger would not fulfil our standards

1698710 i lived all my childhood in the countryside taking care of my goats my family forced me to get married to a person whom i did not love they did that in order to help my older brother to get married to a girl of that family
1698711 everyone can make a difference in the lives of our less fortunate and impoverished communities we have come to help improve the lives of those south africans who are still living below the poverty line
1698712 we strongly believe that poverty is not inevitable we believe it is a social injustice which can be tackled

1698718 i am grateful to be part of this team which is making a difference in communities

1698723 we have had successes with the partnerships against hiv as well as tuberculosis and this has given us the courage to approach international donors for support

1698770 a neo colonial label for music not sung in english
1698771 thinking about how we listen to music today i wondered why it is that ringtones have so far been treated as unfit for creative music who says ringtones have to be bad its like saying lps or cds are bad its just a medium

1698773 the mandela bay development agency mbda established as the development arm of the municipality with a specific mandate to facilitate tourism and infrastructure development advertised a request for proposal rfp in april 2008
1698774 the municipality is calling for dynamic professional and multi disciplinary stadium operators to operate the new multi purpose stadium in nelson mandela bay which will be completed in march 2009
1698775 the mbda and municipality will shortly commence evaluating the bids submitted and individual briefing sessions will be held with each bidder from september 2008 onwards
1698776 it is anticipated that the final preferred bidder will be selected towards the end of 2008 and the municipality aims to sign a management contract with the preferred bidder in the first quarter of 2009
1698777 nelson mandela bay is the first host city to have made significant progress in the appointment of a stadium operator for not only the 2010 fifa world cup but also from a future legacy impact point of view
1698778 although nelson mandela bay is well geared to host a successful 2010 world cup tournament in nelson mandela bay it is also of vital importance that an operator is appointed to ensure that the stadium is a prominent contributor to the growth of the municipality
1698779 we acknowledge the progress that has been made on the nelson mandela bay stadium in recent months
1698780 with the complex nature of the construction and erection of the roof of the stadium however it was decided that it would be too high a risk to keep the stadium in the fifa confederations cup schedule
1698781 many first year students struggle to adjust to academic language and to cope with the high level demand of independent research and self directed learning
1698782 few schools alert learners to the changed learning context of university and for many first years university is a deep culture shock

1698784 forcing policy development that interferes with food production in australia
1698785 most of the time farmers are price takers not price makers however if the cost of production is too great then we are facing a situation that it will become unviable for some farmers to continue while farmers must be able to increase production levels over the next 10 years to meet predicted demands we also need to balance the issue of reduced carbon emissions we need research and development programs to find new technologies to allow farmers to face the challenges before them agriculture in this country can have a bright future but if costly community demand continues then it must take responsibility for finding a viable way forward for food production

1698797 does it not help the firm it doesnt hurt the firm
1698798 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends

1698814 senator mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists and its no wonder because many of his top advisors are former oil and gas lobbyists
1698815 the price he paid for his partys nomination was to reverse himself on position after position and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick

1698849 in addition abuses of migrant construction workers who were pivotal to beijings infrastructure improvements have increased as have evictions of beijing residents whose homes were demolished to make way for that infrastructure
1698850 those abuses reflect both the chinese governments wholesale failure to honor its olympics related human rights promises as well as the negligence of the international olympic committee in ensuring that china fulfills its commitments
1698851 instead the beijing games have prompted a rollback in some of the most basic rights enshrined in chinas constitution and international law
1698852 too late sudan could have moved to prosecute war criminals a long time ago
1698853 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs
1698854 we are not getting gas that starts out as 87 89 or 92 octane it is obviously bad for the consumer who doesnt know any better
1698855 i had an interesting conversation with ron lamberty vp american coalition for ethanol yesterday he informed me that in many cases the oil companies are blending the ethanol with gas that is 85 or even 83 ron we are not getting gas that starts out as 87 89 or 92 ron and then ethanol added which we know should improve performance this would explain why motorists are reporting a greater than expected loss in mpgs especially at e85 while this is clearly a way for the oil companies to cut corners and make more money it is obviously bad for the consumer who doesnt know any better
1698856 you know i think it was the lady who does my hair that said it first
1698857 corn farmers and ethanol producers know they are running a cruel hoax on the american consumer
1698858 ethanol is so costly that it wouldnt make it in a free market
1698859 so despite what you may have read recently about food versus fuel hype the evidence on the ground in the magic valley is that we can efficiently produce both f
1698860 is it logical or even acceptable that agricultural crops are used to produce ethanol

1698867 china is one of londons fastest growing visitor markets despite economic uncertainty throughout much of the world new results show that chinese visitors to london increased by 26 per cent to 82 000 in 2007 and this number is set to rise to 350 000 by 2012
1698868 visit london will be focusing on how we can translate the excitement of the chinese over their own games to londons in 2012
1698869 the forecast incremental tourism benefit of the london 2012 games is 2 2 billion for london alone emerging markets such as china will be critical to delivering this success
1698870 independent research shows that increases in visits from our traditional markets such as the us and europe are likely to be outpaced by those from the rapidly emerging economies of the world china alone is estimated to have 100 million outbound tourists by 2020 and visit london aims to ensure that our capital is the destination of choice for these travellers
1698871 it would appear the woman had spoken to the men about smoking earlier this week this morning when she was at the station she was walking past the same men when one them pushed her and she fell onto the track
1698872 she suffered a fractured wrist and bruising to her legs she was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been released
1698873 the woman was very lucky she was not more seriously injured the third rail carries 750 volts of electricity and she could have been electrocuted or even struck by an early morning train
1698874 there is absolutely no sense in londoners paying 18m from their already stretched transport budget in order to reduce capacity on londons roads this scheme would have turned a green glade of heroes into a vast blasted chewing gummed piazza
1698875 he gave me his impressions of the game so i think were getting back to normal
1698876 i think he was pleased with the way the offense moved the ball and disappointed we didnt score more touchdowns in the red zone thats something weve been working on
1698877 i think he was like all of us and felt like we had some things we could build on hes getting the practice tapes and getting transcripts
1698878 he knows whats going on at every practice hes doing fine
1698879 he said good job and keep going he was proud of me when youre him and you do things as close to perfect as you possibly can all the time you have the right to critique everybody else
1698880 he manning is like he always is its no different for him than if he was actually out there thats what makes him good hes analyzing every practice everything we do hes putting himself in position so when he does come back it wont be like hes been totally away from it
1698881 he has been away from it physically but mentally hes going through every practice
1698882 well find out a little more tomorrow night where he is
1698883 those were three we werent really expecting after the game but nothing that seems like its going to be too major

1699097 just wanted to say thank you for the invitation to the show it was absolutely top notch the set the music the commentary all of it true avenue style
1699098 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1699099 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1699100 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1699101 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand
1699102 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1699103 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1699104 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1699105 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1699106 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1699107 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together
1699108 this is the mother lode all right from the point of view of internet criminals looking for easier access to other peoples money and secrets
1699109 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1699110 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1699111 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1699112 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1699113 its so shocking being an american to see the blatant oppression
1699114 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1699115 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1699116 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1699117 i am aware of the fact that not every resolution is implemented i am aware of the difficulties and despite all this i say with complete confidence that the security council resolution is good for israel
1699118 it is important to state that from the beginning when we understood that in fact these goals had to be achieved by political means and because it was obvious to us that the entire international community understood the cause of the recent incidents and that it was necessary to implement resolution 1559 we ourselves acted to initiate the procedures and resolutions that would promote the goals we had set ourselves
1699119 and assuming that it is implemented compared with the situation that existed before could create a dramatic change in southern lebanon
1699120 even in the last hours before passage of the resolution we wanted to ensure that this embargo would be enforceable and substantive preventing the transfer of arms from these countries to hizbullah in fact to anyone other than the lebanese army now the embargo is part of the un resolution and the terms and formulation of this article are acceptable to israel and express our opinion a proper embargo
1699121 and it is important to say that one way or the other responsibility has been imposed on the lebanese government to ensure that arms do not enter in order to prevent the rearming of hizbullah
1699122 the question has been asked about whether everything is now dependent on decisions or requests from the lebanese government with regard to the international forces from our standpoint any entire process that involves placing power in the hands of the lebanese government so that it can enforce its sovereignty is a positive one which of course creates a genuine change in the situation in lebanon
1699123 regarding the international force should it become apparent that the forces that were decided upon are not adequate the resolution opens the way that will allow for improving the mandate and creating a proper force so that it will be more effective with a broader mandate than this one this is already determined in the resolution
1699124 israel of course demanded that the kidnapped soldiers be returned to their families as this was and still is our goal
1699125 in my estimation especially due to the events of the past month the international community as well as the lebanese government understands that israel will no longer accept a situation whereby a terrorist organization sits on its border and fires katyushas at israeli citizens or alternatively attacks israeli soldiers whenever it wants to so as i stated earlier in comparing the political situation on the day before and the chance that this resolution will change the situation in lebanon with the goals we set for ourselves here two days after the beginning of the conflict and what we hope to achieve following termination of the military operation without addressing the question of when and how it will end we have attained most of the goals in the israeli initiative which in effect we placed as the first draft on the table of the international community
1699126 webbs breakthrough ideas show how marketing selling and servicing functions can be approached as a process with input and outputs causes and effects i highly recommend this book to all senior executives whether they are aiming for better forecasting better market share higher margins or reduced cost of sales it will completely change the way you view sales and marketing and help you get a handle on sales process improvement

1699146 made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
1699147 behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high as many were astonied at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men so shall he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors
1699148 you kind of hope it didnt happen because it ends up being someone getting what they wanted after doing every possible thing ethically they could do wrong
1699149 i was in that clubhouse after that and the change in atmosphere was palpable and i dont think you can put a price tag on that

1699153 grave sforzarsi di essere uguali provoca nevrosi psicosi paranoie grave voler essere uguali perch questo significa forzare la natura significa andare contro le leggi di dio che in tutti i boschi del mondo non ha creato una sola foglia identica allaltra ma tu ritieni che lessere diverso sia follia e cos hai scelto di vivere in questo ospedale psichiatrico perch qui visto che tutti sono diversi diventi uguale agli altri

1699184 i have no idea how can i train in such conditions and who would clean the discus after every throw
1699185 the 2008 farm bill generally continues the farm commodity price and income support framework of the 2002 farm bill with modifications it continues the direct payment counter cyclical payment and marketing loan programs for the 2008 2012 crop years but adjusts target prices and loan rates for some commodities the law also creates a pilot revenue based counter cyclical program acre beginning with the 2009 crop year the new law also has a pilot program for planting flexibility new restrictions on base acres developed for residential use and elimination of benefits to farms with fewer than 10 acres of program crops for the 2008 crop year the programs are essentially unchanged from the 2002 farm bill
1699186 if market prices are expected to be high acre might be preferred by many farmers because the traditional counter cyclical payments would be zero or small even under high prices acre may help farmers manage downside systemic risks that is manage the risks that are inherent in the market and cannot be diversified away and as market price falls acre may make payments when traditional counter cyclical programs would not acre is expected to perform better than traditional counter cyclical programs under high price environments in states with larger yield increase since the 1980s in states with more variable yields and in states that are outside the primary growing regions of a particular commodity
1699187 to receive an acre payment two triggers need to be met
1699188 the second trigger keeps farms from receiving payments when they did not have a sufficient loss even if the state as a whole sustained a loss in revenue for the crop
1699189 the state level revenue guarantee amount and the individual farm benchmark revenue are determined by the product of a guaranteed price with a guaranteed level of production benchmark or guaranteed yields at the state and farm levels are
1699190 if both triggers are met an individual farm will receive an acre payment that is based on the state level difference between actual revenue and the acre guarantee per acre multiplied by a percentage 83 3 in crop years 2009 2011 or 85 in crop year 2012 of the farms planted acreage but pro rated based on the individual farms yield history compared to the states yield history the maximum payment rate is 25 of the acre guarantee
1699191 the administration has criticized the acre program because its two year price guarantee feature will incorporate the historically high recent market prices into the guarantee and consequently allow possibly large payments to farmers if market prices decline from their currently record high levels the administration has argued that the congressional budget office cbo score of this program for purposes of estimating budgetary impacts of the legislation does not reflect the magnitude of this possibility because market prices in the baseline are expected to remain high
1699192 as described previously under the direct payment program farmers may plant crops other than the program crop and still receive direct payments this is known as planting flexibility
1699193 the restriction on planting fruits and vegetables is a seemingly reasonable response to protect growers of unsubsidized fruits and vegetables who do not want competition from subsidized growers of program crops the planting restriction on fruits and vegetables however decoupled or green box for wto accounting the wto has determined that the restrictions are inconsistent with the rules of a minimally distorting subsidy
1699194 the 2008 farm bill creates a pilot planting flexibility program for fruits and vegetables for processing while continuing the overall restriction on planting fruits and vegetables on base acreage the pilot program begins in 2009 and allows farmers in seven midwestern states to plant base acres in cucumbers green peas lima beans pumpkins snap beans sweet corn and tomatoes grown for processing their base acres are temporarily reduced for the year resulting in lower direct and counter cyclical payments but restored for the next crop year the states include minnesota 34 000 acres wisconsin 9 000 acres michigan 9 000 acres illinois 9 000 acres indiana 9 000 acres ohio 4 000 acres and iowa 1 000 acres
1699195 brazil is prepared to hit the united states with court action over its farm subsidies following the collapse of world trade talks foreign minister celso amorim told the financial times newspaper
1699196 amorim said he was open to proposals from washington i dont have any problem if they want to offer a partial deal that puts a cap on their subsidies he said
1699197 this was in slow motion and now it will be accelerated
1699198 u s farmers could be battered with a new wave of litigation challenging generous farm subsidies as commodity prices fall and the repercussions from the collapse of the world trade talks are felt around the world
1699199 last weeks failure by world trade organization members to agree on farm trade reforms gives brazil and other agriculture exporters a new incentive to challenge u s farm programs as illegal under global trade rules
1699200 if successful they could force the united states to make cuts in its farm subsidy programs without developing countries opening their markets in return as washington has been demanding in the nearly seven year old doha trade round
1699201 the united states lost an appeal at the wto in june in its long running dispute with brazil over subsidies for cotton farmers clearing the way for brazil to seek approval for more than 1 billion a year in sanctions on u s imports canada and brazil also have filed another case which asserts that a host of u s subsidies break wto rules
1699202 after setting record highs this year corn has dropped by 25 percent during the past month and wheat has plunged by 40 percent since february
1699203 the concern among u s agricultural groups is that if commodity prices continue to fall then traditional price support mechanisms kick in and it becomes far more tempting for other countries to attack u s farm policy
1699204 certainly having weak prices any time in the future is bad news whichever way to look at it said david blandford an agricultural economist at penn state university
1699205 informa economics expects usda to forecast lower plantings however this figure is 328 million bushels above informas early july estimate corn yield is seen at 155 4 bushels per acre which would be the second highest on record if realized informa said in its crop report released tuesday morning
1699206 corn and soybean prices have declined sharply since establishing contract highs in the midst of widespread crop concerns in june and early july
1699207 the decline in prices over the past month reflects a number of shifting fundamentals including lower crude oil prices declining ethanol margins slowing corn exports increased wheat feeding and indications of some reduction in livestock production the main contributor to the price decline however was improving crop condition ratings and the resultant larger production expectations
1699208 the crop condition ratings have been reported in the current form since 1986
1699209 more modest yield forecasts are expected due to the variability and general lateness of crop development

1699211 republican presidential candidate john mccain opposes the 300 billion farm bill and subsidies for ethanol positions that both supporters and opponents say might cost him votes he needs in the upper midwest this november
1699212 his democratic rival barack obama is making a more traditional regional pitch he favors the farm bill approved by congress this year and subsidies for the midwest based ethanol industry mccain instead has promised to open new markets abroad for farmers to export their commodities
1699213 in his position papers mccain opposes farm subsidies only for those with incomes of more than 250 000 and a net worth above 2 million but hes gone further on the stump

1699220 this was a mistake the anc had made it disbanded the congress and it took over the apartheid stooges
1699221 as a political party the anc was fine and totally acceptable but to organise better the indian people needed an organisation
1699222 i wrote to mr mbeki soon after he became president in 1999 that it had been a tragedy that the anc had asked the nic to be disbanded it was an organisation that stood by the anc always

1699231 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
1699232 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
1699233 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
1699234 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

1699240 if its not joe flacco then something went wrong with the planning
1699241 it was a very traditional infrastructure outsourcing agreement we transferred our assets and our service delivery capabilities along with some of our people to ibm after the first couple of years which is usually the tough period of time for outsourcing agreement of more than 300 people and large volume work we were able to flesh it out into an environment where we were happy with the service we were receiving
1699242 the biggest change that i bring here is a mapping of the contract and its deliverables to what would be manulifes contemporary infrastructure
1699243 what i wanted to achieve in the contract is a very straightforward integration for something that was more strategically outcome based we have service level agreements and so on but im more interested in something that would address manulifes strategy
1699244 weve been a little bit behind the curve in implementing that technology
1699245 there are specific terms in the contract that benefit manulife and ibm in regards to the achievement of virtualization across our infrastructure
1699246 we will see customers for virtualization grow across the industry as cios recognize there are other ways they can virtualize their operation
1699247 owning the infrastructure ourselves does not provide strategic value to us
1699248 i dont know if i would say in the next two years that cloud computing would be something substantive enough to be part of the portfolio

1699259 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights bush said today
1699260 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers
1699261 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential he said
1699262 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1699263 human nature is universal and needs to pursue freedom and equality
1699264 one question on the minds of many here in asia and many around the world is the future direction of china bush said in thailand today
1699265 i have been fascinated by china since my first trip there in 1975 when my dad was head of the united states liaison office in beijing
1699266 over the years america has had complex relations with china he said
1699267 when i took office i was determined to set our relationship on a sturdy principled footing
1699268 we are disappointed that the doha round of trade talks has stalled and we will continue to engage china and other nations to help reach a successful conclusion
1699269 america has also established a new strategic economic dialogue with china where we discuss ways to ensure long term growth and widely shared prosperity in both our economies as well as issues like currency exchange rates and intellectual property rights the president said
1699270 through these discussions and others we are making clear to china that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa
1699271 america and china have found other key areas of cooperation
1699272 this is an important piece in the puzzle as we strive to determine if a habitable environment exists on mars
1699273 it is neither good nor bad for life it does not preclude life on mars in fact its a potential energy source
1699274 some kinds of earth life would be happy to live in these soils
1699275 perchlorate is becoming a serious threat to human health and water resources
1699276 we must be sure we have not introduced the material
1699277 i must say it seems rather remote since our fuel is hydrazine and contains no chlorine it could have migrated in the spacecraft before leaving earth but thats a low possibility
1699278 during the oven analysis they didnt look for chlorine since they were not expecting it
1699279 we dont want to come to the media and say we found chocolate on mars and then two weeks later say we were wrong its strawberry

1699291 what were trying to address is providing a unified app for simplified management of all these devices in the network infrastructure which helps customers reduce their cost of ownership
1699292 as a developer when im located in australia its often very hard to tell whether this person who sends me an e mail out of the blue has money to spend on a problem
1699293 the developer network is a perfect fit between trying to marry the open source community and the business community
1699294 them go out in the wild and try to get these applications written by some third party
1699295 a feeling of confidence that we know the customer is going to be a professional company
1699296 if someone looks at an open source project who is going to vouch for that open source project
1699297 we are right in the guts of voip networks so theres a good chance that well be part of a solution
1699298 so i guess we have to put her n the short list for mccain or barack
1699299 either one quayle added of the pig tailed appearance in which hilton melds the energy plans of both mccain and obama into one sound bite and declares the energy crisis
1699300 i mean she sort of took them both on there
1699301 i think and i hope john mccain will win the indianan said
1699302 when people go into that voting booth they know that were in unprecedented times both economically and internationally and the lack of experience of barack obama is really there
1699303 well he did beat the clintons anybody that can beat the clintons in my book is pretty good we didnt do it in 1992 i wish that we had but obama he is very effective on the
1699304 hes been able to modulate a little bit on you know iraq
1699305 when youre running for president of the united states in the primary you stake out positions and theyre pretty hard core positions quayle explained
1699306 you have certain constituencies you have to appeal to but look times change facts change new information new circumstances people that dont change their position you have to really worry about
1699307 and then you have to look at sort of the value added are you looking for somebody that has an economic background foreign policy background is it youth is it geography theres a lot of things but that loyalty of being comfortable with the vice president is very important
1699308 i think john mccain has a much easier choice here he said
1699309 i think mitt would be very good he was a good governor he knows economics hes a problem solver hes very articulate
1699310 i think this gov tim pawlenty from minnesota id put i think hes got a real shot
1699311 you have two people who are being considered to run your county head up your local school board and manage your police force based on the background and experience listed below who would you choose candidate a middle aged studied overseas attended two different colleges in the u s before getting a degree went on to get a law degree worked community affairs in his adopted home city was elected to local office served in local politics for just over six years got elected to a federal state wide office has one real year of experience in that job candidate b middle aged went to college and got a degree served in the national guard for six years became a sergeant while in the national guard earned a law degree became an investigator for a consumer protection division was elected to a federal office was re elected to a federal office was elected to a federal statewide office was re elected to a federal state wide office served in the executive branch for four years either in person or over the phone i showed or recited exactly as written above the background of these two candidates to voters who dont follow politics very closely i ended up speaking with twenty different people from diverse backgrounds to be sure some of those i spoke with rightfully said in reality id need to know a lot more than youre giving me accepting that caveat all 20 people picked candidate b candidate b is dan quayle candidate a is barack obama stripped of his name the color of his skin or his history making primary win in a blind experience only test does mr obama possess a resume that is worthy of the oval office
1699312 i was recently on a tour of latin america and the only regret i have was that i didn t study latin harder in school so i could converse with those people

1699316 mars is essentially in the same orbit mars is somewhat the same distance from the sun which is very important we have seen pictures where there are canals we believe and water if there is water that means there is oxygen if there is oxygen that means we can breathe
1699317 what a waste it is to lose one s mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful how true that is
1699318 the holocaust was an obscene period in our nation s history i mean in this century s history but we all lived in this century i didn t live in this century
1699319 i believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and democracy but that could change
1699320 one word sums up probably the responsibility of any vice president and that one word is to be prepared

1699327 i am not part of the problem i am a republican
1699328 a low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls
1699329 when i have been asked during these last weeks who caused the riots and the killing in l a my answer has been direct and simple who is to blame for the riots the rioters are to blame who is to blame for the killings the killers are to blame
1699330 illegitimacy is something we should talk about in terms of not having it
1699331 we are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not occur
1699332 quite frankly teachers are the only profession that teach our children
1699333 the american people would not want to know of any misquotes that dan quayle may or may not make
1699334 we re all capable of mistakes but i do not care to enlighten you on the mistakes we may or may not have made
1699335 it isn t pollution that s harming the environment it s the impurities in our air and water that are doing it

1699343 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never

1699346 wine country one day getaway was a very easy way to taste wines at three vineyards have lunch in picturesque greenport and not have to drive after having a few gewurztraminer and raspberry dessert wine from corey creek i look forward to cracking them open
1699347 they borrowed the legal theory from these abused womens defenses
1699348 and tried to analogize it to international law arguing that killing bin laden was legal because it was self defense under article 5 of the un charter because the united states like a battered woman needed to be able to kill in advance of the actual assault
1699349 not because there were no targets but because the legal requirements necessary before you pull the trigger are so onerous
1699350 even if congress had been consulted do you think there was a single member who would have said whoa hold up wait a minute these powers are too broad the consensus was that another round of attacks was pending and congress would support any action to stop it
1699351 the deal was we let you do this you dont embarrass us
1699352 scary question if paris and barack were your two choices which would you vote for i honest to god dont know who would be worse

1699356 we saw this as a way to engage new zealanders in supporting projects that reduce carbon emissions
1699357 how do we know how much of the electricity we save comes from fossil fuels and how much comes from a wind farm
1699358 the money is important but the real value is the analysis that facebook did of our proposal and the credibility boost that this gives us
1699359 we are thrilled that catalyst has been involved in such a successful venture for gary
1699360 we could see from the beginning when gary first approached us that he had a really compelling idea the chemistry between catalyst and the podclass team has enabled us to deliver an application that is now going to be part of the fourth busiest site in the world
1699361 gary asked us to start looking at facebook about a year ago
1699362 this may seem like a straightforward deal but there have been some complex negotiations involved
1699363 theyre not selling it thats looked down on in the home distilling crowd most people i know arent making more than a gallon at a time some people on the forum come from the moonshiner tradition and weve learned a lot from them but ive never met anyone who makes it for money
1699364 if we dont work on other projects at the same time it takes about six to eight weeks to finish a very detailed cityscape three eboys working on it nearly full time but if we have to do it in our spare time which happens often it could take years to finish a picture since we cant spend so much time on it
1699365 if you are the son of god tell this stone to become a loaf of bread
1699366 i will give you the glory of these kingdoms and authority over them
1699367 because they are mine to give to anyone i please i will give it all to you if you will worship me
1699368 the scriptures say you must worship the lord your god and serve only him
1699369 the scriptures also say you must not test the lord your god
1699370 though he was god he did not think of equality with god as something to cling to instead he gave up his divine privileges he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being
1699371 for god made christ who never sinned to be the offering for our sin so that we could be made right with god through christ
1699372 for he faced all of the same testings we do yet he did not sin
1699373 but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses telling people about me everywhere in jerusalem throughout judea in samaria and to the ends of the earth
1699374 humble yourself you only think you know what you should do let me fill you with my mighty power because you are not strong enough on your own work for my honor not other peoples opinions trust me to handle the worries and concerns dont you realize how much i care about you watch out satan wants to devour your time and your soul stand with me against the temptation to do what you or others think will be good i will call you to your ministries and your strength and guidance will come from trusting me stand firm in your faith and i will fight the roaring lion for you
1699375 it is not a lack of spiritual experience that leads to failure but a lack of working to keep our eyes focused and on the right goal

1699419 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided in our incentives package i think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive

1699441 the implications from pauls portrayal of the olive tree to warn gentiles in harsh terms leads to a theological development that i believe paul did not anticipate when he created it for it is used to describe the state of non christ believing israelites as broken off discarded and dead branches on the ground below the tree which clearly depicts them as having fallen in terms of the stumbling metaphor that is a condition paul emphatically insisted did not apply i believe paul would deny that these israelites were broken off as it has been presented in the interpretive tradition and that he would extend this denial today if asked to describe the state of jews and judaism he would instead insist in the same unmistakable terms that he communicated in the stumbling allegory may it never be the tree allegory was created with the special concern to describe the present state of the gentile believers in christ and the inferences about these israelites are il logical byproducts of that explanation what we have here is a pauline metaphor gone awry

1699446 bundling of ta into topical trust funds for fund raising purposes
1699447 what is happening with imf ta looks quite regressive ownership of economic policy reforms is central to successful development and to long term capacity development technical assistance has been notorious in failing to build capacity because as an instrument it is precisely taking ownership away from developing countries at the core of the problem is that the power relationship embedded in ta contradicts ownership this is obviously an issue that needs serious analysis and debate
1699448 the managing directors task force on ta has recommended that departments proactively encourage ta recipients to consider publication on the funds external website

1699472 steeds meer mensen weten dankzij de overheidscampagne denk vooruit wat zij moeten doen bij een ramp in de buurt van hun huis maar hoewel een gedegen rampenvoorbereiding voor bedrijven nog belangrijker is ontbreekt bij de meeste bedrijven het rampenplan of het is onvolledig alleen bedrijfshulpverleners op laten leiden en een verzamelplaats aanwijzen is niet genoeg er moet ook worden nagedacht over wat en hoe te communiceren bij een ramp zowel extern wie neemt er contact op met de hulpdiensten als intern hoe waarschuw je de medewerkers
1699473 vooral dat laatste is belangrijk je kunt er niet op vertrouwen dat medewerkers reageren op alleen een sirene onderzoek wijst uit dat de helft van alle medewerkers dan blijft zitten omdat ze denken dat het een oefening is of dat het zon vaart wel niet zal lopen geen rook of vuur dus geen gevaar wordt nog te vaak gedacht je moet dus naast een geluidssignaal ook andere media kunnen inzetten bij voorkeur zo veel mogelijk e mail sms berichten op grote schermen pop ups op pcs noem maar op zolang de medewerkers het maar snel te zien of te horen krijgen een alarmbericht moet bovendien bij voorkeur een duidelijke instructie bevatten zodat men beseft dat het menens is
1699474 tenslotte moet je beseffen dat een ramp nooit volgens het boekje verloopt dus wat doe je als er brand is op de aangewezen verzamelplek of als de belangrijkste vluchtroute is geblokkeerd dan moet je de mensen wel snel op de hoogte kunnen brengen
1699475 omdat we vaak horen dat bedrijven niet weten waar te beginnen met een rampenplan hebben we een checklist gemaakt hopelijk kunnen we bedrijven met deze handvaten bewegen de rustige zomerperiode te benutten om hun rampenplan op te tuigen

1699496 in addition to connecting to others it also gives them a one stop shop on articles and content surrounding what interests them this isnt only for fitness but can be applied across the board for fashion beauty and so on
1699497 niche social networks have more meat than sites like facebook which are really about stalking your friends

1699540 likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know what to pray for as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words and he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god

1699550 the purpose of modern government is to take money from the folks who save and pay their bills and live within their means and use that to hire government workers and to keep their power by using the money to buy votes from those who do not save and pay their bills and live within their means and of course the money comes from those who work and save and pay their bills and live within their means who else will have any money for the government to take

1699555 in terms of the pure hypervisor clearly esxi is more appealing

1699557 support is not included with the free esxi if you want that it starts at 495 per server per year
1699558 this doesnt really address the typical enterprises cost of vmware deployment just the marketing threat of the low hyper v starting price
1699559 if virtual machine manager microsofts management suite and hyper v together meet your needs and the price is lower why not
1699560 if you have a lot of vmware installed and you love vmware wow the choice just got easier on the other hand yeah there are reasons to go with hyper v a lot of it comes down to licensing
1699561 it looks like in the short term paul maritz is willing to sacrifice revenue in order to go up the stack because where theyre really going to make their money is the vmware infrastructure platform
1699562 paul maritz has his eye on the prize hes taking a very long term strategic view of things which is the right thing to do and not just looking for short term profits

1699572 and while the feds rate cuts may have provided a psychological boost to the markets many analysts and builders think it will take more cuts and more time before the housing market recovers

1699653 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1699654 the lone prosecution witness impressed the court as a witness of truth
1699655 i am therefore compulsorily led to the inevitable conclusion that the evidence adduced by the prosecution if any is not only manifestly unreliable such evidence is manifestly a clear testimony of the innocence of the accused
1699656 i am therefore satisfied that the arraignment and half hearted prosecution of the accused before this court is both capricious and needless
1699657 it is based on all the above that i conclude almost effortlessly that the no case submission of the defence succeeds in its entirety the accused is consequently discharged and acquitted for want of evidence pursuant to section 166 of the cpc
1699658 there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized for the sake of unity
1699659 people complain that we do not know who we are but part of what it means to be anglican is not being able to say precisely who we are
1699660 did not rule out the possibility that muslim fundamentalists linked to hamas or the mens relatives had pushed them to carry out the attacks as part of a plan aimed at cleansing their names
1699661 during the first and second intifadas various palestinian groups succeeded in recruiting palestinian criminals to carry out terrorist attacks these criminals included thieves rapists and drug dealers

1699665 left wing gulags were not only in the soviet union but astonishingly in grade schools here in america as well
1699666 in response to the reagan victory the schools flag was lowered to half staff and the morning assembly was devoted to what today would be called grief counseling
1699667 the only students to raise their hands were ignat and his two brothers yermolai and stephan after a stony silence he recalled they were sent outside without their coats to meditate on the error of their ways underneath the lowered flag vermont in november was hardly siberia but there was frost on the ground and they spent an hour shivering and exercising to stay warm still ignat said their political exile was a relief from sitting in the auditorium listening to the party line
1699668 we know karl rove and his shadowy army of outside groups have no plan to surrender theyre planning to roll out a rapid fire barrage of swift boat style attacks against all of our democratic candidates
1699669 madam speaker yesterday the house voted on a motion to censure the gentleman from new york mr rangel
1699670 members had no advance notice of the vote and i did not familiarize myself with the substance of the motion as much as i would have liked
1699671 if the vote were taken again i would vote present rather than aye
1699672 madam speaker during floor debate on the legislation to regulate tobacco yesterday i made some remarks that unfairly and inaccurately personalized the issue and i am here today to apologize to my friend and colleague john boehner
1699673 i have the utmost respect for his professional abilities as well as great affection for him personally i did not intend for my remarks to be taken in any way as personal criticism as a friend i just did not want to see anything bad happen to him or for his family to be burdened unnecessarily in any way
1699674 at this point if barack obama really wanted to cause excitement with his vice president pick and do the unexpected he will put hillary clinton on the ticket as his veep running mate
1699675 it would not have been a positive dynamic the press would all be quite bored with it by now and the bill factor would be front and center throughout the summer
1699676 but if obama picks her now the press democrats and a host of others will all go crazy and the faux unity of the party will have democrat conventioneers in denver fainting like teeny boppers at a miley cyrus hannah montana concert
1699677 as somebody who has family living overseas who myself have lived overseas for a time i would be able to i think the world would see me as a different kind of president somebody who could see the world through their eyes if i convened a meeting with muslim leaders around the world to discuss how they can align themselves in our battle against terrorism but also put our the relationship between the west and the islamic world on a more productive footing i do so with the credibility of somebody who actually lived in a muslim country for a number of years
1699678 we are praying for obama because we feel he can help reduce the widespread stigma and misperception that muslims in indonesia are fundamentalists
1699679 there is no doubt that the new wave of attacks in palestine will wipe off this stigma israel from the face of the islamic world anybody who recognizes israel will burn in the fire of the islamic nations fury israel will burn in the fire of the islamic nations fury
1699680 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1699681 both senator obama and ludacris have initiated individual efforts to bring attention to the cause and the senator applauded ludacris for using his stature and his celebrity to bring attention to the issue
1699682 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1699683 we could save all the oil theyre talking about drilling if people would just inflate their tires
1699684 slow down look around you now look to me there is hope enough here to last a lifetime
1699685 just another example of bush policies helping the rich get richer
1699686 first bush cut taxes for the rich and the economy has rebounded with new record low unemployment rates which only means wealthy employers are getting even wealthier at the expense of the underpaid working class
1699687 only the rich benefit from these record highs working americans welfare recipients the unemployed and minorities are not sharing in these obscene record highs
1699688 there is no question these windfall profits and income created by the bush administration need to be taxed at 100 rate and those dollars redistributed to the poor and working class
1699689 profits from the stock market do not reward the hard work of our working class who by their hard work are responsible for generating these corporate profits that create stock market profits for the rich we in congress will need to address this issue to either tax these profits or to control the stock market to prevent this unearned income to flow to the rich
1699690 we democrats are going to address this issue after the election when we take control of the congress we will return to the 60 to 80 tax rates on the rich and we will be able to take at least 30 of all currrent lower federal income tax taxpayers off the roles and increase government income substantially we need to work toward the goal of equalizing income in our country and at the same time limiting the amount the rich can invest
1699691 we need to raise the standard of living of our

1699702 i didnt buy a handgun to kill people i bought it to protect myself and my family

1699705 i want to teach my son about the guns and make sure my family is safe
1699706 unfortunately users are very trusting of messages left by friends on social networking sites so the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high

1699720 weve seen house prices rise by about 180 over the last 10 years and they have risen by about 18 over the last three years so a 2 5 fall is something that is containable

1699724 as a coach the greatest reward is to see your athletes happy motivated and swimming fast all of these were met at the meet the team spirit was the best it has ever been with every athlete getting on the block with their 15 other teammates firmly in their corner it was a lot of fun
1699725 at least two of our swimmers dominique massie martel and ashley mcgregor have likely qualified for the upcoming junior pan pacific championships

1699741 with manufacturers introducing an increasing number of new vehicles each year consumers may find it harder to keep track of whats available in the marketplace and how one vehicle differs from another the ajac canadian car of the year program identifies and categorizes all the new vehicles each year then subjects them to detailed testing in real world situations its not a popularity contest its a thorough objective and trustworthy process to help consumers make informed purchase decisions
1699742 we are thrilled that ajacs members have endorsed the 2007 toyota camry hybrid with this important award and would like to thank the membership for their support

1699760 nog kort geleden had je in de besloten dorpsgemeenschap evenmin privacy iedereen wist wat je deed tot in je slaapkamer aan toe
1699761 in die metafoor is het de overheid die bestanden aanlegt en cameras ophangt om haar burgers te controleren
1699762 maar de werkelijkheid is veel ingewikkelder daar zijn het meestal bedrijven die een hele infrastructuur van gegevens cre ren dat doen ze voor hun eigen bedrijfsvoering en heel saillant op verzoek van burgers en consumenten die eisen namelijk dat ze beter sneller en persoonlijker worden behandeld maar vervolgens kan de overheid intappen op deze informatie bijvoorbeeld als ze dat nodig vindt voor de bescherming van de nationale veiligheid
1699763 organisaties kunnen bestanden aanleggen en aan elkaar koppelen en dus doen ze dat ook alle informatie uit die bestanden met elkaar uitwisselen is nu nog problematisch maar zal op termijn steeds beter lukken zo cre ren we met zn allen een steeds krachtiger instrument om controle uit te oefenen op het individu
1699764 stel bijvoorbeeld dat je kunt zien wie er moslims zijn en dat je ook in de bestanden kunt kijken van autoverhuurbedrijven en tuincentra
1699765 dan zou de optelsom van de feiten dat iemand moslim is een busje huurt en daarmee kunstmest koopt tot de conclusie kunnen leiden dat hij van plan is een bomaanslag te plegen
1699766 ik weet niet welke criteria het openbaar ministerie om en de algemene inlichtingen en veiligheidsdienst aivd hanteren om risicogroepen in de samenleving in kaart te brengen en ook niet hoe effectief dat is daar zeggen ze niets over maar er is zeker vanuit de politiek een enorme wil om gegevens bij elkaar te mieteren en daar vergaande uitspraken over te doen
1699767 als iemand met een bivakmuts en een pistool voor een wisselkantoor staat heeft de politie voldoende aanwijzingen en dus goede redenen om in te grijpen voordat de overval wordt gepleegd dat heeft de hoge raad in dit specifieke geval bevestigd maar hoe verder je teruggaat in de tijd en hoe meer je gaat varen op algemene kenmerken van mensen des te vager de aanwijzingen en hoe groter de kans dat je onschuldigen aanmerkt als verdachten
1699768 een blanke man die zich gedraagt volgens de normen van de heersende meerderheid zal niet snel op de radar komen
1699769 maar het probleem is dat niet j j maar degenen die over de informatie beschikken bepalen of jij iets hebt te verbergen
1699770 bovendien als jij zegt controleer me maar zeg je in feite dat de overheid ook naar lieve lust anderen mag controleren en dus verdacht kan maken
1699771 de overheid kreeg onlangs van haar burgers nog het cijfer 5 2 dus een wel zeer magere beoordeling van haar betrouwbaarheid maar als het om onze persoonlijke informatie gaat vertrouwen we alles wat ze doet
1699772 we willen ze nu allemaal opsporen tot de laatste verdachte onze privacy is daaraan ondergeschikt
1699773 de privacygoeroes die proberen de komst van nieuwe systemen tegen te houden voeren een achterhoedegevecht alsof je je twintig jaar geleden tegen de komst van internet zou keren
1699774 als er naast een toegangspoortje van de ns een lijk ligt heeft de overheid volkomen gelijk dat ze achterhaalt wie er allemaal door dat poortje is gelopen mits natuurlijk alleen de mensen worden gecheckt die daar op of rond het tijdstip van de moord waren ik vind de chip die reageert op radiofrequenties en die op afstand kan worden uitgelezen technologisch gezien een mooi ding dat vele nuttige toepassingen kan hebben
1699775 als de fotos van stomdronken feestgangers alleen circuleren in hun vriendenclub begrijpt elk lid van de club dat de deelnemers op dat feestje niemand kwaad deden en in het gewone leven brave mensen zijn maar zodra je de beelden uit hun context haalt bijvoorbeeld door ze op internet voor iedereen toegankelijk te maken worden ze vervormd en kunnen anderen ermee aan de haal dan tikt het bedrijf waar je solliciteert je naam in op de zoekmachine google en concludeert ze dat je een onverantwoordelijke zatlap bent zo krijg je een imago waar je mogelijk nooit meer af komt
1699776 ik verbaas me erover dat zelfs hier weinig mensen de reflex hebben van stop want n kom je op mijn gebied
1699777 cda minister maxime verhagen kan doodleuk zeggen dat hij liever heeft dat er tien onschuldigen vastzitten dan dat er n schuldige vrij rondloopt daar maak ik me zorgen over want hij ontkent daarmee een van de belangrijkste principes van het strafrecht namelijk dat je niet eerder schuldig bent dan dat een rechter je op grond van wettig en overtuigend bewijs veroordeelt
1699778 naast de privacywaakhond van de overheid het college bescherming persoonsgegevens cbp zouden onafhankelijke burgerrechtenorganisaties de vinger aan de pols moeten houden
1699779 als iemand door het samenvoegen van gegevens als verdachte wordt aangemerkt zou dat minstens rechterlijk moeten worden getoetst
1699780 de meeste politici zijn geobsedeerd door de strijd tegen criminaliteit en terrorisme maar als we 16 miljoen nederlanders op zeg twintig criteria doorlichten rond de vraag of het potenti le terroristen zijn staat er straks een half miljoen mensen op de no flylist van de luchtvaartmaatschappijen dat slaat nergens op en bedreigt bovendien de sociale cohesie zo kun je niet met mensen omgaan het vertrouwen in de technologie is veel te groot en het zo massaal verzamelen van informatie is zeer ineffici nt om boeven te pakken zou ik vooral het ouderwetse speurwerk niet verwaarlozen
1699781 nederlanders zijn daar juist helemaal niet zo angstig over blijkt telkens weer uit onderzoek er is een grote discrepantie tussen de activisten op het gebied van privacy en de gewone burger
1699782 door een onverschillige houding ik heb toch niks te verbergen en desinteresse in wie er allemaal met zijn persoonsgegevens aan de haal gaat is de burger zelf medeverantwoordelijk voor het verdwijnen van de privacy in nederland
1699783 om een abonnement te administreren hebben we zowel de reisgegevens als de naam en het adres van de houder van de ov chipkaart nodig bovendien stelt het systeem ons in staat onze klanten nog beter te bedienen bijvoorbeeld als we ze gunstige aanbiedingen willen doen
1699784 bovendien is de noodzaak allerminst aangetoond er zijn andere manieren om in te spelen op de behoeften van de klanten
1699785 van onze leden is 61 procent tegen het vastleggen van persoonsgegevens door openbaarvervoerbedrijven
1699786 anderzijds erkent 34 procent dat ze er hun dienstverlening mee kunnen verbeteren
1699787 we hebben het wel een beetje gehad met de ns
1699788 ons probleem is en blijft de koppeling van persoonsgegevens aan reisgegevens dus het feit dat je straks precies kan nagaan wie op welke trajecten en tijdstippen hebben gereisd
1699789 zolang dat niet is opgelost voldoen de ns niet aan de wet
1699790 er vindt nu geen overleg meer plaats maar we wachten met belangstelling op het moment dat de ns ons vertellen dat ze zullen voldoen aan onze voorwaarden
1699791 dan gaan we boetes uitdelen of vragen we de rechter om de praktijk te toetsen aan de wet
1699792 er zijn nog zo veel technische en organisatorische problemen met de invoering van de ov chipkaart dat we blij zijn dat het cbp dit voor zijn rekening kan nemen
1699793 wat ons betreft mag het gebruik van reizigersgegevens uitsluitend mogelijk zijn als de klant daar expliciet zelf bij de ns om vraagt bijvoorbeeld omdat hij belangstelling heeft voor commerci le aanbiedingen geeft de klant dat niet aan dan zien wij geen reden waarom de ns zijn gegevens zouden moeten registreren
1699794 we zullen de gegevens alleen op verzoek van de klant en in het belang van de klant met elkaar koppelen en dat zal dan uitsluitend gebeuren door personen die daartoe zijn geautoriseerd
1699795 sommigen lijken te denken dat als ze straks naar den haag centraal reizen ze de volgende dag op hetzelfde station een aanbieding krijgen van de bloemenstal dat is totaal niet aan de orde wat de klant w l kan verwachten nou bijvoorbeeld dat als hij geregeld enkeltjes of retourtjes op hetzelfde traject koopt wij hem zullen informeren dat een abonnement of een voordeelurenkaart veel goedkoper is dat is geen marketing dat is de klant voordeel aanbieden zo halen we er voor hem het beste uit
1699796 vergelijk dat met een land als frankrijk waar het reizen binnen de landsgrenzen zonder geregistreerd te worden als een grondrecht wordt beschouwd en in praag is de stedelijke persoonlijke ov chipkaart deze zomer zelfs verboden
1699797 natuurlijk is het straks aan ons om te bewijzen dat we de privacy van onze reizigers respecteren
1699798 degene die deze systemen implementeren moeten daarom een eenvoudig te begrijpen overeenkomst voor hun eindgebruikers opstellen
1699799 een arts die een verzekering wil checken heeft genoeg aan het feit waar de pati nt is verzekerd en eventueel wat zijn verzekeringsnummer is waarom moet iedereen weten waar iemand woont ik zie niet in waarom je ook nog iemands polis en aanvullende polis moet kunnen zien
1699800 als een apotheek vijftien mensen in dienst heeft en de apotheker wil dat al die mensen het systeem gebruiken dan moet elk van hen zijn eigen certificaat hebben zon certificaat werkt bovendien slechts een jaar
1699801 als het wachtwoord inderdaad slechts uit vier tekens bestaat verbaast me dat dat is niet veel en als 79 000 mensen toegang hebben heeft iedere nederlander dus wel iemand in zijn kennissenkring die erin kan
1699802 het systeem wordt lang niet bij alle pati nten geraadpleegd
1699803 de meesten hebben namelijk een zorgpas met alle benodigde informatie twijfelt de zorgverlener dan kan hij eventueel vragen om een identiteitsbewijs en twijfelt hij dan nog wat weinig voorkomt dan kan hij inloggen op vecozo maar dat is extra werk trouwens ik maak mij sterk dat als een huisarts informatie misbruikt voor andere doelen dan zijn medische praktijk hij voor de tuchtrechter een groot probleem heeft
1699804 wij houden het gebruik nauwkeurig bij als een zorgverlener voortdurend snuffelt in de informatie van bijvoorbeeld bekende nederlanders dan zien wij dat en starten we een onderzoek
1699805 blijkt dat de zorgverlener het systeem misbruikt dan kan dat inderdaad een tuchtzaak worden
1699806 vroeger had ik een kaartenbak waarin alleen de mensen bij mijn eigen praktijk stonden en die door anderen niet kon worden geraadpleegd
1699807 daarmee wist ik alles wat ik moest weten wie is die persoon en is hij bij het ziekenfonds of particulier verzekerd zo kon ik declareren maar nu kan ik deze informatie van alle nederlanders raadplegen en kunnen anderen bovendien m jn pati nten natrekken
1699808 ik behandelde een vrouw die systematisch was mishandeld door haar man en die uiteindelijk hun woning had verruild voor een geheim adres even haar naam en geboortedatum intikken en dat adres staat op mijn scherm zo loopt ze direct gevaar
1699809 dat we in nederland alles graag centraal willen opslaan en beheren maar juist dat levert zoveel risicos op
1699810 in de politiek zijn het verzamelen en koppelen van gegevensbanken echter al jaren een soort mantra als het om persoonlijke informatie gaat de trend is heel erg dat alles gedeeld moet worden bij de aanslagen van 9 11 wordt dan gezegd we hadden ze kunnen pakken als we gegevens hadden kunnen koppelen en bij incidenten in de jeugdzorg werd dat ook weer gesteld maar in beide gevallen was adequaat optreden voldoende geweest
1699811 als een verzekeraar niet wil dat bepaalde informatie wordt vrijgegeven moet hij er zelf voor zorgen dat het er niet in staat
1699812 guy that will try some stuff but do it apprehensively then hurt himself because he didnt just go for it
1699813 but i believe its not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living under the occupation of the chinese government
1699814 as ive said before with our friends in beijing we will always raise our human rights concerns with them ive done that in the past ive done it privately ive done it publicly and ill be doing that again
1699815 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1699816 i was a little bit nervous at the beginning but once you get on the court it is all excitement this is one game that i learned a lot from from the point guards to their big men and just the style of play the usa has i learned a lot
1699817 ive been in australia a long time and you guys probably know better than i do what an nba player is
1699818 but i thought tonight he held his own hes lightning quick
1699819 the thing about patrick that is great for our game and great for our country is we havent had a lot of aboriginal athletes in basketball
1699820 hes got a whole community behind him and hes an excitement package you could feel that tonight he got the crowd involved in the game and got them behind our team hes been great for the game and id love to see him play in the nba
1699821 in the games that we watched beforehand he wasnt a driver for them today he played just great we need to expect that from people when they play against us it was almost like he had nothing to lose we had to play good fundamental defence and he just beat us
1699822 every extra hour spent by households and businesses grappling with the myriad of tax rules and obligations including the different regimes across the states is an hour not used to produce goods and services including utilising leisure time that are of higher value to australians
1699823 duplication overlap and inconsistency severely hamper the effectiveness of the overall system and australias international competitiveness
1699824 whether it was at the university of wisconsin at both the madison campus and the system as a whole the university of massachusetts western michigan university the national science foundation the social science research council the russell sage foundation or the american sociological association they have all benefited from her intellect and commitment to making these institutions and those that they serve more inclusive and diverse
1699825 she has herself not only opened doors directly for african american scholars but set up expectations for excellence and opportunities to excel that have directly paid dividends across the profession of sociology and related social science disciplines

1699829 er is gespeeld met van alles bij het paleis zoals met bootjes
1699830 we kennen de verhalen en hebben ze onderzocht maar dit heeft nooit tot concrete verdenkingen jegens medewerkers geleid misschien zijn het sterke verhalen van de koffietafel
1699831 we zouden ons waarschijnlijk rot schrikken als we op een rijtje zouden hebben welke gegevens van ons allemaal zijn opgeslagen in computerbestanden het bewustzijn is gewoon bij heel veel mensen niet aanwezig het zou goed zijn als dat al op school zou worden bijgebracht
1699832 mensen moeten juist het idee hebben dat ze in de gaten worden gehouden
1699833 je moet ze uit de anonimiteit halen van mij mogen er juist best meer privacybeperkende maatregelen komen het zijn immers alleen de kwaden die daaronder lijden de goeden hebben niets te vrezen die hebben immers niets te verbergen
1699834 maar wij zijn de laatste jaren de vvd als bondgenoot kwijtgeraakt
1699835 maar dat wil niet zeggen dat de vvd privacy niet belangrijk vindt wij vullen het alleen anders in kijk naar de laatste oud en nieuwviering
1699836 het is nog nooit zo erg geweest mensen kunnen zich blijkbaar niet gedragen als ze niet in de gaten worden gehouden in ridderkerk zijn tijdens oud en nieuw niet ge niformeerde agenten ingezet dat heeft geholpen blijkbaar worden mensen ervan weerhouden om bepaalde dingen te doen als ze denken dat ze in de gaten worden gehouden
1699837 hoe meer je mensen elektronisch kunt volgen hoe meer agenten je vrijspeelt voor fysiek toezicht op straat
1699838 daar maakt 28 procent van de mensen zich druk over ik hoor bij die andere 72 procent
1699839 het is ook een valse tegenstelling die wordt gecre erd alsof maatregelen die de privacy aantasten leiden tot minder individuele vrijheid maar die vrijheid blijft overeind ook als mensen digitaal worden gevolgd sterker je kunt zelfs redeneren dat de individuele vrijheid erdoor toeneemt want al dat toezicht zorgt er ook voor dat jij en ik veilig in het openbaar vervoer kunnen zitten
1699840 ook ik vind het goed dat we dna technieken hebben waarmee we jaren later nog moordzaken kunnen oplossen maar moeten we dna van 16 miljoen mensen vastleggen op het gebied van de privacybescherming hebben we de laatste 5 6 jaar per meter weer weggegeven wat we daarvoor per millimeter hebben bevochten
1699841 sinds de aanslagen van 11 september 2001 waarbij tot onze schrik passagiersvliegtuigen bleken te kunnen worden ingezet als vliegende bommen wordt burgers steevast deze keuze voorgehouden wilt u veiligheid of wilt u dood dat is een oneigenlijke keuze maar de burger denkt al snel dan kies ik toch maar voor wat minder privacy
1699842 bovendien laten we als europeanen de verenigde staten ook nog in belangrijke mate bepalen waarin we dat doen want de 27 eu landen slagen er voortdurend niet in n lijn te trekken tegen de wensen van de vs ik durf te beweren dat de persoonlijke levenssfeer van de gemiddelde amerikaan op dit moment beter is beschermd dan die van de gemiddelde europeaan daar hebben ze een heel sterke burgerrechtenbeweging ons college bescherming persoonsgegevens een waakhondje
1699843 bij alles wat om veiligheid gaat is een soort maakbaarheid is komen bovendrijven in de politiek de overheid pretendeert dat ook allemaal te kunnen politici en de overheid sturen ook vaak op angst dat verbaast me ook zo aan de opstelling van de vvd deze partij pleit altijd voor een kleinere overheid maar op het gebied van veiligheid verwacht de vvd echt alles van de overheid
1699844 het heeft natuurlijk ook te maken met de vraag of je vertrouwen hebt in je eigen overheid d66 gaat altijd uit van het goede in de mens maar hier niet wat wil je dan allerlei dossiers nog steeds per map overdragen van de ene instantie naar de andere van het ene ziekenhuis naar het andere het is ook een kwestie van hoeveel gemak de mens wil hebben en hoe betrouwbaar je degene vindt die met jouw gegevens mag werken bovendien denk ik dat we over 10 tot 20 jaar geen keuze meer hebben zoals je er nu al niet meer voor kunt kiezen om geen bankrekening te hebben
1699845 dat is natuurlijk een stuk handiger dan een ponskaart aan een ketting om je nek die je kunt vergeten of kwijtraken
1699846 maar ik wil er wel zelf voor kunnen kiezen en ik wil ook zelf kunnen bepalen welke persoonlijke gegevens op die chip worden opgeslagen
1699847 we moeten niet krijgen dat je ov chipkaart wordt gekoppeld aan je creditcard en vervolgens weer aan je elektronisch pati ntendossier
1699848 ik heb vandaag geld overgemaakt naar de verenigde staten waar ik iets heb besteld
1699849 reuze handig maar ik zou toch niet willen dat mijn bankgegevens nu meteen werden gekoppeld aan mijn ziektekostenverzekering
1699850 vraag mcnealy nu nog maar eens of privacy dood is nadat je in zijn eigen computer hebt ingebroken of op een site zijn wachtwoord hebt gestolen
1699851 wat je van privacy op het internet vindt hangt natuurlijk sterk af van aan welke kant van de camera je staat mcnealy verdiende in 1999 zijn geld aan het feit dat steeds meer mensen op het web een deel van hun privacy opgaven
1699852 maar privacy is helemaal niet dood dat is ook niet de kwestie wel of geen privacy privacy en veiligheid vormen twee kanten van de zelfde medaille tussen die twee moet je voortdurend afwegingen maken
1699853 we leven tegenwoordig in een wolk van informatie daarin moeten we bepalen welke data we per se willen beschermen en welke gegevens wel en door wie ingezien mogen worden
1699854 een van mijn onderzoeksterreinen is deep packet inspection wat neerkomt op het bekijken van de inhoud van de pakketjes bits waarmee informatie over het internet wordt verstuurd routers op internet moeten die pakketjes net zo vaak naar een volgend adres doorsturen totdat de informatie de bestemming bereikt daarvoor kijken routers naar het adreslabeltje dat aan een pakketje is toegevoegd maar de routers zijn inmiddels zo krachtig geworden dat ze ook heel snel naar de inhoud van een pakketje kunnen kijken en kunnen bepalen wat ze daar dan mee moeten doen het is alsof de postbode je brief open maakt en aan de hand van de inhoud bepaalt of hij de brief zal bezorgen
1699855 die technologie kun je heel rechtmatig en nuttig gebruiken maar het kan uiteraard ook heel beangstigende effecten hebben de router kan ontdekken dat de pakketjes onderdeel uitmaken van een telefoongesprek en dus voorrang behoeven op pakketjes die minder aan tijd gebonden zijn maar h ontdekt de eigenaar van de router dat telefoongesprek is van een abonnee van een concurrent dus dat kan wel even wachten of de router ontdekt dat ik een videofilm verstuur waar copyright op rust en houdt de betreffende pakketjes dus tegen
1699856 het laatste speelt al in belgi waar een rechter internetproviders op verzoek van de muziek en filmindustrie wil verplichten om de pakketjes allemaal te inspecteren en zonodig te blokkeren maar dan begeef je je op een hellend vlak je laat machines oordelen over zaken waar je eerst een rechter voor nodig had en machines kunnen dat gewoon niet zo goed computers denken binair het is een 1 of een 0 het is goed of het is slecht
1699857 neem bijvoorbeeld een filmpje op youtube waar een stukje video in is verwerkt uit een speelfilm diefstal zegt de industrie blokkeren zegt de computer die het stukje film herkent maar jij als journalist mag citaten van anderen overnemen in jouw geschreven stukken dat is een redelijk gebruik en ook voor educatiedoeleinden kan het van belang zijn om originele filmfragmenten te gebruiken
1699858 in nederland ga ik ook extra aandacht besteden aan privacy in combinatie met mobiel internet nu al kunnen overheden bij mobiele belbedrijven opvragen waar je wanneer naar welk ander nummer je hebt gebeld zo meteen kun je met je mobieltje via google heel makkelijk restaurants vinden in de omgeving waar je op dat moment bent als jouw zoekvragen worden bewaard door google kan iemand achteraf vaststellen ach meneer mueller u stond woensdag om kwart voor zes voor oude delft 83 en zocht een chinees restaurant hebt u in dat restaurant toevallig niet die en die ontmoet en mobiel gebruik gaat draadloos waardoor anderen met de juiste apparatuur ongemerkt draadloos de gegevens uit jouw mobiele telefoon kunnen aftappen
1699859 internet maakt een openheid en creativiteit mogelijk die zijn weerga niet kent maar ook een ongekende hoeveelheid spam en nieuwe vormen van criminaliteit dat roept een beeld van chaos op de uitwassen wil men bestrijden door betere controle de politieke debatten van de jaren twintig en dertig van de vorige eeuw dreigen zich te herhalen toen zorgden democratisering en een nieuwe kapitalistische maatschappijvorm voor chaos en werd links en rechts geroepen om een dictator om de orde te herstellen maar de orde van een gecentraliseerde macht is een valse orde die doodt de dynamiek van een samenleving je hebt juist een macht nodig die decentrale besluitvorming stimuleert
1699860 je kunt het internet ook goed met een stad vergelijken je wilt criminaliteit zo veel mogelijk buiten de poorten houden maar dat zal je nooit helemaal lukken zelfs als je de privacy heel vergaand afschaft en maximale controle toepast kan dat niet de chinese overheid heeft bijna onbeperkte macht om de openbare veiligheid te beschermen is de criminaliteit daar minder nee zij verplaatst zich hooguit van misschien wat minder straatroof naar meer corruptie je m et een afweging maken tussen zinvolle controle en het recht op privacy en vrijheid anders smoor je de ontwikkeling van een samenleving
1699861 ik denk dat privacy bezig is aan een stevige come back na 9 11 was er in de vs en europa een brede bereidheid privacy uit het raam te gooien daar komt nu een kentering in over een jaar na het vertrek van de regering bush zal dat ook zeker in amerika gebeuren of er nu een democratische of een republikeinse president komt een deel van de privacyschendingen die de afgelopen jaren mogelijk zijn geworden zullen worden teruggedraaid
1699862 het probleem is nog wel dat mensen ook politici te snel geneigd zijn te denken dat privacy op het internet een kwestie van techniek is apparaten maken de schending van privacy mogelijk en dus lossen we dat ook wel weer op met apparaten en systemen maar bij de privacy gaat het om informatie en in een samenleving zijn er conflicterende belangen rond informatie wie mag de data gebruiken en kan ze daardoor misbruiken uiteindelijk gaat het niet om apparaten maar om institutionele en politieke vragen waarop een antwoord moet worden geformuleerd
1699863 wat een onzin om je daarover druk te maken niemand kan iets met die gegevens
1699864 in another few days i will sail on one of the free gaza movement boats from cyprus to gaza

1699867 het chipje zelf kost inmiddels de spreekwoordelijke drie keer niks maar omdat er een antenne bij moet en het geheel op een label of tag moet worden aangebracht komt er toch nog wel wat bij een label kost mits in grote aantallen nu zon tien cent
1699868 het zal nog wel vijf tot tien jaar duren voordat in supermarkten en dergelijke alle producten van een rfid tag zijn voorzien
1699869 de vraag wordt dan gebruik je de chip tot aan de winkel tot aan de kassa of ook nog daarna het kan heel goed dat de chip voor de consument ook na aankoop nog waarde heeft
1699870 rfid lezers zijn tegenwoordig voor een paar tientjes te koop je hoeft straks je lezer maar in de buurt van iemand te houden om de rfid code van zijn jas of polshorloge uit te lezen vervolgens maak je een bom die alleen afgaat als de rfid chip met die ene code langskomt

1699900 het is onbegrijpelijk dat er zo wordt doorgevraagd door agenten terwijl duidelijk is dat de verdachte geen zinnig woord kan zeggen dat is niet alleen heel pijnlijk voor de verdachte maar ook de verklaring die uiteindelijk op papier wordt gezet door de politie is waardeloos
1699901 ten dienste van de harmonische ontwikkeling van de mens moet stellen een vreedzame maatschappij moet zien te bevorderen met behoud van de menselijke waardigheid

1699920 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1699921 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
1699922 that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1699923 thats not sport its plain cheating and we need to be vigilant in nailing those who cross the line
1699924 yeah god its disappointing just for our sport and for the olympic games for tamsyn to come out and say that
1699925 it just detracts from our sport at her own personal gain or situation so thats what disappoints me
1699926 she is thinking more about her own situation rather than our sport that we all love and do for the right reasons not the wrong reasons
1699927 i was slammed from pillar to the post by the media for not making it past the first round and then i get this news that the girl just in front of me goes positive
1699928 i want to run a pb personal best time and im not making excuses but the facts are there will be those who simply dont want to compete on a level playing field
1699929 i am no moral crusader but when i was competing recently in europe the english girls came up and congratulated me on my world indoor title and said the best thing about it was the fact i did it on my own merit and it was one for the good guys
1699930 i can put my head on the pillow at night and know in my heart of hearts i havent cheated and we must continue the fight
1699931 you cheat you pay the price and unfortunately your relay teammates suffer the same fate and there are simply no other options
1699932 theyre catching people you get out there and you run tamsyn cant do anything about the people shes running against so why set up that precedent a couple of days before the games
1699933 lewis is setting up a situation that people will maybe see her in a different light or see her performance in a different light
