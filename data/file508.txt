5080217 you talk about the definition of a save and thats it
5080218 lewis showed a lot of moxie out there we were playing no doubles on defense so that first ball drops in jensen had to bow his neck and thats what he did
5080219 it tightened up a little bit but im not coming out of the game because of something like that
5080220 it should be fine im not planning on missing my next start
5080221 its not exactly where we want to be but weve got a shot
5080222 a 6 4 road trip is a good trip but i just look at my two starts and we lost both of them
5080223 if we won both it could have been a great trip
5080224 it was great for me because id been struggling last month
5080225 i got on my mechanics a little bit better now im keeping my head straight too
5080226 we wonder if theyre getting tired and volquez gets upset for us even asking about it
5080227 i have no comment on anything to do with him
5080228 to have your number retired its one of the greatest things that could ever happen to you
5080229 i knew the significance of it so i was nervous i havent been this nervous in a long time
5080230 i played the game i dearly loved to play since i was a kid
5080231 they gave me a number and now its hanging from the rafters

5080235 radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5080236 im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5080237 margaret thatcher in her time realised that the big challenge was reviving britains economy and we should recognise that the challenge for the modern conservatives is reviving our society
5080238 its dealing with the issues of family breakdown welfare dependency failing schools crime and the problems that we see in too many of our communities
5080239 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5080240 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5080241 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier

5080246 taking good pictures is obviously an aspect of getting good sales you dont have to be a professional photographer since buyers of stock photography need pictures of almost anything your photos have to be very much in focus and be void of any noise
5080247 by fixing the digital photo you now have a better chance of selling it and earning higher incomes on the internet i suggest if you are a freelance digital photographer to invest into buying or finding a photo editing program like photoshop

5080256 we are committed to provide better services to our passengers but condition of penalty is unfair especially because there are so many reasons which can cause delays or cancellation of flight and all the airlines do their level best to minimise the inconvenience to passengers in such situation

5080258 weapons allowing to hit only the facilities threatening our troops instead of fighting by carpet bombing
5080259 we think we have a guy in jonathan stewart for kickoffs how much we look at him in the preseason were just going to evaluate as we move forward punt returns really our lead guy is on the shelf in ryne robinson were looking at different guys and different guys can mean a lot of different places
5080260 hes an option were not announcing him as the starter by any stretch at this point but hes an option
5080261 weve still got work to do were halfway through the preseason and well get another indicator this week against washington and weve got a lot of practice time between now and then its like everything else weve just got to try to keep getting better
5080262 its definitely something i feel comfortable with because ive done it before i enjoy doing returning kicks and im excited about competing for that job
5080263 on punt returns i think ryne robinson improved as the year went on
5080264 the problem is you never recover statistically from that if youve struggled early in the year the same way with any statistic but we ended up respectable in that area not great penalties had a lot to do with that injuries affect your blocking units we had some long returns called back so that never helps your stats
5080265 it took awhile but i felt like i finally got comfortable out there
5080266 we have to improve all around and weve got some core guys that i think will help those units and were still evaluating the returner part of it
5080267 it was pretty devastating to watch the footage of me where i nearly died in the last bit and it is something that has never happened to me before and to happen on the big stage is not ideal
5080268 ive had a lot of people say they never want to see me in that state again and its almost embarrassing to see it its something im not proud of
5080269 i pushed myself to the limit and beyond but for peace of mind i know there was nothing more i could have done yesterday and that is where a bronze medal is highly valued because i know i put in an exceptional effort and won that bronze medal obviously i came here to win gold and that is something that will motivate me for another four years probably london 2012
5080270 after my semi i knew i was running slightly low on reserves so to manage that i tried to take it easy in the first half
5080271 you feel that in every race but normally on the last stroke not with 15 to go so that was pretty tough
5080272 it was a bit of a battle to get to the medal ceremony but it was something that was high on my agenda not so much for me but to respect the guys i was racing

5080278 the games were expensive very cheap compared to beijing or athens but at least the world now knows on which side of the iron curtain finland is
5080279 the car and transport equipment industry accounts for the largest share of romanias foreign trade the increase in production capacities as a result of investments in this segment makes a positive contribution towards the gradual reduction of the trade deficit
5080280 the trade deficit trend in the first half is in my opinion encouraging we are seeing exports increase faster than imports and an annual growth rate of 11 3 much below the 67 growth rate registered during the same period of last year the trend is also generated by the structural improvements of exports
5080281 boosting exports for certain product categories is part of the national strategy we try to export products with as high an added value as possible to move from timber to computers we are not allowed to ban exports of certain products but laws are a tool we can use to influence their structure
5080282 i have not decided on a candidate i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world

5080299 am putut sa intram si in centre comerciale pentru ca ne adresam clasei medii care devine astazi din ce in ce mai puternica avem trei categorii in meniu fructele de mare cu care ne adresam partii superioare a clasei medii si pizza si paste preparate accesibile pentru cei cu venituri medii
5080300 nu ne concentram doar pe gasirea unor potentiale locatii sau pe achizitii ale celor in care suntem deja prezenti in paralel mergem cu hotelul din predeal care este in curs de dezvoltare si ne vom axa pe organizari de evenimente in doua dintre restaurantele noastre cel din piata romana si cel din centrul istoric
5080301 din septembrie vom incepe sa organizam evenimente in cele doua unitati atat in cursul saptamanii cat si in weekend chiar daca activitatea de baza va ramane cea de restaurant pana acum participam doar cu caru cu bere dar am hotarat datorita cererii mari in aceasta directie sa ne extindem
5080302 trebuie sa fim foarte atenti pentru ca oricand dezechilibrul in bugetul familial in directia energiei poate sa constranga bugetele destinate iesirii la restaurant in vacanta sau altor categorii de activitati care pot fi taiate de pe lista inca nu se simte o incetinire a consumului si ne bucuram de fluxul de euro pe care l am primit de la romanii domiciliati in strainatate pentru ca a relaxat presiunea asupra euro insa ne ingrijoreaza cresterea celorlalte costuri care ne pot afecta in a doua parte a anului

5080317 plaintiffs argue that the guidelines do not remedy this constitutional defect and thus also unconstitutionally compel speech
5080318 the court agrees while the guidelines may or may not provide an adequate alternate channel for plaintiffs to express their views regarding prostitution the clause requiring plaintiffs to adopt the governments view regarding the legalization of prostitution remains intact plaintiffs are still not permitted to abstain from taking a view with regard to prostitution but rather are required to espouse the governments position because the guidelines do not alter the compelled speech provision of the policy requirement the court finds for the same reasons as stated in aosi i that the provision unconstitutionally compels speech therefore plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success to warrant the extention of the preliminary injunction ordered in aosi i
5080319 tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
5080320 and i dont think that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5080321 given its long pro life history do you really think that the republican party would accept a pro choice running mate
5080322 he is also passionately a believer that the republican party must have a big tent and i think frankly what he was just saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me and theres no doubt in my mind no doubt whatsoever that he would have a strong pro life administration
5080323 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever john decision makes

5080332 due parole da un vecchio amico che continua a cercarti nei tuoi scritti
5080333 how long do you think youll have to wait now
5080334 dont let it worry you just yet it could be a while
5080335 but i am worried i mean what if something happens to you
5080336 whats going to happen to me the worst that can happen is that they throw me straight back in here
5080337 well dont worry about me okay you need to be more worried about yourself once youre in here alone
5080338 youre listening to me right you know better than i do how dangerous some of the girls in here are theyll eat you alive given half the chance some of them literally
5080339 go wash your face and use the toilet if you need to
5080340 hey dont look at me like that fujimoto ive given you guys an extra three minutes out here with your buddies
5080341 oh dear have a bit of an accident did we
5080342 yeah i believe in jesus but if god is like what i heard growing up i dont want anything to do with him because all it seems like to me is that god only about a list of right and wrongs
5080343 what hope do we have of changing our false presuppositions about god if we are so blind that we dont see them
5080344 we are utterly ruined he changes the portion of my people how he removes it from me
5080345 this is my land and no one can take it from me it is my right to own it and this is especially true because god gave it to me
5080346 well god can punish us all he wants but at least well always have our land
5080347 do not preach a sermon about punishing us for our sins
5080348 we dont want to listen to any sermons that give us bad news
5080349 you call me teacher and lord and rightly so for that is what i am
5080350 whoever wants to be great must be your servant and whoever wants to be first must be the willing slave of all like the son of man he did not come to be served but to serve and to give up his life as a ransom for many
5080351 the man who loves his life will lose it while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life whoever serves me must follow me and where i am my servant also will be my father will honor the one who serves me
5080352 in some ways we would prefer to hear jesus call to deny father and mother houses and land for the sake of the gospel than his word to wash feet
5080353 in the discipline of service there is also great liberty service allows us to say no to the worlds games of promotion and authority it abolishes our need and desire for a pecking order
5080354 it is one thing to go on the lonely way with dignified heroism but quite another thing if the line mapped out for you by god means being a door mat under other peoples feet
5080355 who then is the faithful and wise servant whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time it will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns i tell you the truth he will put him in charge of all his possessions
5080356 i belong to jesus he must have the right to use me without consulting me
5080357 a natural and understandable hesitancy accompanies any serious discussion of service
5080358 if i do that people will take advantage of me they will walk all over me
5080359 right here we must see the difference between choosing to serve and choosing to be a servant
5080360 self righteous service picks and chooses whom to serve sometimes the low and defenseless are served because that will ensure a humble image true service is indiscriminate in its ministry it has heard the command of jesus
5080361 but suppose the servant says to himself my master is taking a long time in coming and he then begins to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers that servant who knows his masters will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows
5080362 obstinacy and self will will always stab jesus christ it may hurt no one else but it wounds his spirit every time we stand on our rights and insist that this is what we intend to do we vex and grieve his spirit
5080363 the image of slavery may be difficult for us but it was not hard for the apostle paul
5080364 therefore the fear that we will be taken advantage of and stepped on is justified
5080365 nothing disciplines the inordinate desires of the flesh like service and nothing transforms the desires of the flesh like serving in hiddenness the flesh whines against service but screams against hidden service it strains and pulls for honor and recognition it will devise subtle religiously acceptable means to call attention to the service rendered if we stoutly refuse to give in to this lust of the flesh we crucify it every time we crucify the flesh we crucify pride and arrogance
5080366 the spirit of the lord has been given to me for he has anointed me he has sent me to bring the good news to the poor to proclaim liberty to captives and to the blind new sight to set the downtrodden free
5080367 for who is greater the one who is at the table or the one who serves is it not the one who is at the table but i am among you as one who serves
5080368 a student is not above his teacher but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher
5080369 you know that those who are regarded as rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them
5080370 remember the words i spoke to you no servant is greater than his master if they persecuted me they will persecute you also if they obeyed my teaching they will obey yours also

5080386 executives are the ones legally responsible for the companys actions and laws and norms in the field of private pensions come with very harsh penalties in some cases a seven years prison sentence in addition because of the combination of legal responsibility and an almost complete lack of control over the companys operations the position of ceo at a private pension firm is very hard to keep
5080387 if anything goes wrong in terms of operations marketing or the financial side the ceo is the first to be fined or imprisoned irrespective of whether they had anything to do with the offence i wouldnt be surprised to see further pension firm ceos relinquish their positions when they come to realise this

5080399 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5080400 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5080401 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5080405 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5080406 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5080407 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5080408 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5080420 uma homenagem ao camarada ao combatente ao nosso pai que est em havana fidel castro que completou 82 anos eu mandei um presente para ele alguns quadros chegaram eu sei
5080421 non voleva cedere al flusso di ricordi ed emozioni forse provava un senso di lealt verso la propria storia una cosa accennare a unesperienza usarla come riferimento e analogia ma descrivere il fatto orrendo nei dettagli a estranei che annuiranno e dimenticheranno doveva sembrargli un tradimento del proprio dolore
5080422 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5080423 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5080433 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5080434 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5080435 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5080436 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5080437 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5080438 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5080439 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5080440 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5080441 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5080442 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5080443 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5080444 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5080445 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5080446 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5080447 actually i dont agree with that assessment because when al qaeda was in afghanistan they had the partnership of a government
5080448 it now has many of the operational and organizational advantages it once enjoyed across the border in afghanistan albeit on a smaller and less secure scale
5080449 while a major focus of these groups is conducting attacks against nato led coalition forces in afghanistan they provide safe haven to al qaeda fighters collaborate on attacks inside of pakistan and support external operations including against the west
5080450 i cant imagine one single thing we could to that would be more important
5080451 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5080452 this is a planning took where all things are going
5080453 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5080454 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5080455 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5080456 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5080457 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5080458 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5080459 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5080460 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5080461 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5080462 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5080463 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5080464 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5080465 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5080466 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5080467 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5080468 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5080469 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5080470 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5080471 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5080472 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5080473 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5080474 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5080475 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5080476 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5080477 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5080478 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5080479 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5080480 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5080481 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
5080482 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
5080483 it took more than thirty hours of struggle with sending and resending to transmit buchanans equally brief telegram back to the queen
5080484 it reflected the engineering influence of william thomson instead of edward whitehouse and it would not fail the way the whitehouse cable had
5080485 an emergency meeting has taken place at stormont between ministers and relevant agencies in the aftermath of saturdays flooding
5080486 those affected could expect to receive around 1 000 in compensation but the figure has yet to be finalised councils will be notified of the scheme on monday so that people will be able to make applications
5080487 the relevant agencies met on friday after receiving weather warnings as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock
5080488 willing to negotiate if the terms on offer meet his partys requirements
5080489 this executive is incompetent its time they got with doing the job that they were set up to do its a very definite and a very emphatic no
5080490 martin the police did not plant the bomb your former associates did
5080491 he wanted to come round to the house to pay his respects but i didnt want that and we met in the hotel since then we have communicated intermittently over the years and i did meet him with gerry adams and gerry kelly but that meeting was not a terribly good one
5080492 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant
5080493 it would be very hard not to improve any of the london airports wed staff security queues properly and passport controls which are a joke at the moment we have people being delayed one or two hours just to get back into their own country
5080494 this is the new biometric scanner but you havent told me about it
5080495 they put the protection of the killers above the attainment of justice
5080496 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end
5080497 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
5080498 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
5080499 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
5080500 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
5080501 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
5080502 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
5080503 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5080504 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5080505 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5080506 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5080507 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5080508 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5080509 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5080510 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5080511 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5080512 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5080513 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5080514 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5080515 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5080516 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5080517 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5080518 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5080519 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5080520 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5080521 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5080522 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5080523 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5080524 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5080525 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5080526 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5080527 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5080528 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5080529 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5080530 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5080531 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5080532 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5080533 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5080534 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5080535 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5080536 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5080537 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5080538 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5080539 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5080540 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5080541 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5080542 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5080543 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5080544 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5080545 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5080546 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5080547 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5080548 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5080549 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5080550 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5080551 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5080552 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5080553 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5080554 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5080555 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

5080580 jesse just come look at what your brother did here at some point during his time as her father coheed had to mention having a brother named jesse even though he had no direct memories of jesse he did know of jesse and know that they were brothers perhaps even having a photo of him to back up the validity of his implanted memories so its safe to say coheeds children know of jesse being coheeds brother josephine never learned of the virus or the perceived necessity of killing her and the twins so shes very likely extremely upset and angry at being killed by her own father she may not have risen in time to see her parents get taken down and hauled away as we do not know how long of a time gap happened between then and now at this point shes probably still stuck inside her dying body fuming over her death and basically addressing jesse in order to accuse her father and express her anger at him and write me a child like letter pretending lets make this our last day at home by the fence

5080585 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5080586 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5080587 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5080588 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5080589 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5080590 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5080591 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5080592 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5080593 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5080594 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5080595 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5080596 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5080597 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed

5080603 having a second venue allows us to incorporate so many fantastic things
5080604 im a bit allergic to the word festival but i really like the idea of a carnival a summer carnival
5080605 weve brought in a lot of artists that we have found in our travels over the last twelve months weve got a lot of surprises for people this year
5080606 people are going to be surprised at how sexy it is there are no words even though the script is more than 40 pages long
5080607 imagine two djs two separate channels on wireless headphones a thousand people dancing and absolutely no sound apart from the crowd singing along its hilarious to watch and fantastically fun to participate in
5080608 the whole environment is about enjoying live entertainment in an unstructured way and mixing genre when you are a kid going to the carnival is so exiting i really want to make spiegelworld as exciting for a 45 year old as it is for that little 5 year old

5080611 clearly the figures confirm that we are experiencing an extremely tight leasing market tenants are starved of choice for the medium term and many landlords are making the most of their time in the sun by maximising the advantages provided by these conditions
5080612 but the global credit crunch and the demise of 30 new zealand finance companies triggering an unprecedented tightening of development finance means many of these projects will never leave the drawing board in our estimation only 80 000sq m of new space is likely to be available
5080613 it is clear that people have been encouraged to put their money into higher risk investments than was prudent this is a recurring theme for new zealand savers and their advisers who often seem to have trouble distinguishing prime from subprime or blue chip from blue chip
5080614 landlords feeling sorry for themselves might like to reflect that colliers internationals rent indices have shown fantastic growth recently

5080711 i couldnt even race all i could do was ride i couldnt control the bike i didnt feel safe i was riding so slow i felt impotent and ashamed i considered stopping but i stayed out there to get some points we really need a drastic improvement from the tyres
5080712 obviously we are very upset with the performance of our tyres and the results we achieved today
5080713 we have to make a big improvement to our performance at tracks like brno now we will do our maximum to prepare in the best way possible for the next race at misano which is a different track and a different challenge

5080716 are the governments going to provide leadership or are they going to provide management
5080717 they seem very much these days into managing or micro managing the polls
5080718 but i think the community is saying look you to provide the leadership here and they can only provide the leadership if theyve got good advice and thats what we want to give them
5080719 there are experts and there are experts certainly in government groups but what we need is an independent panel thats going to speak without fear or favour

5080722 industria de masini si a echipamentelor de transport detin ponderea cea mai ridicata in comertul extern al romaniei cresterea capacitatii de productie in urma investitiilor realizate pe acest segment contribuie pozitiv la diminuarea treptata a deficitului comercial
5080723 evolutia deficitului comercial in prima jumatate a anului este in opinia mea imbucuratoare vedem o dinamica a exporturilor superioara celei a importurilor si un ritm anual de crestere de 11 3 cu mult sub rata de crestere de 67 inregistrata in aceeasi perioada a anului trecut evolutia este generata si de imbunatatiri structurale la nivelul exporturilor

5080726 legal exista un volum maxim de cherestea care poate fi taiat anual tocmai pentru a limita afacerile de export din acest domeniu in ce priveste comertul cu energie electrica nu este usor sa impui reglementari din moment ce marile companii de energie electrica au facut acorduri pe termen lung cu strainatatea

5080760 the difference between you and everyone else will be how well you execute success is all about great execution

5080770 recrutarea din domeniul it este cu mult mai dificila pentru multi recruiteri decat alte domenii omul din it este flatat si bombardat zilnic cu oferte de job lucru care il face sa devina mai capricios si indecis
5080771 recrutarea in it a inceput sa se maturizeze pe langa faptul ca majoritatea companiilor si au dezvoltat proceduri clare de recrutare nu mai sunt dispuse sa angajeze pe principiul primul venit primul luat asa cum faceau cu ceva timp in urma
5080772 daca in retail sau vanzari pentru un post publicat online poti gasi peste 50 de aplicanti in domeniul it numarul candidaturilor la un job este mult mai redus acest lucru si din cauza numarului mare de oferte din acest domeniu
5080773 sunt persoane care candideaza la peste 5 7 joburi in paralel au chiar si cate doua interviuri pe zi si sfarsesc prin a alege jobul cu oferta salariala cea mai atractiva
5080774 in ultimii ani am investit intensiv in acest proces de branding realizand campanii in mediul online google ads sau yahoo advertorials ori sponsorizand evenimente din lumea web precum roblogfest wurbe dar organizand si evenimente ca flexcamp
5080775 ceea ce vrem sa le transmitem potentialilor angajati este ca in compania noastra vor putea sa ajunga la castiguri mari insa trebuie sa treaca prin niste etape sa ne demonstreze ca vor si ca merita acele castiguri
5080776 de exemplu cel mai mare salariu non managerial este de 5 000 de euro net in zona de implementare a unei aplicatii de tip erp foarte complexe este totusi o exceptie media pentru aceasta pozitie fiind de 2 500 de euro net lunar
5080777 un manager poate castiga intr o companie multinationala mare pana la 5 000 de euro net pe luna in cazul unui manager general insa venitul net poate depasi 10 000 de euro net pe luna
5080778 anual cresterea salariilor din domeniul it inregistrata in tara a fost de 30 40 aceste cresteri foarte mari sunt provocate de criza de specialisti
5080779 cat priveste diferentele salariale intre bucuresti si cluj acestea sunt in continua scadere iar unele functii sunt chiar mai bine platite in regiunea de vest
5080780 acest lucru este foarte bine cunoscut si speculat de unii potentiali candidati de pe piata de it care pluseaza foarte mult si forteaza mana angajatorilor in a le acorda salarii foarte mari care in anumite cazuri nu se justifica prin formarea si experienta angajatului
5080781 industria de it in romania este o industrie de oportunitate acest lucru pentru ca in afara nevoilor curente de forta de munca ea va tinde sa ceara tot mai multi oameni pentru a se consolida si extinde indiferent de numarul de specialisti existenti si pentru ca se va dezumfla intr un ritm extrem de alert atunci cand salariile pentru specialistii din it vor fi la fel de mari in romania ca ale celor din germania de exemplu
5080782 la acest moment industria it din romania in aparenta pare sa aiba un apetit foarte mare si relativ nediscriminator in ceea ce priveste specializarea fie ca e vorba de software development administrare implementare sau hardware
5080783 ca urmare a unor traditii si tendinte in folosirea anumitor softuri gasim o cerere foarte mare de specialisti net ca rezultat al popularitatii crescute a microsoft java oracle sap php dar si o crestere a cererii de specialisti in embedded software
5080784 programatorii raman in continuare foarte cautati desi incep sa se caute tot mai mult programatorii de aplicatii de business scazand un pic cererea celor care fac low programming
5080785 piata din romania este inca tanara in acest domeniu tinand cont ca la noi a inceput sa se faca quality assurance asigurarea calitatii n r in adevaratul sens al cuvantului de aproximativ trei ani un alt factor care ingreuneaza procesul de recrutare pentru aceste roluri este faptul ca cei care debuteaza in cariera pe pozitii de quality assurance qa n r urmaresc ulterior dezvoltarea spre pozitii de software developer si nu aprofundarea cunostintelor de qa
5080786 in cazul seniorilor ritmul de recrutare este cu mult incetinit astfel ca pot sa treaca cateva luni pana sa ajungi sa recrutezi un senior pe o anumita tehnologie
5080787 multe companii de exemplu mentioneaza faptul ca angajeaza programator plus cateva detalii despre pozitia libera dar nu amintesc nimic despre beneficii la modul cel mai direct nimic despre mediul si modul de lucru din companie proiectele dezvoltate sau cele care vor fi in plan ori detalii despre echipa

5080804 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5080805 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5080806 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5080807 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5080808 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

5080812 iran said it had put a dummy satellite into orbit on a home grown rocket for the first time today a move likely to increase western concerns about its nuclear ambitions the ballistic technology used to put satellites into space can also be used for launching weapons although iran says it has no plans to do so
5080813 ministry of defense and armed forces logistics said friday that in presence of president mahmoud ahmadinejad irans safir messenger satellite carrier rocket carrying irans first omid hope satellite was successfully launched into the space tentatively on sunday
5080814 the united states needs to negotiate a new contract with the russian space program which may be difficult because congress must first pass a waiver to a 2000 law banning government contracts with states who supported nuclear programs in north korea and iran that includes you guessed it russia

5080853 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5080854 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5080855 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5080856 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5080857 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5080858 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5080859 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5080860 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5080861 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5080862 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5080863 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5080864 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5080865 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5080866 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5080867 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5080868 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5080869 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5080870 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5080871 winning a medal at the olympic games is one of the hardest things you can do there are a lot of people in this world and youve got to give respect to our athletes who are doing their best out here

5080914 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5080915 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5080916 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5080917 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5080918 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5080919 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5080920 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5080921 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5080922 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5080923 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5080924 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5080925 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5080926 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5080927 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5080928 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5080929 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5080930 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5080931 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5080932 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5080933 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5080934 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5080935 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5080936 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5080937 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5080938 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5080939 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5080940 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5080941 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5080942 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5080943 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5080944 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5080945 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5080946 who are open to doing something on the production side
5080947 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5080948 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5080949 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5080950 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5080951 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5080952 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5080953 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5080954 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5080955 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5080956 when i turned the tv on i saw big shos face right here while in tve channel were reviewing this day in judo hahaha sho was like
5080957 yup u really saw sho not a chinese who looks like him he is there as a olympic reporter
5080958 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognizes this reality and will continue to stand behind georgias democracy and will continue to insist that georgias sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity be respected
5080959 yet again the russian president has given his word and i hope this time he will honor it
5080960 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state that is ready to integrate into international institutions of the political diplomatic security economic kind this forward leaning modern russia that reputation is frankly in tatters
5080961 the russians must respect the entire territorial integrity of georgia and theres only four million people in georgia my friends ive been there its a beautiful little country they are wonderful people
5080962 i think that the basic principle has to be that if we have it within our power to prevent mass killing and genocide and we can work in concert with the international community to prevent it then we should act
5080963 i thought i had a good grasp on the offense the day i got here and i knew a lot about defenses because of my coaches in high school and its just progressed since i got here
5080964 told them turn around and go back on the field
5080965 and he didnt yell or curse the just followed and he then ran practice
5080966 i think weve got five or six kids on the offensive line who i think can play with anybody
5080967 we can have a pretty good football team with them on the offensive line

5080987 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5080988 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato

5080992 we are concerned that more than twice as many young men were admitted as young women which suggests men may be more likely to self medicate with illicit drugs to manage their emotional distress
5080993 many of these admissions may be related to other pre existing mental health problems such as depression or feelings of alienation for which we need much earlier intervention and support when families and others express their concerns
5080994 this bulletin paints a picture of wide discrepancy between the number of men who take are treated or even die from drug use compared to the number of women

5081010 anumiti directori de hr de la noi castiga mai bine fata de cei din strainatate si acest lucru se intampla pentru ca pe plan local exista cateva pozitii cu atributii regionale cu salarii mult mai mari fata de cele ale directorilor de hr locali
5081011 sunt cateva persoane care probabil castiga mai bine decat colegii mei din strainatate
5081012 de cateva ori am facut mapare de talent european in loc sa apelam la companii de head hunting din tara
5081013 un manager bun incearca sa fie proactiv si sa aiba tot timpul o lista de asteptare a viitorilor angajati prin intermediul networking ului personal al oamenilor pe care ii cunoaste pentru ca o pozitie deschisa afecteaza performanta companiei
5081014 pe angajati ii motiveaza managerul nu directorul de resurse umane acesta din urma are interesul sa isi motiveze oamenii lui sa fie un manager operational de succes dar in acelasi timp are ca expert in sisteme de motivare interesul sa transfere sau sa creeze platforme care sa faciliteze celorlalti manageri motivarea angajatilor
5081015 directorii de resurse umane evolueaza pe o plaja larga care il are la o extrema pe directorul de personal pe care il stim de demult iar la cealalta pe directorul de resurse umane modern care este un business partner si care stie suficient de multe despre afacere in asa fel incat sa fie privit ca un partener egal in echipa de management a companiei
5081016 din experienta mea personala stiu ca de la nivelul de director catre director executiv incepe sa se simta elementul de strategie in ceea ce priveste functia de hr insa exista companii unde indiferent de pozitia detinuta in ierarhie omul de resurse umane are numai un rol operational sau de implementare in cele din urma insa pe plan local procentul celor care opereaza ca functie de suport este mult mai mare fata de cei cu valente strategice
5081017 lucrul intr o corporatie multinationala are un dezavantaj faptul ca acestea sunt in general entitati mari cu un anumit grad de sinergie negativa adica unele procese se desfasoara intr un ritm lent din cauza multiplelor niveluri de decizie exista insa si o serie de avantaje ale corporatiei segmentele organizationale mai mici sau mai putin evoluate avand posibilitatea de a beneficia de un set de sisteme si practici care a fost testat in segmentele mature ale corporatiei intrucat orice corporatie are un set de politici care pot fi foarte usor transferate cu mici modificari de la o tara la alta
5081018 in romania cand ai nevoie de niste documente oficiale trebuie sa treci prin patru cinci birouri ca sa primesti o stampila bineinteles corporatia nu lucreaza la nivelul acesta de ineficienta dar are cateva elemente de latenta in sistem
5081019 nu era neaparat vorba de bagajul de cunostinte ci mai mult de profilul individului si atitudinea acestuia fata de munca in prezent este mult mai greu sa gasesti astfel de oameni pentru ca invatamantul a pierdut teren in ultima perioada iar cei mai multi nou intrati in campul muncii urmeaza trasee de cariera
5081020 managerii care vin in training probabil ca s au saturat de ritmul alert din companii unde sunt nevoiti sa lucreze frecvent 12 ore zi de asemenea poate le a ajuns sa aiba zece sefi
5081021 daca esti un trainer bun poti castiga la fel sau chiar mai mult decat un top manager
5081022 acum cativa ani mare parte din cursurile de training erau furnizate de catre companii de profil din strainatate sau existau multe cazuri in care managerii companiilor prezente in romania preferau sa mearga peste hotare sa se formeze profesional
5081023 am lucrat cu mii de manageri romani pana acum si cu foarte putini manageri straini pentru ca acestia nu prea mai sunt pe piata locala
5081024 in urma cu 6 7 ani strainii erau mai degajati mai relaxati pe parcursul cursurilor in timp ce romanii erau mai sobri si foarte incapatanati acum toata lumea e relaxata
5081025 piata locala de training incepe sa se apropie de cea din tarile dezvoltate atat ca tarife cat si din punctul de vedere al serviciilor oferite
5081026 pe tmi telephone doctor si tack vom obtine o cifra de afaceri de 3 5 mil euro in acest an
5081027 tarifele pot ajunge la cateva sute de mii de euro pentru un speaker de asemenea calibru
5081028 in romania ar fi foarte greu sa gasesti sa spunem 20 000 de manageri care sa vrea sa asculte un speaker ar fi o problema si cu spatiul de conferinta
5081029 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5081030 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5081031 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5081032 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5081033 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5081034 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5081035 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5081036 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5081037 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5081038 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5081039 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5081040 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5081041 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5081042 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5081043 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5081044 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5081045 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5081046 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5081047 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5081048 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5081049 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5081050 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5081051 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5081052 i dont know anyone out there who would get tired of playing with venus williams
5081053 we were really focused from the first point we really wanted to win
5081054 we feel like weve contributed to our country in a huge way thats really what its all about

5081062 al qaeda central is often the critical element in turning the hotheads into an actual capable cell
5081063 they have had a darwinian education in what can give them away and their tradecraft has improved as we have eliminated some of the less careful members of their organization
5081064 theyre hiding in a sea of people who are very xenophobic of outsiders so its a very very tough nut to crack
5081065 hey its 60 degrees in florida lets put on a hoodie
5081066 holy mother of goddd i cant stop shaking its so freaking cold i need to be set on fire
5081067 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5081068 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5081069 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5081070 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5081071 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5081072 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5081073 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5081074 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5081075 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5081076 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5081077 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5081078 the most amazing thing is when he finishes a race hes just set a world record and doesnt even look tired
5081079 ive started swimming to be more like phelps so that maybe i can win a medal in motogp
5081080 they should make motorcycle racing an olympic sport otherwise id have been a long distance runner you know im not a quick starter
5081081 well i just hope she rides better than girls drive cars on the street im joking
5081082 arrogant and unable to accept responsibility for their own mistakes
5081083 it was very tough out there and thats all i can really say
5081084 i think it is obvious looking at the lap times where the problems are but im not going to complain about anybody
5081085 it is my job to go out there and do the best job on the package i have got right now and thats what i will do
5081086 i couldnt even race all i could do was ride i couldnt control the bike i didnt feel safe i was riding so slow i felt impotent and ashamed i considered stopping but i stayed out there to get some points we really need a drastic improvement from the tyres
5081087 obviously we are very upset with the performance of our tyres and the results we achieved today
5081088 we have to make a big improvement to our performance at tracks like brno now we will do our maximum to prepare in the best way possible for the next race at misano which is a different track and a different challenge

5081130 we went to lake casitas two years ago i believe on a training trip
5081131 i bottled a couple bottles of the water from there and i brought it all the way over here sprinkled a little bit on everybodys fingers and legs i mean im not superstitious or anything i think the key was hard work but it might have helped a little bit
5081132 before we left princeton we all gathered together at my house and we watched the race it was very inspiring just to see those women be so cool and resilient and just pulling through at the last bit
5081133 thats what we kind of envisioned during the first part of the race where we just wanted to think about us for what we could do i made a call for the 1984 girls and were gonna do them proud and we just started motoring to the finish line
5081134 the first thing you want to do is jump out of the boat and jump out of your skin but you dont have enough energy left to do it
5081135 we knew if we raced a perfect race things were possible
5081136 we kept trying really hard until the end and it feels great
5081137 romania has won the gold medal for so many years and we hoped to do the same
5081138 but theyve just able to focus on what they need to do theyre very professional but the most professional group ive ever worked with no fear they came down smiling to the boat house which was a good sign

5081147 but theyve just able to focus on what they need to do theyre very professional but the most professional group ive ever worked with no fear they came down smiling to the boat house which was a good sign
5081148 it was weird in the first 500 we were up ahead and we were prepared for anything we were prepared to be down prepared to be ahead and nobody turned their head to another boat
5081149 we were streamlined we just looked straight ahead i cant really remember any other boats out there to be honest because it was all about how fast we could go it was the most beautiful peace
5081150 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination thats something i learned and it helped me

5081178 this is one tough smart poet the poems of paul mart nez pompa are gritty and visceral but never cross the line into sensationalism they are poems that vividly evoke the urban world especially chicago without ever lapsing into urban clich they are poems that seek justice for the latino community without ever resorting to the overheated language that all too often consigns poetry of social conscience to oblivion mart nez pompa is a poet of the image a poet of strong diction a poet of meticulous craft he puts that craft at the service of los olvidados the forgotten ones from the usual suspects brutalized by police to factory workers poisoned by their environment from the victim of a homophobic beating in the boys bathroom to the body of juan doe at the cook county coroners office yet this poets keen eye sense of humor and gift for irony help these poems to rise above the wreckage of their circumstances nowhere else will you find a poem celebrating a mexican grandmothers phone call to the local pizza hut mart nez pompas observation of a garbage truck may remind us of williams and his poem about a fire engine his compassion for the damned may bring whitman or hughes to mind paul mart nez pompa however is very much his own man and his own poet independent and honest his is a unique voice speaking the truth with clarity welcome

5081190 weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this
5081191 joe has been a huge part of that you know its just talking to the right people

5081200 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5081201 but i think that some of the companies are open to continued discussions even on relationship grounds and some of the companies dont think its worth their time
5081202 iranian experts who acquired a good know how in setting up power stations and extension of high pressure lines are ready to offer their experience to their iraqi counterparts
5081203 it is a good initiative from a foreign firm to start implementing such a project in the country following the improvement in security
5081204 oh hong kong i see so you are from hong kong
5081205 if you wish to be complete go and sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
5081206 in everything i showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the lord jesus that he himself said it is more blessed to give than to receive
5081207 for you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me
5081208 any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and any city or house divided against itself will not stand

5081225 well there is a cease fire and russia is currently not in compliance with that cease fire although they have just this morning announced that their troops will begin to withdraw and withdraw fully and completely back to the lines prior to this conflict tomorrow on monday
5081226 in fact the fact that russian troops are in georgian cities the fact that they are at the port of poti back and forth in that port along the east west highway is simply not acceptable and it has nothing to do obviously with the conflict that began in south ossetia thats why russian troops need to withdraw fully completely back to their aug t 6 7 lines
5081227 it appeared that they were attempting to drive down the railroad track then they either got stalled or got stuck
5081228 struggling with it they were pulling it up people watched them take off and thats it nobody questioned it they thought i was having the thing repaired i cant believe someone would steal it
5081229 people become more emboldened to steal these materials because theres a financial payoff for it
5081230 to put a guy that mentally unstable in charge of these substances makes me shudder
5081231 but it strengthens our case it shows the security was bad

5081243 una partita entusiasmante marco lattacco ha dato il meglio di s
5081244 hanno subito goal i tifosi non saranno di certo felici
5081245 in campo ci sono ottimi giocatori difficile prevedere chi tra le due squadre avr la meglio
5081246 b non certo il gol pi bello che si sia mai visto ma ogni rete conta vero
5081247 non ha dato chance al portiere tirando con una traiettoria perfetta ha ingannato il portiere e l ha messa in rete
5081248 grandi meriti per la conclusione ma penso che sia stato decisivo il passaggio la
5081249 lattaccante non sar contento gli rimane lurlo strozzato in gola
5081250 e la partita termina con una sconfitta per loro ma penso che dovrebbero essere fieri di loro hanno mostrato del bel calcio
5081251 giallo ritengo sia stato fortunato credo che molti tifosi si aspettassero il rosso
5081252 si staranno chiedendo cosa debbano fare per battere il portiere oggi
5081253 pessimo tentativo aveva tante soluzioni in area a cui passarla
5081254 un tiro assolutamente impreciso anche se il vantaggio di due gol rassicurante i tifosi gradirebbero vedere qualche gol in pi
5081255 entrambe le squadre hanno ancora tempo per portare a casa la partita
5081256 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
5081257 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
5081258 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
5081259 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
5081260 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
5081261 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market
5081262 it is by far the most common cancer we deal with skin cancers account for more than half of all cancers combined but most skin cancers are totally curable
5081263 we need to moisturize otherwise our skin gets dry and we get eczema dermatitis rashes and so on it is too soon to say from this study people should stop moisturizing
5081264 we have just learned about this study and are currently reviewing it to understand the findings
5081265 eucerin original creme has been on the market for more than 100 years and is a highly respected dermatologist recommended brand it has been widely used by both individuals with normal skin and those with diseased skin under the care of physicians and no incidents of this nature have ever been reported
5081266 treatment with vanicream skin cream clearly did not increase the proportion of animals that developed tumors
5081267 the product has been around for 50 years and has no safety issues related to it
5081268 these are skilled workers but their skills were specifically designed for their jobs at medtronic
5081269 they need additional training to help them find new jobs with comparable wages
5081270 weve seen a huge increase in the number of people seeking help
5081271 and i want to get good pay and benefits for my family
5081272 i really wanted to look at all my options before i jumped into something
5081273 i like working with my hands but im getting too old for that
5081274 we recommend people come in while they still have unemployment benefits
5081275 the way that the web has made possible an intimacy with the public that didnt exist 15 years ago
5081276 there are plenty of critics and i am not using that term facetiously i promise who understand a book in precisely the fashion i intended
5081277 a lot of people who are far smarter than i have said things about my books both good and bad that left me humbled
5081278 but you know whats the scary part its almost sold out theres only two boxes left
5081279 cambodia definitely had one of the most advanced music scenes in asia at the time
5081280 it is amazing that a lot of it survived at all
5081281 the khmer rouge destroyed everything related to the music scene they could get their hands on including trashing all the recording studios and destroying all the musical recordings they could find
5081282 when i first heard this music i did not think much of it
5081283 the more i listened the more i realised just how different and edgy this music was
5081284 thailand vietnam and laos did not have this scene it was unique to cambodia
5081285 this exposed cambodian musicians to jimi hendrix phil spector the doors
5081286 meanwhile from europe we got latin styles such as cha cha rumba and flamenco
5081287 in the khmer community in long beach california you cannot go down the street without hearing this music
5081288 for them it was about memories of cambodia in the good times
5081289 i remember seeing the tapes of artists like sisamouth and sereysothea for sale in the phnom penh in the nineties
5081290 i did not really pay any attention to the music until i bought a computer to learn design i stumbled on music editing software and started messing around with sampling khmer music
5081291 soon i was started going out and combing the markets listening to every song i could find from this period and i started to mix and sample them
5081292 the first reaction i had from people was shock they thought it was blasphemy and did not understand why i wanted to do it
5081293 i started remixing old music for fun but now it has become a real mission trying to remind people now just how creative people were back then
5081294 in the next five years we are going to see a real explosion of the arts in cambodia particularly in music
5081295 i hope the pre war songs will be part of that
5081296 if drug cartels can ship up to 10 tons of cocaine in a semi submersible they can clearly ship or rent space to a terrorist organization for a weapon of mass destruction or a high profile terrorist
5081297 men and women heres your chance to play rock star and groupie as you hang at the most famous mansion it will be a true rock star mecca with playmates dressed as naughty school girls free open bar all night amazing buffet strippers in the main rock room the world famous grotto and tours of the mansion grounds all this and more can be had while dancing to the best rock and metal bought to you by metal dj will of knac com later in the night multi platinum singer sebastian bach will rock your ass off performing his hit singles 18 and life i remember you and youth gone wild to name a few stick around as you never know which a list rockstars you will rub elbows with

5081305 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5081306 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century murderface circa 2008
5081307 well yeah its not the best thing but who am i to talk right i mean im just as big a douchebag as putin is
5081308 the primary force that motivates me in striving to keep the chatino language alive is that the language is not just a verbal form of communication
5081309 but rather it is intimately connected with the cultural reality of the chatino people and their complex history dynamic cultural development and diversity with all its own richness
5081310 zapoteco for example is not really one language but rather a family of languages
5081311 the same is true of mixteco and chinanteco and many others
5081312 in mexico indigenous languages are not considered valid for education and for written communication because they are thought of as incomplete and are looked upon as simply dialects or sub languages
5081313 we sampled maize seeds from 870 plants in 125 fields and 18 localities in the state of oaxaca during 2003 and 2004
5081314 we now know that transgenic maize isnt growing in oaxaca
5081315 if transgenic material had got into the community because people were planting imported grain inadvertently then from 2001 onwards the communities were well informed and they knew how to avoid planting grain of unknown origin
5081316 weve done it for centuries we go to oaxaca and other places to sell our work to make a little money to support the family
5081317 even more curious what will end times believers be motivated to do over the next 3 years

5081319 we can confirm that 2 para 2nd battalion the parachute regiment were involved in the incident in which four civilians tragically lost their lives
5081320 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5081321 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safe haven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5081322 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5081323 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5081324 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
5081325 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
5081326 the cult of the presidency americas dangerous devotion to executive power
5081327 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5081328 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5081329 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5081330 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response
5081331 include a clear timetable and specific withdrawal of u s forces to iraq
5081332 do not want to leave custodianship of the item vii to enter into trusteeship again challenge the sovereignty of their country and their liberty
5081333 the main points of the convention on long term security with the americans agreed only that the subsidiary and the details are many and complex can be achieved only by a return to the building authorities sides of the iraqi government u s
5081334 what matters the iraqi government is to inform political decision maker and the iraqi people on the points of the convention and that conditions in the event of rejection or acceptance by the government presented to the political council for national security which represents the various parliamentary blocs as well as committed to non submission to any party outside the boundaries he emphasized that there is no convention between the two sides so far
5081335 must be determined regardless of the ceilings of time in terms of scheduling of the withdrawal u
5081336 the convention is not linked to the election climate local regional or international
5081337 linked to the desire of the iraqi people and their aspirations
5081338 what matters is to inform the iraqi government political decision maker and the iraqi people on the points security agreement being negotiated with the united states stressing that iraq is not linked to the timing timetable for signing the agreement
5081339 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5081340 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5081341 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
5081342 according to recent news reports a top observatory that has been measuring sun spot activity predicts that global temperatures will drop by two degrees over the next 20 years as solar activity slows and the planet drastically cools down they suggest this could potentially herald the onset of a new ice age following the end of the suns most active period in over 11 000 years the last 10 years have displayed a clear cooling trend as temperatures post 1998 leveled out and are now decreasing
5081343 climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climatic change or even to allay its effects they concede that some of the more spectacular solutions proposed such as melting the arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting arctic rivers might create problems far greater than those they solve but the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections of future food supplies the longer the planners delay the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality

5081347 i spent a lot of time checking for a hosting service for our association website and ended up picking dotcanada i was leery at first as i have had other websites with other hosts and lets just say it was a bad experience with a few with dotcanada i was impressed from the start and they have yet to disappoint me i am a programer and site designer by hobby and have other web site projects coming up i know already where those sites will be hosted dotcanada com

5081353 i initially signed up with dotcanada because of the price they were very competitive in this area however upon using the service for some time now i realize they have much stronger points the support is amazing all of my issues have been resolved within minutes there has been planned downtime but in many cases it was aborted due to early resolution of the problem other advantages include a robust control panel which got my up and started right away i feel the control panel could be used from anyone at any level you will be able to install complex php solutions including mysql databases within 5 minutes of activating your account the email hosting to us was almost as important if not more important than the web hosting we have been very pleased with the speed and uptime on the pop3 servers the web mail is also great as dotcanada offers three different choices horde neomail and squirrel one of these is bound to meet your needs if i have not convinced you yet they are a canadian company and it is always good to support businesses in our own backyard

5081379 managerii care vin in training probabil ca s au saturat de ritmul alert din companii unde sunt nevoiti sa lucreze frecvent 12 ore zi de asemenea poate le a ajuns sa aiba zece sefi
5081380 daca esti un trainer bun poti castiga la fel sau chiar mai mult decat un top manager
5081381 acum cativa ani mare parte din cursurile de training erau furnizate de catre companii de profil din strainatate sau existau multe cazuri in care managerii companiilor prezente in romania preferau sa mearga peste hotare sa se formeze profesional
5081382 am lucrat cu mii de manageri romani pana acum si cu foarte putini manageri straini pentru ca acestia nu prea mai sunt pe piata locala

5081392 the key clinical implication is that rheb levels in tumor tissue could indicate patients that will benefit from relatively non toxic therapies with targeted drugs like rapamyicn or inhibitors of the farnesyltransferase enzyme
5081393 our fears regarding these medi cal provider cuts are coming true
5081394 pharmacists have been forced to make the incredibly difficult decisions to turn away patients this has been a real struggle for pharmacists as they have served many of these patients for years and have become like family however some pharmacists have no choice as long as the state reimburses them at 10 20 or 50 or more below actual cost of the drug its not rocket science you cant stay in business if you are losing money on nearly every transaction its a sad situation one that can hopefully be remedied by the courts or through an alternative solution by the legislature
5081395 pharmacists have been encouraged by the support we have received from patients across the state
5081396 if you listed all the petition signatures end to end it would stretch ten miles
5081397 the real tragedy is that many of these patients cannot go for even one day without their medication
5081398 especially those with hiv mental illness or cancer any disruption in care can have long term adverse complications and will result in patients turning to emergency rooms for care or worse which will cost the state far more money than the projected savings from these medi cal cuts

5081401 nu ne punem sperante in bursa pana la sfarsitul anului dar ne ajuta dobanzile la depozitele in lei si cele la titluri de stat pentru cresterea randamentului plasamentelor
5081402 desigur avem portofolii pe bursa locala care sunt pe minus insa clientii respectivi nu au probleme serioase la modul sunt terminat din cauza pierderilor pentru ca au un profil de risc specific cu toleranta mai mare la astfel de evolutii incercam sa i temperam sa nu mai cumpere insa unii sunt adevarati jucatori si nu concep sa se opreasca

5081404 depozitele structurate nu sunt pentru toti desi castigurile pot fi mari trebuie explicate in detaliu riscurile pentru ca in unele cazuri poate aparea perceptia ca este vorba mai degraba de niste pariuri asa cum s a intamplat recent cu produsele lansate de grupul unicredit pe meciurile de la campionatul european de fotbal

5081421 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5081422 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5081423 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5081424 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5081425 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5081437 pues cada partido pol tico tiene sus propias estrategias pol ticas pues uno le tira al otro y busca los personajes para desgastar pol ticamente a su contrincante
5081438 se dice que la derecha trajo a un ex presidente fox y que el ex mandatario habl mal del gobierno actual pero l tendr sus criterios y palabras para poder decirlo que otros lo acusaron de injerencista en nuestra patria pero creo que nuestra gente es muy inteligente
5081439 los nicarag enses todav a no hemos madurado pol ticamente creo que todav a estamos en pa ales y eso hace que busquemos con herir o maltratar al contrincante pol tico
5081440 la vamos a estudiar con nuestros fieles en el p lpito donde llamaremos siempre a esa madurez pol tica que es la que nos hace falta
5081441 el se or al dirigirse a dos ciudades tiro y sid n y los jud os llaman a los paganos perros y el se or para suavizar esa palabra fuerte ahora en el evangelio les dice perritos

5081446 las consecuencias de la crisis en israel las veremos en la segunda mitad de 2008 o incluso en 2009 pero probablemente se dejar n sentir con menos intensidad que en otros pa ses
5081447 porque mientras obtengan beneficios los inversores seguir n poniendo dinero y porque vienen a tel aviv a hacer negocios y apenas tienen contacto con el conflicto
5081448 la fuga de cerebros es muy alta sobre todo en el sector p blico en las universidades o en los hospitales donde los sueldos no son competitivos
5081449 aunque los salarios puedan compararse a los de otros pa ses la carga impositiva es mayor y al final los trabajadores no encuentran los servicios en transporte o medio ambiente que ofrecen los pa ses extranjeros porque aqu hay otras prioridades como el conflicto con los palestinos
5081450 los precios han abandonado el pico de marzo pero siguen un 44 por encima de los de junio de 2007
5081451 cuando los precios sub an mucho ya esper bamos que llegaran a un punto de inflexi n en junio y entonces se calmaran aun as tampoco podemos hablar de una bajada enorme en los precios reales porque la inflaci n est disparada en varios pa ses emergentes tal y como dijimos han abandonado las cotas m s altas pero van a mantenerse en niveles elevados unos a os

5081459 trebuie sa fim foarte atenti pentru ca oricand dezechilibrul in bugetul familial in directia energiei poate sa constranga bugetele destinate iesirii la restaurant in vacanta sau altor categorii de activitati care pot fi taiate de pe lista
5081460 am reusit sa controlam preturile din meniu astfel incat cresterea n red sa se situeze sub inflatia anului trecut si sub cea a prognozei pe anul acesta de respectiv 8 pana la 10 cu toate acestea si cresterea nivelului de trai din romania a determinat un comportament al clientului nostru in schimbare de la an la an datorita acestei evolutii media pe tranzactie este cu 22 mai mare fata de anul trecut
5081461 am reusit sa crestem preturile sub media pietei datorita relatiei solide intre furnizori francizati si noi
5081462 anul acesta am dezvoltat lantul de cafenele city cafe prin preluarea celor doua unitati crem caffe si ne am concentrat pe bucataria mediteraneana respectiv pe lantul buongiorno prin deschiderea celei de a doua locatii in baneasa shopping city cea de a treia unitate urmand sa fie deschisa pana la sfarsitul anului tot intr un centru comercial din bucuresti
5081463 am putut sa intram si in centre comerciale pentru ca ne adresam clasei medii care devine astazi din ce in ce mai puternica avem trei categorii in meniu fructele de mare cu care ne adresam partii superioare a clasei medii si pizza si paste preparate accesibile pentru cei cu venituri medii
5081464 nu ne concentram doar pe gasirea unor potentiale locatii sau pe achizitii ale celor in care suntem deja prezenti in paralel mergem cu hotelul din predeal care este in curs de dezvoltare si ne vom axa pe organizari de evenimente in doua dintre restaurantele noastre cel din piata romana si cel din centrul istoric
5081465 din septembrie vom incepe sa organizam evenimente in cele doua unitati atat in cursul saptamanii cat si in weekend chiar daca activitatea de baza va ramane cea de restaurant pana acum participam doar cu caru cu bere dar am hotarat datorita cererii mari in aceasta directie sa ne extindem
5081466 trebuie sa fim foarte atenti pentru ca oricand dezechilibrul in bugetul familial in directia energiei poate sa constranga bugetele destinate iesirii la restaurant in vacanta sau altor categorii de activitati care pot fi taiate de pe lista inca nu se simte o incetinire a consumului si ne bucuram de fluxul de euro pe care l am primit de la romanii domiciliati in strainatate pentru ca a relaxat presiunea asupra euro insa ne ingrijoreaza cresterea celorlalte costuri care ne pot afecta in a doua parte a anului
5081467 recrutarea din domeniul it este cu mult mai dificila pentru multi recruiteri decat alte domenii omul din it este flatat si bombardat zilnic cu oferte de job lucru care il face sa devina mai capricios si indecis
5081468 recrutarea in it a inceput sa se maturizeze pe langa faptul ca majoritatea companiilor si au dezvoltat proceduri clare de recrutare nu mai sunt dispuse sa angajeze pe principiul primul venit primul luat asa cum faceau cu ceva timp in urma
5081469 daca in retail sau vanzari pentru un post publicat online poti gasi peste 50 de aplicanti in domeniul it numarul candidaturilor la un job este mult mai redus acest lucru si din cauza numarului mare de oferte din acest domeniu
5081470 sunt persoane care candideaza la peste 5 7 joburi in paralel au chiar si cate doua interviuri pe zi si sfarsesc prin a alege jobul cu oferta salariala cea mai atractiva
5081471 in ultimii ani am investit intensiv in acest proces de branding realizand campanii in mediul online google ads sau yahoo advertorials ori sponsorizand evenimente din lumea web precum roblogfest wurbe dar organizand si evenimente ca flexcamp
5081472 ceea ce vrem sa le transmitem potentialilor angajati este ca in compania noastra vor putea sa ajunga la castiguri mari insa trebuie sa treaca prin niste etape sa ne demonstreze ca vor si ca merita acele castiguri
5081473 de exemplu cel mai mare salariu non managerial este de 5 000 de euro net in zona de implementare a unei aplicatii de tip erp foarte complexe este totusi o exceptie media pentru aceasta pozitie fiind de 2 500 de euro net lunar
5081474 un manager poate castiga intr o companie multinationala mare pana la 5 000 de euro net pe luna in cazul unui manager general insa venitul net poate depasi 10 000 de euro net pe luna
5081475 anual cresterea salariilor din domeniul it inregistrata in tara a fost de 30 40 aceste cresteri foarte mari sunt provocate de criza de specialisti
5081476 cat priveste diferentele salariale intre bucuresti si cluj acestea sunt in continua scadere iar unele functii sunt chiar mai bine platite in regiunea de vest
5081477 acest lucru este foarte bine cunoscut si speculat de unii potentiali candidati de pe piata de it care pluseaza foarte mult si forteaza mana angajatorilor in a le acorda salarii foarte mari care in anumite cazuri nu se justifica prin formarea si experienta angajatului
5081478 industria de it in romania este o industrie de oportunitate acest lucru pentru ca in afara nevoilor curente de forta de munca ea va tinde sa ceara tot mai multi oameni pentru a se consolida si extinde indiferent de numarul de specialisti existenti si pentru ca se va dezumfla intr un ritm extrem de alert atunci cand salariile pentru specialistii din it vor fi la fel de mari in romania ca ale celor din germania de exemplu
5081479 la acest moment industria it din romania in aparenta pare sa aiba un apetit foarte mare si relativ nediscriminator in ceea ce priveste specializarea fie ca e vorba de software development administrare implementare sau hardware
5081480 ca urmare a unor traditii si tendinte in folosirea anumitor softuri gasim o cerere foarte mare de specialisti net ca rezultat al popularitatii crescute a microsoft java oracle sap php dar si o crestere a cererii de specialisti in embedded software
5081481 programatorii raman in continuare foarte cautati desi incep sa se caute tot mai mult programatorii de aplicatii de business scazand un pic cererea celor care fac low programming
5081482 piata din romania este inca tanara in acest domeniu tinand cont ca la noi a inceput sa se faca quality assurance asigurarea calitatii n r in adevaratul sens al cuvantului de aproximativ trei ani un alt factor care ingreuneaza procesul de recrutare pentru aceste roluri este faptul ca cei care debuteaza in cariera pe pozitii de quality assurance qa n r urmaresc ulterior dezvoltarea spre pozitii de software developer si nu aprofundarea cunostintelor de qa
5081483 in cazul seniorilor ritmul de recrutare este cu mult incetinit astfel ca pot sa treaca cateva luni pana sa ajungi sa recrutezi un senior pe o anumita tehnologie
5081484 multe companii de exemplu mentioneaza faptul ca angajeaza programator plus cateva detalii despre pozitia libera dar nu amintesc nimic despre beneficii la modul cel mai direct nimic despre mediul si modul de lucru din companie proiectele dezvoltate sau cele care vor fi in plan ori detalii despre echipa
5081485 anumiti directori de hr de la noi castiga mai bine fata de cei din strainatate si acest lucru se intampla pentru ca pe plan local exista cateva pozitii cu atributii regionale cu salarii mult mai mari fata de cele ale directorilor de hr locali
5081486 sunt cateva persoane care probabil castiga mai bine decat colegii mei din strainatate
5081487 de cateva ori am facut mapare de talent european in loc sa apelam la companii de head hunting din tara
5081488 un manager bun incearca sa fie proactiv si sa aiba tot timpul o lista de asteptare a viitorilor angajati prin intermediul networking ului personal al oamenilor pe care ii cunoaste pentru ca o pozitie deschisa afecteaza performanta companiei
5081489 pe angajati ii motiveaza managerul nu directorul de resurse umane acesta din urma are interesul sa isi motiveze oamenii lui sa fie un manager operational de succes dar in acelasi timp are ca expert in sisteme de motivare interesul sa transfere sau sa creeze platforme care sa faciliteze celorlalti manageri motivarea angajatilor
5081490 directorii de resurse umane evolueaza pe o plaja larga care il are la o extrema pe directorul de personal pe care il stim de demult iar la cealalta pe directorul de resurse umane modern care este un business partner si care stie suficient de multe despre afacere in asa fel incat sa fie privit ca un partener egal in echipa de management a companiei
5081491 din experienta mea personala stiu ca de la nivelul de director catre director executiv incepe sa se simta elementul de strategie in ceea ce priveste functia de hr insa exista companii unde indiferent de pozitia detinuta in ierarhie omul de resurse umane are numai un rol operational sau de implementare in cele din urma insa pe plan local procentul celor care opereaza ca functie de suport este mult mai mare fata de cei cu valente strategice
5081492 lucrul intr o corporatie multinationala are un dezavantaj faptul ca acestea sunt in general entitati mari cu un anumit grad de sinergie negativa adica unele procese se desfasoara intr un ritm lent din cauza multiplelor niveluri de decizie exista insa si o serie de avantaje ale corporatiei segmentele organizationale mai mici sau mai putin evoluate avand posibilitatea de a beneficia de un set de sisteme si practici care a fost testat in segmentele mature ale corporatiei intrucat orice corporatie are un set de politici care pot fi foarte usor transferate cu mici modificari de la o tara la alta
5081493 in romania cand ai nevoie de niste documente oficiale trebuie sa treci prin patru cinci birouri ca sa primesti o stampila bineinteles corporatia nu lucreaza la nivelul acesta de ineficienta dar are cateva elemente de latenta in sistem
5081494 nu era neaparat vorba de bagajul de cunostinte ci mai mult de profilul individului si atitudinea acestuia fata de munca in prezent este mult mai greu sa gasesti astfel de oameni pentru ca invatamantul a pierdut teren in ultima perioada iar cei mai multi nou intrati in campul muncii urmeaza trasee de cariera
5081495 jucatorii din alte state vin sa investeasca in romania dar au acces la credite cu dobanda pana la 1 pe 100 de ani si asta pentru ca tarile de unde provin duc o politica de expansiune in ceea ce i priveste pe agricultori transilvania este dominata de unguri de exemplu companii care au primit credite pentru a castiga teren in romania
5081496 if you are anywhere in the lets say 1000 mile diameter area where you can see this thing coming down the light and the heat coming off it would just burn you to death immediately
5081497 so what is humanity doing to address this deadly threat

5081500 it is better to have loved and lost than to have never lost at all
5081501 it was the way i wanted to get gold in some ways this was the best gold medal because there was so much expectation coming into the event and conditions were so difficult
5081502 when i was a kid my generation all looked up to pattisson and we were in awe of what he achieved it seems a little bit surreal to be in the position i am in now pinsent and redgrave are an inspiration to people like myself and it is great when you bump into them along the road just being in the presence of someone like redgrave
5081503 it was fantastic i am so pleased for the girls
5081504 we made a big thing of being a sailing unit and the yngling girls and myself will keep our boats around the place
5081505 we will try to come down and help the rest of the squad to bring back medals
5081506 police and the army exercised restraint in dealing with amarnath protesters in jammu and they should desist from using force against kashmiris as well
5081507 hurriyat and shri amarnath sangarsh samiti spearheading the agitation against revocation of forestland transfer to amarnath shrine board should talk and resolve the land row
5081508 this is the worst thing that has happened kashmiris are being deprived of essential supplies including medicines
5081509 kashmir is a political issue and needs to be addressed politically
5081510 my college roomate is getting married its what you do

5081514 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore ce un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il gioved ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il gioved e un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
5081515 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
5081516 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico ed ora e per me unica al mondo
5081517 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cos importante
5081518 e il tempo che ho perduto per la mia rosa
5081519 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verit ma tu non la devi dimenticare tu diventi responsabile per sempre di quello che hai addomesticato

5081546 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5081547 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5081548 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt

5081550 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5081551 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5081552 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

5081556 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5081557 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5081558 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5081559 rusia nos ha informado acerca de la intenci n que tiene de visitar venezuela es decir de la intenci n de que una flota rusa venga por el caribe

5081567 players will have to pick up health orbs after theyve killed enemies which will restore their health upon contact
5081568 up until fairly recently diablo ii was blizzards best selling game world of warcraft has finally surpassed it but it took it several years to do that and part of the reason is how approachable the game is
5081569 we pulled out the potion system when we wanted to add a hot bar we knew we had to pull the potion stuff out every time we add something we have to pull something out to keep the game very simple and straightforward to play
5081570 when the player has similar downsides it means we can make a lot more interesting monsters we dont have to kill you to challenge you we can make a monster that affects your mobility we can make a monster that has different kinds of attacks that are dangerous to you and that you actually have to avoid and so it makes the combat a lot more interesting
5081571 i think that hardcore players long term will find a game that has lot more depth for them but we distinctly made the choice that in the first stage of difficulty the games really easy so its easy to get through its fun to play and you can kind of spam with one skill but as you get further and further into the game you start having to go okay now ive really got to use this ground stomp thing to stun some monsters and get some distance from them to recover thats something that we focus on more later in the game
5081572 were not saying this is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close
5081573 amore mio non sai quante volte ho sognato che lei stesse distante da noi
5081574 this is the use of religion at its very worst in politics because it is an attempt to subtly and perhaps even subconsciously play on some of the deepest fears of millions of evangelical americans
5081575 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
5081576 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
5081577 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
5081578 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria

5081589 they felt they had to defend the honor of their nation and defend their villages it was a very dangerous dynamic that was part of an action reaction guns of august scenario that we tried to defuse
5081590 its not like a very open and big city and i can tell you that we only targeted the places the governmental organizations
5081591 the bm 21 was designed to attack forces in large areas and as a consequence if you use them in an urban environment the likelihood of collateral damage is high
5081592 its deplorable simply deplorable to fire on civilians like that and illegal
5081593 have to make a judgment in the next little while
5081594 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis
5081595 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
5081596 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

5081602 more people in the world do not have a mobile phone than do have one that only 13 per cent of the world have a computer and the global penetration of broadband is just 4
5081603 there is no such thing as a global consumer there are only local consumers enjoying more and more globally available things
5081604 it was there from the first lap the first turn
5081605 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier

5081608 we are going into every sector we can because cambodia needs every sector to grow
5081609 after that well see in what industry we want to be an asian player
5081610 i think people in macao should be looking here not us looking there
5081611 i am a businessman and just dont have any of that political ambition
5081612 from outside people can make any statement they want but those investors who actually come here realise that cambodia is a place where they should do business
5081613 it might seem strange but i dont think hell ever move from here perhaps its a mix of feng shui good luck and superstition
5081614 im single because when youre a workaholic you dont have time for that he grins mr kith mengs meteoric rise has drawn a mix of envy and disdain from some rival businessmen
5081615 i make joint ventures with international companies not cambodian ones
5081616 in the late 1980s australia was a very discriminatory society
5081617 hey whats the name of that book that im reading that you bought for me
5081618 mr kith meng also has exclusive distribution rights in cambodia
5081619 he was the fattest prisoner that got off the plane

5081623 every time i meet with the women of panjshir i leave with two very distinct feelings
5081624 first i appreciate the freedoms i have as an american second it makes me feel very positive about the way women feel empowered to help with their families and communities
5081625 these women all have great ideas about what can be done to make their villages better
5081626 for instance they talk about the need for power drinking water and schools
5081627 the women talk about wanting to learn skills that will help generate money for their families and villages
5081628 women want to work and little by little theyre being able to
5081629 it cant go below that so wherever it goes above that who knows
5081630 the western art market has existed for 100 years or more but it has been very popular on a national scope since the late 1960s
5081631 any painting that he would send me i would be a phone call away from a buyer
5081632 theyre all about the eastern woodlands indian and those of the great lakes region
5081633 like the indians that were around here the delaware the shawnee all of the iroquois tribes the miami of ohio then when you get up into the great lakes area youve got the ottawa ojibwa and cree
5081634 its something that ive done for a long time and im comfortable with
5081635 i know it well enough now that i can do it with relative ease i dont have to really struggle with how they looked or how they dressed its a lot easier for me to keep in that area that has become my expertise
5081636 when i first went up to santa fe and saw all the western art that was the key
5081637 that was the thing that first put the spark into my head that hey there are people painting indians and making a living at it
5081638 i sold a few of those but they didnt sell out
5081639 i was still working at marc at the time yet i did everything myself here i was packing prints and shipping them out and trying to get a painting done at the same time
5081640 you have to have good source material to work from
5081641 ive got a lot of my own outfits and costumes that i have them wear and sometimes they even wear their own stuff if i use actual re enactors
5081642 just things that i know would have taken place at some point or other
5081643 they may not be an actual historical event but i know that this is something that obviously would have happened
5081644 most of my research in those early days was difficult because there just wasnt anybody doing it
5081645 but when we got into the early 90s we started to see re enactors coming forth re enacting eastern indians some of them were good some not so good but the good ones were helpful because a lot of them did some very good research
5081646 more historians were researching it more stuff was coming to light books were being reprinted documents were being reprinted a couple of books came out including james oneils their bearing is noble and proud for it he gathered all of this narrative as to how they were dressed how they adorned themselves and compiled it into two volumes stuff like that is very helpful
5081647 there are a few early paintings and drawings such as the paintings that benjamin west american neoclassical painter 1738 1820 did that are very detailed even though they are a little glamorized but a lot of the best material is the written descriptions which are given in such detail
5081648 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5081649 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5081650 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5081651 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5081652 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5081653 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5081654 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5081655 this is america man you got to let him play

5081661 words of hope and consolation at the time of death
5081662 beloved saints i will call for the attention of this congregation while i address you on the subject of the dead
5081663 i know that my testimony is true hence when i talk to these mourners what have they lost
5081664 what have we to console us in relation to the dead we have reason to have the greatest hope and consolation for our dead of any people on the earth for we have seen them walk worthily in our midst and seen them sink asleep in the arms of jesus
5081665 you mourners have occasion to rejoice speaking of the death of elder king follett for your husband and father is gone to wait until the resurrection of the dead until the perfection of the remainder for at the resurrection your friend will rise in perfect felicity and go to celestial glory
5081666 i am authorized to say by the authority of the holy ghost that you have no occasion to fear for he is gone to the home of the just
5081667 i have a father brothers children and friends who have gone to a world of spirits they are only absent for a moment they are in the spirit and we shall soon meet again the time will soon arrive when the trumpet shall sound when we depart we shall hail our mothers fathers friends and all whom we love who have fallen asleep in jesus there will be no fear of mobs persecutions or malicious lawsuits and arrests but it will be an eternity of felicity
5081668 they just came too soon emma there was nothing you could do they came too soon
5081669 we have again the warning voice sounded in our midst which shows the uncertainty of human life and in my leisure moments i have meditated upon the subject and asked the question why it is that infants innocent children are taken away from us especially those that seem to be the most intelligent and interesting
5081670 the only difference between the old and young dying is one lives longer in heaven and eternal light and glory than the other and is freed a little sooner from this miserable wicked world notwithstanding all this glory we for a moment lose sight of it and mourn the loss but we do not mourn as those without hope
5081671 a question may be asked will mothers have their children in eternity yes yes mothers you shall have your children for they shall have eternal life for their debt is paid
5081672 children must rise just as they died we can there hail our lovely infants with the same glory the same loveliness in the celestial glory
5081673 joseph smith taught the doctrine that the infant child that was laid away in death would come up in the resurrection as a child and pointing to the mother of a lifeless child he said to her you will have the joy the pleasure and satisfaction of nurturing this child after its resurrection until it reaches the full stature of its spirit
5081674 in 1854 i met with my aunt agnes smith the wife of my uncle don carlos smith who was the mother of that little girl sophronia that joseph smith the prophet was speaking about when he told the mother that she should have the joy the pleasure and the satisfaction of rearing that child after the resurrection until it reached the full stature of its spirit and that it would be a far greater joy than she could possibly have in mortality because she would be free from the sorrow and fear and disabilities of mortal life and she would know more than she could know in this life i met that widow the mother of that child and she told me this circumstance and bore testimony to me that this was what the prophet joseph smith said when he was speaking at the funeral of her little daughter
5081675 he told us that we should receive those children in the morning of the resurrection just as we laid them down in purity and innocence and we should nourish and care for them as their mothers
5081676 we have lost more jews to intermarriage than to the holocaust

5081680 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5081681 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5081682 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5081683 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5081684 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength

5081769 mathura also was a great centre of art and culture during this period here flourished side by side all the important religions of india such as brahmanism jainism and buddhism it is believed that the first buddha images were carved at mathura simultaneously if not earlier with the gandhara school mathura has produced buddha images of various dimensions the kushana buddha or bodhisattva images of mathura served as the prototypes of the more beautiful specimens of the gupta period
5081770 in northwest india in a region that was called gandhara in ancient times and now includes afghanistan and part of the punjab a greco buddhist school of sculpture arose that combined the influence of greek forms and buddhist subject matter it reached the peak of its production in the 2nd century ad although the gandhara style greatly influenced sculptural work in central asia and even in china korea and japan it did not have a major effect in the rest of india it is probable however that the images as well as the symbols of buddha developed at gandhara later spread to mathura now in uttar pradesh where an important school of sculpture developed from the 2nd century bc to the 6th century ad remains of the earlier work of this school also show a close relationship to the style of the sculpture at bharhut later in the 1st and 2nd centuries ad the mathura school discarded the old symbols of buddha and represented him with actual figures this innovation was carried on through subsequent phases of indian sculpture
5081771 in 221 ad the han dynasty came to an end and china broke up into two one was fu nah cambodia there is evidence that the king of fu was in contact with the saka king of mathura mathura was a major kingdom then
5081772 there is also evidence from the edicts of ashoka that he intervened to expel dissident elements from the buddhist order

5081774 ashokas visit to bodh gaya and his devotion to the bodhi tree is shown by a sculpture on the eastern gate at sanchi which represents the emperors visit to the sacred tree it was followed by many other pilgrimages on which both legends and inscriptions throw some light according to northern tradition confirmed by yuan chwang ashokas preceptor in buddhism was upagupta of mathura the son of a performer gupta of benares who took ashoka on an extensive pilgrimage to the principal holy places of buddhism such as lumbini garden where the buddha was born kapilavastu where he renounced the world bodhi tree at gaya where he attained enlightenment isipatana sarnath where he first preached kusinagara where he died sravasti where he mostly lived and taught at each of these places ashoka gave gold and built a chaitya

5081776 love is always patient and kind it is never jealous love is never boastful or conceited it is never rude or selfish it does not take offense and is not resentful love takes no pleasure in other people sins but delights in the truth it is always ready to excuse to trust to hope and to endure whatever comes love does not come to an end

5081778 in the past 150 years each new medium of communication telegraph telephone movies radio television the digital computer the world wide web has introduced its own peculiar mix of written spoken and graphic languages and evoked a chaotic chorus of criticism and celebration but of the changes in the media landscape over the past few centuries those featuring digital media are potentially the most far reaching those of us who grew up in the 1950s at a time when there were just a few computers in the world could never have anticipated the ubiquity of personal computers back then ibms thomas watson famously declared that thered be a market for perhaps five computers in the world a mere half century later more than a billion people can communicate via e mail chat rooms and instant messaging post their views on a blog play games with millions of others worldwide create their own works of art or theater and post them on youtube join political movements and even inhabit buy sell and organize in a virtual reality called second life no wonder the chattering classes cant agree about what this all means heres my take

5081849 i have been having a few good results in a row but i am trying not to pay any attention to the ratings and take it one heat at a time
5081850 i am overwhelmed at the moment and am just going to enjoy and keep having fun in my heats
5081851 if i can make the asp world tour this year i will be just over the moon you get the best waves on that tour and this is what i am thinking about but it is a long way still
5081852 i just made a few critical mistakes in that last heat
5081853 i took off on some waves i should have left and things went his way we had a good heat together and im stoked for nathaniel curran
5081854 i am not looking at any ratings at the moment and just taking the year as it comes
5081855 it is a big result for me but you always want to win when you make a final i am still young lots of events coming up just want to keep surfing well and hope things remain as good
5081856 i wish i could make the final to improve my equal 3rd in the us open of surfing two years ago but i am happy with that run
5081857 i am stoked i could have lost days ago and i am in the final day
5081858 i am happy for nathaniel and we had a great heat together
5081859 it is not like we struggled it all came down to the best surfing we both got the waves we wanted and it went his way in that conditions i am stoked
5081860 i am not thinking of any results points or guys i surf against
5081861 i am already focused on my heat tomorrow in hossegor and it is the most important thing from now on i will be relaxed and take it heat by heat
5081862 i am disappointed i did not make it through that one
5081863 it just did not happen during that semifinal and after such a good week i was hoping to get another chance i just came up short
5081864 i am kind of having a part time year on tour just chosing a couple of events here and there
5081865 it will still be great if i can finish the year in the top 10 i like competing and i feel like it is makable i had some good results in hossegor so i am looking forward to it
5081866 i am pretty bummed because i gave him that last wave that i thought would close out
5081867 it was a big mistake and he got that score in the last seconds which is kind of tough to accpet when you are winning the whole way through
5081868 i had a really tough start in australia this winter and i am really needing results now
5081869 i am happy with the things going on right now but i will be looking for some strong results on both asp world tour and wqs

5081928 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5081929 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5081930 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5081931 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead some shops nearby were damaged he said
5081932 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5081933 we need more officers and we are pulling every lever we can
5081934 a lot of my retirement plan hinges on the deployment cycle and the war on terror as it exists today
5081935 our loss rates are fairly stable and the growth is whats killing us
5081936 there is a tipping point that we have started to reach
5081937 there is a much larger percentage of officers planning to get out right at 20 years and once they are gone they are gone
5081938 we are overworked because of the shortages and have nothing to look forward to but another rotation to afghanistan or iraq so everything weighs towards getting out
5081939 as i look to the future i see the choices i am offered narrowing and the freedom of decision i had start to go away because of the shortages
5081940 i was originally scheduled to get my masters and go teach and that was derailed by deployments that window is gone for me now
5081941 the exodus is expected to continue as more officers are leaving sooner because of the strain multiple deployments are having on families
5081942 the army would prefer to promote officers at a lower rate to encourage high performance
5081943 airports and airlines worldwide are feeling the effects of surging fuel prices and economic uncertainties conditions we expect will likely continue

5081945 we allow in foreign workers and new immigrants because doing so will benefit singaporeans
5081946 our economy has become more vibrant and diversified because of foreign workers

5081948 outside of economics foreign talent also strengthens our ranks in sports so we cannot rely only on local talent

5081970 well whatever whats done is done just keep your mouth shut now okay maybe we can still be friends or something crazy like that

5081989 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price
5081990 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5081991 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5081992 as long as they are not found guilty they remain only accused and there is nothing authorities can do about the couple
5081993 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5081994 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5081995 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5081996 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5081997 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5081998 it is critical that we conclude these negotiations very soon i hope that wise counsel and wisdom will prevail we are fully and firmly committed to the process of dialogue
5081999 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
5082000 russia is considering arming its baltic fleet with nuclear warheads for the first time since the cold war
5082001 look towards washington dc if you want to see true traitors
5082002 we dont like what you are doing to the place
5082003 we hope the release will help strengthen the peace process
5082004 president mahmud abbas had requested the release of very large numbers of prisoners eventually leading to the release of all palestinian prisoners from israeli jails
5082005 whoever engages in dialogue with israel can be boosted through dialogue and not through the use of force
5082006 the kadima labour government continues to liberate hundreds of terrorists without getting anything in exchange
5082007 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5082008 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5082009 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5082010 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5082011 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5082012 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5082013 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5082014 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5082015 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5082016 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5082017 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5082018 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5082019 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5082020 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5082021 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5082022 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5082023 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
5082024 with the help of allah they will make it but i think it will be difficult
5082025 we have to really step it up and make it efficient the idea is that you have good border security but also make it as efficient as possible
5082026 we could have lanes built on the freeway where if you dont want to get stuck in traffic then you go in those lanes and pay the extra money

5082044 i think a lot of guys would like me for a girlfriend
5082045 hey i just moved here i dont know anyone and i need a job but not dancing or stripping
5082046 im going to take off my shirt because thats what guys do before they fight someone because i never do
5082047 im not im just going to teach him a lesson
5082048 i was pleased with the effort of our entire football team they did great work against the cowboys both wednesday and thursday we got a lot of things done especially with our young guys during that second drive today we had a couple penalties and we overcame a few of our mistakes but overall i thought we played extremely hard from start to finish i thought we did better tonight
5082049 to be honest we played really well against them a couple days in a row and i felt pretty good about our run defense i thought we fared well i think we played pretty well against a houston team that will do well this season we made some strides but obviously were not there
5082050 yes we planned on playing them the entire first half i wasnt going to do it after that second drive we wanted to get them in a game situation we got a lot of young people out there we have a new tackle and a new guard out there and we want to build cohesiveness
5082051 ive said that i believe in these guys they have a lot of fight but they dont have a lot of experience so what we have to do is keep on getting guys in there to learn
5082052 hes got exceptional ability and great speed and great quickness you guys saw him the first day he wanted the starting role and he embraced the challenge he has been very consistent in practice and done pretty well in the game
5082053 you can always get better thats why you practice thats why you work you always try to improve jay is going to be hard on himself theres not a lot of perfect games out there so if you think youre perfect youre going to be embarrassed pretty quickly
5082054 were going to do what were going to do jays doing a great job of passing the ball hes doing a good job of spreading the ball around against the dallas cowboys you better be able to throw it because they have an excellent front seven and their safety support is doing well
5082055 te daniel graham had a tight hamstring so he came out after the first series and hopefully theres no setback there and the guys that got banged up during practice were kept out for obvious reasons
5082056 he tweaked his ankle on the opening kickoff he came back later on im not sure how many plays he played
5082057 we had great tempo starting with the offensive line we came in and we did a great job they gave me time we got the running game going
5082058 those guys dallas defensive line run a 3 4 you dont know where theyre coming they have great edge pressure we had the inside zone going and good push up front it all started with those guys denvers offensive line they got the tempo going for us that kept them dallas off balance they gave me some time to throw the ball you got to give those guys some credit
5082059 its a great balance the guy gets knocked around a little bit he was hard to take down you gotta love his attitude out there the running back battle is heating up all of those guys get in there and get the ball and make something happen its good to watch
5082060 we came out and played well as a team and that was the goal we came out and stuck together and put together some good drives and i think we did that today
5082061 we had a scouting report on them because we practiced against them for two days so we knew they were sitting on our routes a little bit it was something we had in our game plan and we came out and executed it
5082062 you kind of have a cheat sheet i got a chance to study the dbs up close and personal it paid off today we played well together we just need to keep building on it
5082063 ever week we have a couple of tricks for our games we didnt show them everything we had but we came out and played well
5082064 it comes from a lot of preparation and having guys around me helping me out brandon marshall brandon stokley keary colbert darrell jackson and the list goes on and on including coach theyre making it real easy for me right now
5082065 its one of those things where we put in the work and it showed tonight
5082066 absolutely you cant forget the other guy over there eddie royal that kid is amazing
5082067 they cant they just have to be fair theyre going to try me early on and theyre going to have to continue to try me im still not proven but im going to continue to punish them

5082172 kinderen moeten de mogelijkheid hebben om uit de levensbeschouwelijke koker van hun ouders en omgeving te stappen neutraal openbaar onderwijs waarin belangrijke levensbeschouwingen aan bod komen maken goed ge nformeerde meningsvorming mogelijk zodat kinderen als zij bijna volwassen zijn zelf kunnen kiezen of zij de religie van hun ouders willen overnemen of niet
5082173 de houding van de overheid tegenover religie zou dezelfde moeten zijn als die de overheid sinds enige jaren inneemt tegenover roken actieve ontmoediging
5082174 neutrale standpunten bestaan niet juist een openbare school werkt met haar seculiere klimaat zodanig op kinderen in dat van een ontvankelijkheid voor levensbeschouwing weinig of niets terecht komt
5082175 ja dat klopt in de praktijk zal dat ertoe leiden dat niet veel mensen vrijwillig kiezen voor een religie
5082176 de kennis die op scholen wordt overgedragen dient wetenschappelijk te zijn als leerlingen aan een onderwijzer es vragen bestaat god dan dient zij hij het wetenschappelijke antwoord te geven er zijn geen wetenschappelijke argumenten te geven voor het bestaan van god het onderwijs dient seculier te zijn dat wil zeggen dat religie zich niet mag mengen met onderwijs seculier onderwijs is geen athe stische indoctrinatie het gaat erom dat onderwijs zo eerlijk en objectief mogelijke kennis overdraagt dus ook over religies
5082177 wat wij echter moeten doen is dit wij moeten het idee van de uiteindelijke bronnen waarneming verstand van onze kennis opgeven en erkennen dat alle kennis menselijk is dat het met onze fouten onze vooroordelen onze dromen en verwachtingen is vermengd

5082211 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5082234 no explosion will take place inside the collider scientists plan to see the processes that took place just after the birth of the universe concerning black holes that appear in the accelerator it must be emphasised that they are micro objects with an extremely short life time and shall cause no harm the life expectancy of these objects is ten to the power minus 17 seconds which is an insignificant time
5082235 the experiment is aimed at studying the nature and mechanisms of the interaction of elementary particles and drawing physical conclusions on nature and what surrounds us especially about the universe and the processes taking place in it the key task at the moment is to understand how elementary particles get their mass and the mass of all matter around us there are other secrets that have to be revealed
5082236 pc recycling the environment and ways to get more technology into the hands of those who need it
5082237 producing the average 53 pound desktop computer and monitor requires 530 pounds of fossil fuels 50 pounds of chemicals and 3300 pounds of water due to the repeated rinsing necessary
5082238 these amounts are roughly the weight of a sport utility vehicle or 1 8 metric tons in contrast the ongoing energy costs associated with owning a computer are relatively low roughly the same as a refrigerator reselling or upgrading computers saves five to 20 times more energy than recycling over the computers life cycle its much better for the environment to use a computer for an extra two or three years than to buy a new one every three to four years

5082242 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5082243 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5082244 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5082245 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5082246 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5082247 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5082248 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5082249 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again

5082582 the mystery of china combined with the unbelievable phenomenon of michael phelps the terrific performances by gymnasts nastia liukin and shawn johnson and defending olympic gold medalists misty may treanor and kerry walsh at beach volleyball have captivated the imagination of the country
5082583 what phelps provided in beijing was more than just sustained excellence he provided the kind of theater that none of us will soon if ever forget
5082584 that is the kind of feat that just may never be surpassed and certainly one of the greatest feats of sports history

5082587 i felt we had a great practice today an extension of what we had yesterday we got a chance to evaluate a lot of our people we got a chance to evaluate them under different conditions and we are very pleased
5082588 usually the second day is always that way it was the same way last year ive probably practiced with a different team seven or eight times since ive been in the national football league and it never changes that second day is usually a bit more competitive and we had some great work
5082589 zach is a great football player i think we all know zach thomas he practices at a certain level and thats why he plays at a certain level every time he hits that football field hes an experienced pro a guy i have always admired and he had a good practice today
5082590 i think both of those guys marshall and cowboys cb adam jones are just having fun there is a lot of respect level there by both guys just going out and competing brandon has a hard time staying quiet though after someone takes a shot at him i do know that
5082591 it wasnt a fight thats was just a little pushing that happens all the time but they kept their composure and they didnt swing thats what you want tempers are going to flare up a little bit thats the nature of this profession but they were professional enough to back off and players laugh at it and smile thats part of practicing against another team but there were no swings and thats what i appreciated two teams acted in a professional manner and hopefully we will have another good practice this afternoon
5082592 they get a chance to see what we are doing and we get a chance to see what they are doing there isnt a gameplan involved but you still want to go out and do a good job you still want to evaluate players as well if we were playing them in a regular season game obviously we wouldnt be practicing against them but thats not they key at this time of year its to try to find your best 53 man squad and also put your system in against other people i think we have had a productive day and a half
5082593 i cant tell you if hes going to play on saturday but its not serious
5082594 i think its a lot different romo was in a backup role i believe for four years if im not mistaken hes a student of the game when you run the scout team or if you are on a team as a quarterback and you have four years looking at different defenses its a little easier to go behind that center and read defenses jay is a little bit different he wasnt thrown in the fire right away in the first year it was a growing experience but there are a little bit more growing pains the quicker you get in romo is reading coverages unbelievably i admire how quickly he reads coverages and gets the ball to the right spot he is going to have a heck of a year you could see it out here today and yesterday
5082595 i see a difference just watching romo play last year he plays with a lot of confidence he knows where the ball is going and if something breaks down he has the ability to make a play on his own he can throw the ball at all different angles and he is a heck of a weapon
5082596 as a team we had a little drop off but you know thats part of playing in the national football league we just got to be more consistent
5082597 basically i said yesterday that 21 is no champ bailey i thought about it for a moment today that since hes changed his name back to adam hes not even pac man hes not even as good as pac man used to be but its all in fun i explained to him that he needed to spice it up because im winning right now
5082598 im aiming for perfection and today i had a little drop off i had a few dropped balls and thats not like me i was kind of upset with myself im always trying to have a pro bowl day every day and today is not one of those days
5082599 yesterday was a little buddy buddy system going on but today was more intense and more physical we got after it today and it was pretty even
5082600 well when you see peyton manning come out and he sees different coverages whether its press or off coverage he changes it up as a defensive back in the nfl you make your money doing press coverage so i said lets go deep we went deep we went 100 percent going deep against pac man jones i mean adam sorry and we won
5082601 its exciting to be able to go against someone else and to be able to go out and compete against another team you got to motivate yourself a little more when you wake up every day going against the same guy today felt like game day a little bit
5082602 definitely when you are going against other guys guys that you are not friends with sometimes tempers flare
5082603 i really cant say what happened i guess two guys got into it a little extra at the end of the play once that happens your friends come and their friends come and pile on just grabbing pushing and tugging away
5082604 i guess yesterday people were feeling each other out we felt that we had the upper hand early in the morning yesterday and we knew they were going to come out with a higher intensity level and they did that we all came out and practiced hard today
5082605 definitely we do that with our own team sometimes when we go against our own team the defense will win and the offense will come out extra motivated because the coaches in the meetings are yelling at you and things like that it makes us want to come out and give that extra effort the next practice
5082606 its kind of hard to tell i am not a db so i am not staring at the quarterback most of the time most of the time i am on man coverage on somebody so i really cant tell you
5082607 he is a very strong runner his speed is a little bit deceptive he is a lot faster than people give him credit for he runs well inside the tackles and outside
5082608 i am just happy to be out there im playing will some downs and mike on others once you start to play linebacker it is really not that big of a difference
5082609 i felt we had a great practice today an extension of what we had yesterday we got a chance to evaluate a lot of our people we got a chance to evaluate them under different conditions and we are very pleased

5082634 khalid bin mahfouz osama bin ladens brother in law and the largest shareholder of bcci who is an important figure within the saudi government with extensive business ties to the bush family and the cia
5082635 agreed to pay a 225 million settlement to pay the banks creditors after being found jointly liable for bccis collapse
5082636 a decade after kerry helped shut the bank down the cia discovered bin laden was among those with accounts at the bank
5082637 at that time i was the u s commerce department official responsible for panama and other latin american countries involved in the drug trade i held a top secret security clearance and read cia reports bluntly describing the banks role in drug money laundering and other illegal activities
5082638 i witnessed how kerry met with opposition in washington from powerful figures in both political parties even president george h w bush whose son george w bush received a 25 million bcci loan for one of his oil businesses pressured kerry to drop the investigation finally the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee democratic sen claiborne pell formally asked kerry to end his probe

5082663 its not a focus for us and i dont think its too much of a focus for him either at the present time
5082664 we just want to generate enough footy into our forward line to give ourselves a chance to kick a big enough score

5082670 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5082671 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5082672 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5082673 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5082674 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5082675 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5082676 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5082677 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5082678 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5082679 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5082680 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5082681 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5082682 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5082683 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it

5082687 mr yang did not continue with his course and left without an award
5082688 we can confirm new evidence has been provided about zhen xing yang
5082689 it suggests he may have gained entry to his ma degree course at newcastle university as a result of producing fraudulent documentation stating he had successfully completed an undergraduate degree
5082690 officers are continuing to work with newcastle university to establish if this information is correct

5082697 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time

5082717 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5082718 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5082719 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5082720 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5082721 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5082722 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5082723 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
5082724 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work

5082744 i do not wish to thumb through that lousy t shirt catalog and share with everyone which t shirt and slogan i feel suits me best
5082745 you can find me on the corner of no bullshit allowed blvd and no fucking way
5082746 i dont need any extra motivation my motivation is to win
5082747 im very proud of my area around the plate i dont want anyone messing with my dirt
5082748 its a yankee world were just falling apart in it
5082749 i think it is too little too late for the yankees to make the playoffs
5082750 if you go down that path you probably wont make the top eight
5082751 sometimes we went out of our way to kick the ball to him
5082752 he played fairly well brendan he started off well and competed hard but if we cant find other players in that front 50
5082753 that was very disappointing that we said maybe play at home a bit more and blokes are maybe worrying about possessions instead of worrying about what they need to do for the team
5082754 that might have taken a bit of pressure off brendan and maybe given us a chance a bit more of hitting the scoreboard
5082755 we need to get better as a team to honour these players
5082756 when someones got three behind their name the opposition starts looking closer
5082757 we were pretty sloppy in first quarter and allowed carlton to kick some easy goals
5082758 we turned over the footy and we havent done that for a while but after we got together at quarter time we re set sail and i thought we were pretty good
5082759 its probably the biggest game weve had for seven years as a footy club and we got comprehensively beaten
5082760 theres no question they are a cut above every team in the competition at the moment by a fair margin i think if they play their best theres no one who will beat them

5082764 we swore if they go ahead with the execution we will exact vengeance from anyone who performs it
5082765 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5082766 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5082767 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5082768 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5082769 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5082770 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5082771 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5082772 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5082773 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5082774 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again

5082782 you love islam and you lived according to islam who did you bring with you in the divine presence for whom did you become a reason for that person to enter into islam did you bring anyone here
5082783 if you stop forbidding people from the wrong ways and asking people to turn their ways to the right way to the way of allah and his prophet sws then allah subhana wa taala will put punishment on you on that nation he will put terror on that nation and then you will beg and you will cry but your prayers will not be accepted
5082784 the more sheytan is disobedient to allah the higher station he gets

5082791 oh nation turn your face this way turn your face this way turn your face to the way of the prophet sws and not to the way that sheytan is showing to you
5082792 my son the whole mankind today have entered into a big truck
5082793 we the awliya are holding that truck from behind for it not to go into the ocean but the power that the engine has is dragging us with it together
5082794 we must know where to let it go if not then the power that the truck has in its engine is going to pull us into that wrong place
5082795 tend to pick up stories from the national enquirer with tongs
5082796 most major news networks took the stance that the rumors of an affair were not newsworthy
5082797 the government is going to help you in the best way possible by doing nothing for you by getting out of your way well i exaggerate but you understand of course we will provide you with infrastructure and help by getting rid of corruption but you have all succeeded by your own initiative and enterprise so you should congratulate yourselves

5082810 its a yankee world were just falling apart in it
5082811 i think it is too little too late for the yankees to make the playoffs
5082812 what we can do is look forward to the future and learn that if we can do it week in week out and to compete with a team like manly the way we did today thats really exciting for the club
5082813 weve just got to learn to do it week in week out thats the challenge for us now
5082814 the disappointing things about the losses that weve had in the last few weeks we really werent in the games because the intensitys just been down
5082815 that was always a good chance of happening it was going to be hard for them
5082816 everybody who watched the game last friday night realised how much manly put into it its always hard to back up particularly when youre playing a team thats not going to be there at the end
5082817 id like to think were a better footy club than that
5082818 im not sure what affected us today but something did we just didnt turn up with the right mindset
5082819 weve just got to think about next week to tell you the truth im not too concerned
5082820 the midges were buzzin i asked you what you did for a living
5082821 hes good in the office but not worth a shit in the shop
5082822 we cannot tell what may happen to us in the strange medley of life but we can decide what happens in us how we take it what we do with it and thats what really counts in the end how we take the raw stuff of life and make it a thing of worth and beauty that is the test of living

5082829 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5082830 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5082831 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5082832 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5082833 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5082834 we have been saying that the im has emerged with this new name but is an old organisation
5082835 the statement has been given by the gujarat police but nothing of this sort had come out in our probe
5082836 as much as interstate wins are difficult you only get four points so what it means is we stay in the eight and weve got destiny in our own control thats what it means
5082837 whats momentum im not being smart but everyone talks about momentum and gee whiz weve one won we just get some confidence back that gee we are a reasonable team
5082838 well i tell you what you cant win finals and play in them until youre in them and we are clearly not in them so that questions irrelevant
5082839 everyone led but in particular at the pointy end riewoldt and lenny hayes were outstanding
5082840 he riewoldt is our captain he plays with presence the bottom line is you need your leaders playing well and he did that today
5082841 he didnt want to have a farewell game himself hes one of those guys that doesnt like the attention of playing the last game
5082842 okay i know that you arent still 25 years old

5082845 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
5082846 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
5082847 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
5082848 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
5082849 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
5082850 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
5082851 we worked extremely hard on that through the acl and tonight didnt concede again so its a positive sign but if you look at the whole round this weekend there werent too many goals scored
5082852 so certainly every team is better structured and if you dont see too many goals this year its not for the lack of effort in front of goals itll be more for the way teams are better structured
5082853 in the a league theres not much between the teams you saw adelaide tonight are a very good side and we gave as good as we got
5082854 they created chances towards the end simply because we were pushing forward the other three games were draws todays game could easily have been a draw as well so its important we go home and try to win next week
5082855 we were disappointed not to take all three points but to come to sydney and feel disappointed like that is a good sign
5082856 wer bin ich dass die mutter meines herrn zu mir kommt
5082857 interpretiert im gegensatz zu den protestantischen kirchen bei denen das zeugnis des heiligen geistes niemals ber das der bibel hinausgehen kann maria so die katholische argumentation nimmt das wort gottes durch einen engel ber das ohr auf der engel antwortete ihr der heilige geist wird ber dich kommen und die kraft des h chsten wird dich berschatten deshalb wird auch das kind heilig und sohn gottes genannt werden lk 1 35 sie tr gt dann das wort gottes das ihr der engel verk ndete in sich und wird zur ehrerweisung die auch menschen erwiesen werden kann z b maria und anderen heiligen und anbetung die nur gott zukommt sie weisen eine von der gottesverehrung losgel ste marienverehrung zur ck zwischen orthodoxen und katholiken sind die unterschiede in diesem punkt geringer allerdings werden die mariendogmen von 1854 leibliche aufnahme mariens in den himmel sprachregelung unter umst nden verehren sie die gottesmutter st rker als gott selbst der so fern und entr ckt scheint dass die menschen gar nicht wissen wie sie mit ihm kommunizieren sollen
5082858 vom heiligendienst wird von den unseren so gelehrt dass man der heiligen gedenken soll damit wir unseren glauben st rken wenn wir sehen wie ihnen gnade widerfahren ist
5082859 l sst diese deutung auch zu andere behaupten aber dass sie unwahrscheinlich erscheine da es im griechischen ein eigenes wort f r vettern
5082860 lediglich m glich aber keinesfalls zwingend und auch nicht allgemein blich gewesen sie verweisen auch auf die bibelstelle geborener sohn marias hei t was f r den uninformierten leser nahe legt dass jesus noch geschwister hatte in der antike waren jedoch mit der m nnl
5082861 wobei nach damaligem wie in der regel heutigem eheverst ndnis dies ausdr cklich den geschlechtsakt mit beinhaltet erscheint es jedoch als u erst wahrscheinlich dass es zum vollzug der ehe zwischen den beiden kam
5082862 zudem erkannte er dass das johannesevangelium von theologischen interessen aus gestaltet wurde und f r historische daten zu jesus weniger zuverl ssig als die synoptiker sei

5082943 it is as if the state wants us to die sooner

5082946 according to inter ministerial expert councils the 805 60 of accp liquidators deaths only in 1993 were connected with chernobyl npp accident effects and 532 77 in 1994 respectively
5082947 we heard some rumors but didnt know anything about it
5082948 when i first arrived in chernobyl what struck me and stuck in my memory was the landscape it looked like a beautiful painting when approaching you could see a city far away a forest and a path a river and the churchs dome was shining it was like a painting it remains a memory of my life
5082949 but when we were approaching chernobyl the view was very different we called it a rusty forest it was all burnt it was staggering we couldnt comprehend it it was horrible but then we had to get used to it slowly
5082950 we had no special clothing just a regular military uniform because we were told that there was already no high radiation
5082951 the radiation level was suitable to work for two hours a day so we wore a regular uniform then wed take it off and shake it shower and change only our underwear the next day was the same
5082952 they said we were going to construct a power plant
5082953 we didnt know what kind of plant it was they said youll go to the samara region and we left the next day only in samara did we learn that chernobyl was our destination some 80 percent of us protested but our commanders said we would be punished as deserters if we left they threatened us
5082954 there are 1 650 children born from the liquidators of them 15 percent are badly sick and disabled our task is to address their social needs and also provide medical assistance lack of medicine is a big problem many chernobyl liquidators die many of them and their children are sick

5082995 yet despite the negative consequences we found many are deliberately taking these substances to achieve quite specific sexual effects
5082996 when it comes to drugs and alcohol young people learn from us the adults who help determine the culture in which young people are learning about sex and learning about drugs and alcohol
5082997 sex and relationships education also needs to include more discussion about the association between alcohol drugs and unsafe sex

5083055 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5083056 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5083057 we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture
5083058 in the spirit of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so
5083059 went against party loyalty and maybe even against your own best interest for the good of america
5083060 well ill give you an example that in fact i worked with john mccain on
5083061 and that was the issue of campaign ethics reform and finance reform
5083062 my knowledge and my background told me that a few hundred marines in a situation like that could not successfully carry out any kind of peacekeeping mission and i thought they were going into harms way
5083063 what would be the greatest moral failure in your life and what would be the greatest moral failure of america
5083064 the failure of my first marriage its my greatest moral failure
5083065 he could have avoided that altogether or come up with some other answer
5083066 but he very quickly cleanly and clearly confessed his failure
5083067 the clarity of confessing his failure there will be respect in the evangelical community for doing so
5083068 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5083069 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5083070 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5083071 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5083072 okay we dont have to go longer on that one
5083073 abortion and marriage are still pivotal issues but i think that abortion is probably more pivotal than marriage
5083074 abortion is still very very solid with this group even the younger ones who are more liberal on marriage life is a real delineating factor
5083075 i thought sen obamas statement in quoting matthew 25 which is my favorite scripture since i was in high school whatever you do to the least of my brethren you do likewise to me when as a matter of record he voted against a ban on partial birth abortion well i find it discouraging and disingenuous for him to talk about the least of our brethren

5083157 if any leader breathing today embodies the ambitions and character of his people its putin hes not a soviet ideologue putins a russian nationalist he wouldve been as at home in the age of peter the great as in our time putin is russia he doesnt just come from the kgb but from a long unbroken line stretching from ivan the terribles proto gestapo the oprichniki through the czarist okhrana secret police down to the nkvd kgb and now fsb hard headed in practice he manifests a mystical belief in russias destiny and he has no reservations about fulfilling that destiny by any means necessary this was the week that russia changed the world
5083158 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5083159 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5083160 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5083161 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5083162 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5083163 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5083164 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5083165 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5083166 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5083167 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5083168 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5083169 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5083170 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5083171 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5083172 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5083173 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5083174 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5083175 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5083176 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5083177 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5083178 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5083179 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5083180 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5083181 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5083182 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5083183 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5083184 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5083185 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5083186 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5083187 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5083188 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5083189 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5083190 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5083191 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
5083192 we just drove down here all the way from l a were starving we need a table immediately
5083193 well karma gets people who fuck up like that in life
5083194 lions are lazy they let the hyenas do all the work
5083195 33 cents kwh 1 month 8 hours day 100 watts
5083196 we are going to open diplomatic relations with our cuban brothers and their government
5083197 where ever that car stops there will be a trash can

5083219 because americas relations with a host of countries are intricately tied to fannie and freddie
5083220 americans future ability to gain access to credit if foreign companies and governments abandon united states investments home auto and credit card loans will be much more difficult to come by
5083221 trouble at fannie mae and freddie mac stirs concern abroad
5083222 this is their financial system they had demanded paper money federally insured bank deposits and a heavy governmental hand in the distribution of credit and now they have them the populist party might have lost the elections in the hard times of the 1890s but it won the future they got their government controlled money the federal reserve opened for business in 1914 and their government directed credit fannie mae and freddie mac in 1971 they got their pure paper dollar so today the fed can print all the dollars it deems expedient and the unwell federal mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac combine to dominate the business of mortgage origination
5083223 we say in our platform that we believe that the right to coin money and issue money is a function of government those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank and that the government ought to go out of the banking business i stand with jefferson and tell them as he did that the issue of money is a function of the government and that the banks should go out of the governing business w hen we have restored the money of the constitution all other necessary reforms will be possible and until that is done there is no reform that can be accomplished
5083224 the right of the government to issue money is not surrendered to the banks the control over the money so issued is not relinquished by the government
5083225 the federal reserve board can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change either up or down
5083226 this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed
5083227 some people think that the federal reserve banks are united states government institutions
5083228 these twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this country by the bankers who came here from europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our american institutions
5083229 the number of advances wasnt increasing exponentially i hadnt seen as many as i had expected not in any particular area just generally
5083230 that the average individual innovator is having a smaller and smaller impact
5083231 i am in two minds about this biologists have abandoned the idea of progress we just are where we are but humanity is so far in advance of anything that has gone before that it seems to be a qualitative leap
5083232 and i increasingly am persuaded that it is then we will have the technology to deal with it
5083233 torture is a matter that has always been unacceptable beyond discussion lets not pretend those days are passed we now have ticking bomb terrorists and its an empirical fact that every civilised democracy would use torture in those circumstances
5083234 terrorism is a major step backwards in civilisation hitler was a major step backwards sometimes we have to step backwards too to combat such things but progress happens in other areas a generation now growing up may have to accept more security measures and less privacy but in other areas like sexual conduct we are making progress i dont think overall we are making a step back
5083235 the implications are mind blowing civilisation faces the sharpest and perhaps most violent dislocation in recent history
5083236 market based panic will within a few days drive prices skyward
5083237 and the market will become paralysed at prices too high for the wheels of commerce and daily living
5083238 when i first concluded that our greatest scientific achievements will soon be forgotten and our most cherished monuments will crumble to dust
5083239 the following thought experiment frames the problem before us and the essential needs a planetary system of living economies must address
5083240 one morning all six billion wake up with a new awareness their planet is actually a living space ship with a biologically based life support system so overstressed that it is on the verge of collapse
5083241 a few decide to arm themselves kill off as many of their rivals as possible and attempt to secure what they can for themselves
5083242 there is desperate need for a solution that works for all
5083243 the essentials come quickly to mind there must be an immediate reordering of priorities the use of every resource must be optimized to assure the health and physical security of every person with minimal waste the life support system must be restored to full function as quickly as possible everything must be recycled with no release of toxics into the environment there will be no luxuries for the few until the basic needs of all are adequately met
5083244 that was definitely the best feeling putting together the yearbook and managing the students
5083245 it was challenging with all new members teaching everyone but once you get that yearbook in your hand and see all the finished pages its a great feeling
5083246 it was a lot of new learning but it was also very fun
5083247 a lot of times we put together our own layouts and that adds a little more to our design this year we played with color
5083248 im going into accounting and business and would love to work in marketing with computers
5083249 its so much fun designing things and seeing the finished product
5083250 we did recycling every week uptown bell ringing for the salvation army school fundraisers for various charities and went to the childrens hospital in fort wayne
5083251 we gave them teddy bears and coloring books it was always fun seeing their faces
5083252 my mom has always been a leader and id go to meetings with my sisters so ive always been around it
5083253 i helped with planning the activities setting up working the activities and helping the younger girl scouts
5083254 we had a coloring contest and crafts for kids and we had story time the mayor the principal church members and others in the community were there to read to the kids
5083255 it took me a couple months to get everything planned it was a lot of work but the best feeling ever to finish my gold award and be among the top girl scouts in america

5083355 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
5083356 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them

5083359 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
5083360 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
5083361 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
5083362 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
5083363 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
5083364 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5083365 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
5083366 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
5083367 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word

5083396 he had something which was very important in the 1960s he had old record credentials and he had been a legend for years the myth was accessible instantly and he had the music to back it up
5083397 the most important rediscovered folk singer to come out of mississippis delta country the traditional home of negro country blues singers
5083398 warm gentle wistful quietly pulsant and wholly musical the guitar work is stunningly complex
5083399 his performances have the quiet introspective quality of chamber music
5083400 he had a repertoire of about 80 tunes all of them gems he was more of a songster than a blues musician with a near perfect guitar style onstage he would rock back and forth with a little smile very unlike someone like son house he was incredible the storybook grandfather full of wise tales and wonderful stories
5083401 the newport festival wanted to buy john hurt a guitar so he came up to marc silbers fretted instrument shop we showed him a martin oo 42 expensive guitars with pearl inlays and he just went for a simple guild guitar that he picked off the wall it was nothing special not even a great sounding guitar it was very modest just like he was for his studio sessions on vanguard he used my om 45 martin which happened to be an incredible sounding guitar you can hear the difference between those recordings and the live vanguard album that he did with the guild
5083402 mississippi john had recorded way back in the days of intense separatism
5083403 and then all of a sudden he was rediscovered by young white people and he couldnt help but wonder what was going on he never expected that anyone would be listening to his music again especially young white people whom he never thought would be interested in his music he appreciated it though he was very quiet very thoughtful and very sweet he wanted to make sure you were comfortable that you had a cup of coffee
5083404 john went into this when he oughtve been coming out
5083405 he got uncomfortable with people fighting to control his recording
5083406 so he went back home and died in his sleep he came in gently left gently
5083407 well i didnt do that as well as i would have liked but this doesnt make me incompetent

5083412 some of the threats that uc faces are open architecture on voice over internet protocol voip software can be exploited for eavesdropping packet spoofing and replay attacks instant messaging a highly vulne rable service has gained popularity not only on business desktops but also on handhelds and smartphones access to emails via uc solutions carrying voice or mail attachments is also highly susceptible to attacks
5083413 attacks are either to bring down a service or hijack a machine for malicious purposes the application is a soft target and there are variety of tools available on the internet to try out various kinds of attacks
5083414 tcp ip based communications has won over all other competing standards today stopping attacks is a reasonably understood science and there are a host of technologies available for this one of them is firewall todays firewalls understand ip protocols so that filtering can be done at the protocol level these are called application level gateways
5083415 most attacks are targeted towards the application this is because a firewall security device would be heavily tested against vulnerabilities as it would be difficult for an attacker to breach these devices the application provider concentrates more on user level features than on security these products would also not go through the same amount of rigour in terms of testing for security
5083416 this has resulted in faster retrieval times near zero latency for inquiries with rcom delivering canned requests for call detail records within seven to 10 minutes in the existing dataset compared with one hour previously

5083426 dios ama todav a al mundo y nos env a a ti y a mi para que seamos su amor y su compasi n por los pobres
5083427 el hombre es creado para alabar honrar y servir a dios nuestro se or y mediante esto salvar su alma
5083428 los no deseados los no amados aquellos de los que nadie se ocupaba
5083429 para gloria de dios y en nombre de los pobres

5083432 uno de los ni os que hab amos acogido fue confiado a una familia muy rica cuenta la m teresa era una familia de la alta sociedad que quer a adoptar a un ni o de corta edad algunos meses despu s o decir que aquel ni o hab a contra do una grave enfermedad y que hab a quedado paral tico me dirig a ver a la familia y les propuse devu lvanme al ni o y se lo cambiar por otro con buena salud preferir a la muerte antes que separarme de este ni o respondi el padre mir ndome con rostro compungido
5083433 lo que m s necesitan los pobres es sentirse necesarios sentirse amados lo que m s les hiere es el estado de exclusi n que su pobreza les impone pues hay remedios y tratamientos para todo tipo de enfermedades pero cuando se es un marginado si no hay manos serviciales y corazones afectuosos no hay esperanza de verdadera curaci n

5083439 en francia como en nueva york y en todas partes cu ntas personas sienten hambre de ser amadas es una pobreza terrible que no tiene comparaci n con la pobreza de los africanos y de los indios lo que cuenta no es cu nto les damos sino el amor con que les damos rezad para que eso comience en vuestra propia familia con frecuencia los ni os no tienen a nadie que les reciba cuando regresan del colegio y cuando se hallan con sus padres es para sentarse ante el televisor sin intercambiar palabra alguna es una pobreza muy profunda deb is trabajar para ganaros la vida de vuestra familia pero deb is tener tambi n el valor de compartir con quien no tiene quiz simplemente una sonrisa o un vaso de agua de pedirle que se siente para hablar durante unos minutos puede que baste con escribir una carta a un enfermo que se encuentre en el hospital y lo mejor es que nos acerquemos a nazaret y que miremos c mo vive la sagrada familia haced de vuestra familia otro nazaret amad a jes s durante el transcurso de la jornada deb is deciros a vosotros mismos jes s est en mi coraz n creo en tu amor tierno hacia m y te amo jes s hay que decirlo y repetirlo constantemente y comprobar is de ese modo que la fuerza el gozo y la paz estar n con vosotros gracias a ese amor que sent s por jes s y podr is amar a los dem s del mismo modo que jes s os ama

5083466 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

5083537 ich bin zwar immer noch traurig dass nun der alte zuschauerraum aus den f nfziger jahren renoviert wird aber bei einem kann es keinen kompromiss geben bei der verbesserung der akustik und der sicht
5083538 ich mochte den k hnen entwurf von klaus roth er war eine historische chance die vergangenheit mit der zukunft zu verbinden
5083539 ive talked more to him in the last week than i have in the last 5 years
5083540 let me get some coffee i think i shld make myself some breakfast now maybe ill come down later to see the boyz
5083541 oh yeah he said he was coming down in case i wanted to come along
5083542 you know our house is just like a big bachelor pad now
5083543 you must not allow boys to be too familiar but be modest and keep them at a respectful distance
5083544 the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the lord how to be holy in body and spirit
5083545 daughters of jerusalem i charge you do not arouse or awaken love
5083546 my greatest moral failing and i am a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5083547 for a minute there it was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that
5083548 the unique status of marriage between a man and a woman
5083549 that doesnt mean people cant enter into legal agreements that doesnt mean that they dont have the right of all citizens
5083550 in the past the republicans took the evangelical vote for granted since their party was in sync with them on the issues of god gays and guns
5083551 this groups agenda has expanded to include issues like the enviroment and poverty
5083552 both candidates meeting with reverend warren and his congregation proves that this year the evangelical vote maybe up for grabs
5083553 mccain may not win without their strong support and obama could win if he does better with them than democrats have done in the past especially if it is a tight race
5083554 we had aspirations for those kind of numbers it was a resounding success
5083555 its sad to know your summers gone worse to know the fall is coming
5083556 i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport without the help of my teammates it wouldnt have been possible
5083557 i dont even know what to feel right now so many emotions i guess i kind of just want to see my mom
5083558 i have no idea i think thats probably the first question i dont know the answer to
5083559 perfecting all parts of it including all of its weaknesses
5083560 the central role played by the murray darling basin in australian agricultural production is unlikely to continue much into the 21st century
5083561 our ability to use less water is going up exponentially every 10 years
5083562 i have no doubt that were in a particularly severe drought in the basin
5083563 to say that the situation were in now will be the norm in the future is not supported by the data
5083564 theres a high range of uncertainty but the majority of models say there will be less water in the south of the basin
5083565 agricultural business will have to adjust to that and i think the drought has accelerated that process of adaptation
5083566 we like most dairy farmers made the decision to sell our water at prices above 1100 per megalitre which enabled us to purchase three tonnes of dry matter per megalitre of water sold
5083567 in the future we will not return to wall to wall perennial pastures that require irrigating throughout the summer instead we will grow more annual crops and store the harvested silage and hay for use later in the year and in future years
5083568 if we did nothing to improve the efficiency of water use then by absolute laws of thermodynamics there will be less production if there is less water
5083569 there is a big margin for increasing water use efficiency economic growth in irrigated agriculture will come from improved efficiencies
5083570 add on the moves to secure water for the environment and the potential impact of climate change on water availability and it seems inevitable that there will be significant adjustment especially in the irrigation sector
5083571 weve been flying blind in the murray darling basin for 210 years because we dont have the data or knowledge to make good decisions
5083572 the issues are that there are different uses for the water and competing needs for that water between irrigators the environment and other uses
5083573 the sustainable yields project is one where we tried to quantify the state of the system in the event of climate change and different future scenarios
5083574 you only have long term sustainable production from any environmental system if it is healthy
5083575 a healthy river and a healthy regional economy are not polar opposites

5083592 we are a small and lonely human race showing no sign of mastering solitude out on this stony planet that we farm
5083593 im going to poland to sign a missile defense agreement in the next couple of days after the nato meeting
5083594 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well
5083595 proud of our ability to stay awake into the wee hours
5083596 there are shortages of workers in many professions and trades these broad consultations with stakeholders have provided us with a picture of the most common and acute pressures across the country and how immigration can play a role in addressing them
5083597 our government is committed to helping newcomers and their families succeed when they come to canada their success is our success
5083598 we cant prioritize occupations and professions in demand if there isnt the necessary support and training available to help newcomers begin work in their chosen fields
5083599 the u s plans to establish a diplomatic presence in tehran for the first time in 28 years as part of a remarkable turnaround in policy by the president george bush
5083600 washington would open a u s interests section in the iranian capital not a full embassy but a halfway house to setting up a full embassy
5083601 irans president mahmoud ahmadinejad indicated earlier this week that he was not against the opening of a u s mission
5083602 we hope the iranian people understand that their leaders need to make a choice between co operation which would bring benefits to all and confrontation which can only lead to further isolation
5083603 very good economic and cultural relations with countries around the world for the continuation of our lives and for progress we do not need the services if i can use the word of a few countries
5083604 in fact two steam generators were stored in italy while the pressure vessel for bushehr 1 was stored in germany
5083605 the first reconstruction and development plan proposed and carried out by president hashemi rafsanjanis government coupled with irans chronic shortage of electricity that went back to the early 1970s and the rapid growth of her population were three major reasons for iran to restart her nuclear program for obtaining electricity
5083606 asking for 5 4 billion in compensation for germanys failure to comply
5083607 the u s was also paid to deliver new fuel and upgrade its power in accordance with a contract signed before the revolution the u s delivered neither the fuel nor returned the billions of dollars payment it had received
5083608 companies race to open new uranium enrichment facilities in u s
5083609 two u s companies general electric and united states enrichment corp or usec along with their european rivals urenco and areva are pushing billions worth of new u s enrichment plants or technology so they do not miss the new uranium boom
5083610 opponents including the union of concerned scientists fear that investment sends the wrong message to countries like iran which is under international pressure to halt its own uranium enrichment efforts the scientists group argues that it is unclear the united states really needs new facilities when it could just import nuclear fuel from elsewhere
5083611 warheads are converted in russia to nuclear fuel and then shipped to the united states
5083612 as enrichment fever grows however the union of concerned scientists in washington is watching with unease because it believes this activity undermines u s credibility with iran
5083613 indias government survived a bruising political battle to win a confidence vote tuesday reviving a landmark nuclear energy deal with the united states that is at the center of an emerging partnership between the worlds two largest democracies
5083614 prime minister manmohan singh and his congress party fought hard to secure victory and appeared to cut back room deals when all else failed an airport was named after one lawmakers father another was promised a high level job and rival politicians allege many others received millions of dollars in bribes
5083615 send a message to the world at large that india is prepared to take its place in the committee of nations
5083616 us president george w bush has approved a cooperation deal with turkey concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy saying that private sector proliferation worries have been addressed the white house has announced
5083617 in my judgment entry into force of the agreement will serve as a strong incentive for turkey to continue its support for nonproliferation objectives and enact future sound nonproliferation policies and practices it will also promote closer political and economic ties with a nato ally and provide the necessary legal framework for us industry to make nuclear exports to turkeys planned civil nuclear sector
5083618 according to the uns nuclear watchdog the international atomic energy agency six organizations operate commercial scale enrichment plants they are china national nuclear corporation cnnc which has two centrifuge plants in china eurodif a joint venture between belgium france italy and spain with one diffusion plant in france minatom the russian state organization with four centrifuge plants japan nuclear fuel limited jnfl with one centrifuge plant urenco a joint venture between companies in germany the netherlands and the uk with centrifuge plants in each of the three countries the united states enrichment corporation usec a us firm with a diffusion plant in kentucky
5083619 both pakistan and india enrich uranium on a smaller scale argentinas enrichment program is said by experts to be more or less dormant
5083620 nations which are signatories to the nuclear non proliferation treaty have the
5083621 however there are three states india israel and pakistan which are known to possess nuclear weapons but have never joined the treaty
5083622 we hope the people understand that their leaders need to make a choice between co operation which would bring benefits to all and confrontation which can only lead to further isolation
5083623 be nice to the people you meet on the way up you will meet them on the way back down
5083624 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5083625 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5083626 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5083627 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5083628 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5083629 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5083630 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5083631 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
5083632 we fought together in the illinois state senate against restricted choice legislation laws just like the federal abortion laws
5083633 which is again contradicted by the assertion that he personally amended the state bill to conform to the federal bill and then voted to kill it anyway an associated press account of the opposition to the bill at the time offers a reason quite apart from roe vs wade
5083634 people are worse off than they were 4 years ago
5083635 being british you know we are used to rain and wind
5083636 were well trained in these sort of conditions winning a gold medal means that you are the best in the world at what you do that feeling is particularly special
5083637 you never let yourself think that it is all over
5083638 but down the last run we had quite a big extension at that moment i just thought chill out and lets get to the finish line
5083639 when paul came along as well that was like a match made in heaven
5083640 mccain also attended the event but he spoke with warren separately
5083641 he talked about what his faith in jesus christ means to him on a daily basis
5083642 the punishment of fading into footnote obscurity a numbered ward of the state he did not destroy
5083643 about 50 metres out i glimpsed to the sides and i smiled then i powered through the line when i crossed the line and saw sherone and kerron there that was the moment and i wouldnt trade it for anything
5083644 i was hoping to run faster in the final but this shows i can do it when it matters
5083645 i gave all i had but i didnt have enough
5083646 it was my best time of the season but thats not saying much
5083647 mum spent wisely fed us well and took part time jobs so she could pay for me and my sister to do various activities such as learning the violin and piano or going to dance and drama clubs
5083648 we learned that these were the valuable things in life not going out and spending money frivolously
5083649 it is very difficult we would have loved to be there supporting her but finances did not permit it
5083650 were absolutely thrilled she had made no secret of the fact that she wanted to get gold and that she had no intention of leaving the games without it
5083651 im just so pleased that she has achieved what she has been striving for she got what she worked so incredibly hard to achieve
5083652 becks is one of those people who needs to win
5083653 she loves to compete and harder on herself basically becks doesnt do silver
5083654 my coach told me just before i was about to race that the girls got silver im gutted for them im totally gutted they deserved to win but it did spur me on
5083655 winning gold was like d day i had to face my demons grit my teeth and ride the best race of my life and i did it
5083656 we swore if they go ahead with the execution we will exact vengeance from anyone who performs it
5083657 os bons tra os que s o inerentes ao car ter de todo judeu tais como compaix o e benevol ncia
5083658 a natureza de algu m que bom beneficiar os outros
5083659 quando se entende mesmo uma pequena parte da ess ncia j se entendeu tudo
5083660 e ele soprou em suas narinas uma alma de vida
5083661 meu dus a alma que tu puseste dentro de mim pura tu a sopraste dentro de mim
5083662 ama a dus caminha em todos os seus caminhos e apega te a ele
5083663 poss vel apegar se divina presen a a shechin certamente a inten o do vers culo instruir nos que aquele que casa sua filha com um s bio de tor ou que faz neg cios com um s bio de tor ou que usa suas posses para beneficiar um s bio de tor considerado pela tor como se ele se apegasse shechin
5083664 ele considerado pela tor como se realmente se apegasse shechin

5083669 estas dez faculdades correspondem s dez sefirot celestiais manifesta es divinas das quais elas desceram
5083670 a faculdade intelectual da alma racional que concebe qualquer assunto chamado chochm que composto de duas palavras
5083671 assim como um filho derivado do c rebro de seu pai assim tamb m a alma de todo judeu derivada do pensamento e sabedoria de dus

5083679 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5083680 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5083681 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5083682 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead he said
5083683 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5083684 i think saudi women ought to be able to participate ive said they ought to be able to vote and i think that when women can vote and are empowered youll see them in the games
5083685 certainly i look forward to the day that theres a saudi woman athlete in that parade
5083686 some events are difficult for us with the clothes events like track and field swimming even football
5083687 das gegenw rtige web ist ein ort des textes und der bilder
5083688 daten sind berall aber der gr te teil davon wird in unzug nglichen datenbanken hinter websites und unter verschluss gehalten
5083689 actually i dont agree with that assessment because when al qaeda was in afghanistan they had the partnership of a government
5083690 they had ready access to international communications ready access to travel and so on their circumstances in the fata federally administered tribal areas and on the pakistani side of the border are much more primitive
5083691 and its much more difficult for them to move around much more difficult for them to communicate
5083692 it now has many of the operational and organizational advantages it once enjoyed across the border in afghanistan albeit on a smaller and less secure scale
5083693 while a major focus of these groups is conducting attacks against nato led coalition forces in afghanistan they provide safe haven to al qaeda fighters collaborate on attacks inside of pakistan and support external operations including against the west
5083694 yeah we just had a tornado with 105 mph winds back home
5083695 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5083696 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time
5083697 that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody laugh
5083698 all people should have the freedom to say what they think
5083699 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
5083700 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
5083701 for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
5083702 free speech zones police arrest them for trespassing or disorderly conduct and then detain them until the president or vice president is out of the area and the media leave
5083703 i have friend who can do this job better than me lets pay them 500 a day to do my job while i make up dress codes and other stupid ideas to justify my
5083704 if ever there want a reason for fighting for a better pay rise you just have to look at these charlatans and how they are screwing our colleagues out of a living just to line their own bottomless pockets and they say its the unions that are holding the country to ransom
5083705 el verdadero modo de vengarse de un enemigo es no parecersele
5083706 las palabras son como las abejas tiene miel y aguijon
5083707 las palabras que no van seguidas de los hechos no sirven para nada
5083708 la discrecion en las palabras vale mas que la elocuencia
5083709 el cambio es una puerta que solo puede abrirse desde adentro
5083710 los que estan siempre de vuelta de todo son los que no han ido nunca a ninguna parte
5083711 cuando hables procura que tus palabras sean mejores que el silencio
5083712 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5083713 when you come in at 500 600 mph drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens
5083714 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
5083715 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
5083716 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
5083717 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
5083718 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
5083719 theyre putting a missile down somebodys chimney and taking out bad guys and the next thing theyre taking their wife out to dinner their kids to school
5083720 a lot of them have told me im glad ive got the hour drive it gives them that whole amount of time to leave it behind
5083721 they get in their bus or car and they go into a zone they say
5083722 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5083723 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5083724 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5083725 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5083726 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5083727 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5083728 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5083729 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5083730 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5083731 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5083732 yall do i have to do the splits im a christian

5083735 i want to kill myself and lee greenwood isnt even on yet
5083736 pardon me sir but that belt buckle is a might bit small dont you think

5083739 it is a pleasure to meet you mark people call me little dead riding hood
5083740 where are you off to all alone in this dangerous forest my dear
5083741 i am off to my grandmothers house to bring her some food my mother and i made
5083742 did you know that there is a patch of jack o lantern mushrooms in the swamp that is ripe for picking i bet they would be just the thing to bring a smile to your grandmothers decomposing face
5083743 its me grandmother little dead riding hood i brought you some tasty goodies and joint cream from the village

5083756 this is in stark contrast to last years pilgrimage where
5083757 va a ayudar porque el presidente carter tiene mucho empuje con los dem cratas
5083758 ha enfrentado a la guerrilla a la violencia al terrorismo en una forma valiente
5083759 si los colombianos saben lo que es bueno si los colombianos quieren el tlc
5083760 the fact that barack did not choose a lighter skinned woman sends a message to me
5083761 when i look at michelle barack doesnt have to be any blacker for me
5083762 white people cant trust barack because he married a black woman
5083763 has any person even once asked themselves if george w bush is the end of white politics
5083764 im the guy who raised the idea in august 2005 but if it doesnt happen our business plan isnt contingent on it
5083765 we are interested in doing it under the right circumstances
5083766 we have to earn a competitive return it has to be done in the right sequence and with the right technology

5083777 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5083778 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5083779 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5083780 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present

5083782 before i used to go out a lot me and my friends we would really go mad in stockholm because its so small you have to create your own fun
5083783 once we dressed up in black hoodies and went out on a saturday night and sprayed graffiti all over town but now im like an old man this is my night off and im cleaning my house
5083784 i decided very early on that when i had the chance to do an album im gonna do it on my own label
5083785 i wanted to be in control of my career and able to do whatever i wanted i just want to be a happy creative person and i want to give back to society and i dont want to go into that whole starve botox yourself shave your head kind of cocaine overdose thing
5083786 i get really scared when people try to judge me already
5083787 because i dont want to be cornered yet this is just the first baby baby steps i took in my artistic career so i just hope people let me do more and do weird stuff as well
5083788 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5083789 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5083790 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5083791 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5083792 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5083793 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5083794 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5083795 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5083796 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5083797 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5083798 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5083799 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5083800 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5083801 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5083802 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5083803 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians

5083807 magnolia allows me to associate multiple openid identities with my account so its easy there but most services have a one to one relationship between identities and accounts
5083808 the main problem i wanted to solve was to allow a user to prove their identity without having to enter a password most mobile devices lack physical alphanumeric keyboards and without that its very hard to fill out password fields my initial approach was to offer an openid url for phone numbers and use an sms message containing a one time password to verify that the person attempting to log in had access to that mobile phone

5083823 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
5083824 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
5083825 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
5083826 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
5083827 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
5083828 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
5083829 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
5083830 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
5083831 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
5083832 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
5083833 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day people may be setting themselves up to have more persistent problems by being stressed and anxious when allergy attacks begin
5083834 a trans caspian gas pipeline can be considered a forever buried chimera

5083836 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5083837 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the us fully recognises this reality
5083838 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5083839 assured that georgians will not continue to use military force
5083840 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5083841 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5083842 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5083843 i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not
5083844 however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5083845 parents who spoil often out of the best of intentions really want to give their children everything without their having to work for it but the world doesnt work that way
5083846 infants cry when they need something and its hard to spoil them because theyre not trying to manipulate or maneuver in infancy you really need to build the feeling that the worlds a safe place
5083847 there is so much questionable parenting literature out there that still talks about spoiling babies that this is a myth that really needs to be addressed
5083848 this is a time kids are differentiating themselves and they do that by saying no
5083849 you serve dinner and the child doesnt want to eat whats on the table so you always have to go out of your way to make a special meal for that child
5083850 if a 5 year old misses a meal it wont hurt him
5083851 for little ones it may be the only way they can express their feelings but in older children tantrums are manipulative
5083852 your child depends on you yes but as they get older children have to learn to be comfortable with other people and with being on their own
5083853 a key warning sign is any child much older than the toddler years who continues to act like a baby or toddler kicking and screaming biting other children not using age appropriate ways of communicating their thoughts and feelings
5083854 this is a sign that theyre not very secure about themselves
5083855 reinforce positive behavior more than you harp on negative behavior

5083861 russia is considering arming its baltic fleet with nuclear warheads for the first time since the cold war
5083862 according to the report under the russian plans nuclear warheads could be supplied to submarines cruisers and fighter bombers of the baltic fleet based in kaliningrad a russian enclave between poland and lithuania
5083863 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
5083864 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
5083865 the sense of alarm may be greatest here in ukraine
5083866 since the orange revolution began in 2004 bringing the pro western viktor yushchenko to power after widespread protests ukraine has been a thorn in moscows side though perhaps not as sharp as the outspoken georgian president mikheil saakashvili
5083867 seen from moscow eyes the attempt of nato to take ukraine or kievan rus the historic heart of slavic russia for almost one thousand years along with russia and belarus was not only militarily a grave threat it was also culturally and economically potentially catastrophic given the distribution of industry and infrastructure between ukraine and russia dating back to the 1930s
5083868 however the proverbial straw that broke the russian camels back was the decision by washington to pursue nuclear missile defense installations in nato members poland and the czech republic
5083869 russia must adequately react to the agreement signed between washington and warsaw on us missile defense shield in polands territory

5083890 everything characteristic about the condition we call modern life has been a direct result of our access to abundant supplies of cheap fossil fuels the age of fossil fuels is about to end there is no replacement for them at hand
5083891 also extremely corrosive it likes to combine with other elements and compounds
5083892 industrial farming dependent on massive oil and gas inputs at gigantic scales of operation can no longer be carried economically
5083893 frankly its not likely is it possible yes just barely
5083894 crass manipulation worthy of a karl rove or an edward bernays
5083895 we can shift behaviors in a matter of months or years
5083896 such an effort would require an enthusiastic participation of the advertising public relations and entertainment industries as well as organized religions and all major political parties
5083897 although the apparent crisis is about terrorism the real one is about energy scarcity an incisive account of the energy issue also explains the real functioning of the worlds economy and who controls it and how this shapes so much of our daily lives
5083898 no one can rationally say that the bush administration is incapable of lying
5083899 can we afford to not question the multitude of contradictions lies falsehoods and cover ups surrounding the events of 9 11
5083900 limits on the one resource that has propelled the human race to over expand and upon which the species is now dependent hydrocarbon energy an increasingly rapid stream of data and experience is ushering in what may be the most significant event in human history the end of the age of oil
5083901 there must be limitless growth into infinity for it to survive growth is not possible without energy there is nothing on our horizon other than wishful thinking that can completely replace hydrocarbon energy
5083902 if demand remains unchanged the world will run out of conventional oil within thirty five years
5083903 electricity is not a primary energy source but merely a carrier of energy produced by some other source
5083904 malthus was certainly correct but cheap oil skewed the equation over the past hundred years while the human race has enjoyed an unprecedented orgy of non renewable condensed solar energy accumulated over eons of prehistory
5083905 it most certainly is on life support and now being sustained by cruelty brute force and lies
5083906 for a 1982 three day orgy of killing and rape at the sabra and shatilla refugee camps that occurred when he led an invasion of lebanon

5083908 many were killed houses were bulldozed and people were left homeless and without food water or medical supplies in areas totally surrounded by israeli defense forces
5083909 a mask over the much graver contradictions of the wests ever growing dependence on the oil resources of nations in the middle east

5083923 i know people and fans have waited for long today after 30 years in the field of cinema and receiving adulation and appreciation i announce that i am joining politics it is an unforgettable moment for me this turn in my life towards politics today i dedicate the rest of my life to praja seva this opportunity to serve people is a blessing and offering from god
5083924 i am accepting the responsibility that people and fans placed on me by wishing that i join politics in the last few months i have travelled a lot and met a number of people some of them are widely respected and revered in this country one such person is dr a p j abdul kalam one meeting with him and the doubts i had on whether to take the plunge or not were eliminated my interaction with him was like a driving force an inspiration
5083925 it is pathetic dr kalam told me youth students and the public in general do not have a good opinion about politics and our political leaders and that is why people like you should join politics dr kalam urged me that was the turning point and i decided to take the plunge
5083926 karan singh has been in touch with the party for quite sometime he has expressed his desire for unconditional entry to the congress we will be happy to have him
5083927 my plan is to wind up the bsp in himachal one of the reasons for congress defeat in november 2007 assembly polls was the bsp it has no base in himachal all those congress leaders who had left the party would be brought back i have left the decision on major mankotias re entry to the high command but for others i will soon be signing the letters
5083928 i have already held a meeting with congress president sonia gandhi now that i have completed touring the tribal areas i will go back to delhi and get the pcc executive reconstituted its going to be a mix of youth and experience thereafter we will start working on the lok sabha poll strategies and give the bjp a tough time
5083929 though this be madness yet there is method in it
5083930 las ff aa para tumbar ya al gobierno nacional porque no sirve para nada
5083931 bolivia deja de ser mendigo y pasa a ser un estado con dignidad
5083932 no es plata de evo morales ni de los prefectos
5083933 esta oligarqu a enferma de aqu todav a me est atacando porque aprobamos unas leyes para qu son las leyes para igualarnos y vuelvo a tomar a bol var bol var dec a nosotros nacemos desiguales y luego vienen las leyes la educaci n la cultura la industria y nos coloca en condiciones de igualdad la igualdad la igualdad la igualdad para eso es el gobierno
5083934 no hay ning n indicio de que estas leyes cambien la estructura distributiva del pa s
5083935 la igualdad hace a los desiguales menos desiguales a trav s de las distintas pol ticas p blicas del gobierno el igualitarismo coloca a todo el mundo en un mismo rasero decidido arbitrariamente por un poder en este caso el gobierno
5083936 ch vez quiere castrar las posibilidades de aspirar del colectivo porque cualquier cosa que genere diferencia pluralidad lo considera subversivo pretende que todos nos conformemos con un m nimo de cosas que da el estado mercal barrio adentro alguna misi n educativa un carrito iran un cupo en d lares
5083937 socialismo significa justicia social e igualdad pero igualdad de derechos de oportunidades no de ingresos igualdad no es igualitarismo este en ltima instancia es tambi n una forma de explotaci n la del buen trabajador por el que no lo es o peor a n por el vago
5083938 a lo mejor el vecino es m s talentoso que yo y aprovecha la educaci n y genera una diferencia entre nosotros eso es inaceptable para el gobierno
5083939 todos tenemos un rasero independientemente del talento bolsitas de mercal un viaje social 400 d lares para compras por internet
5083940 defendamos no la igualdad de oportunidades defendamos la igualdad de condiciones
5083941 muchas de estas leyes sencillamente no se pueden aplicar solamente sirven para tener retaliaciones contra personas o empresas o en particular esa inaplicabilidad conlleva a que la defensa o ataque de las normas se haga sobre la base de categor as abstractas cuando el presidente habla de igualarnos a trav s de las leyes es porque la igualdad es un valor socialista y el gobierno se maneja con categor as que si bien satisfacen su est tica socialista tienen dificultades para aplicarlas
5083942 mucho menos va a funcionar en venezela donde hay ciertos valores como el progreso que forman parte de la conciencia colectiva
5083943 en abstracto los venezolanos quieren la igualdad piensan que los bienes deben estar mejor repartidos pero de all a decir que la idiosincrasia del venezolano es socialista hay un trecho muy grande cuando se les plantea que la forma de alcanzar la igualdad es siendo todos modestos casi muy pobres y que los m s adinerados deben repartir sus bienes entre quienes menos tienen empiezan los conflictos y el colectivo acciona en contra
5083944 el gobierno considera que est lanzando las bases para construir el modelo socialista y las va a ir desarrollando en la medida en que tenga fuerza si sale bien en noviembre con las elecciones de gobernadores y alcaldes avanzar m s en su aplicaci n ahorita seguir con su estrategia de trivializarlas para que pasen por debajo de la mesa pero si salen victoriosos en noviembre avanzar n en ese modelo de igualaci n en un solo rasero
5083945 hacer much simas leyes y cambiarlas en reiteradas oportunidades con el nico fin de ser discrecionales bajo un barniz de legalidad
5083946 el leguleyismo gubernamental es una forma de ocultar cierta dsicrecionalidad
5083947 el tema del hombre nuevo la nueva conciencia socialista la inversi n de los valores es uno de los trasnochos m s grandes que tiene el gobierno
5083948 en la expresi n marxista el plano de la superestructura es lo que importa al gobierno no la infraestructura medios materiales de producci n y eso es lo que no ha podido controlar en su totalidad los elementos representacionales cognoscitivos mentales opin ticos estiman que si logran conquistar la mente de las personas logran instaurar el modelo
5083949 en la posesi n del nuevo presidente de paraguay fernando lugo y luego de intercambiar criterios con algunos presidentes me informaron que el referendo que se vivi bolivia el pasado domingo 10 es calificado como ejemplo democr tico y algo hist rico a nivel internacional
5083950 a nombre del gobierno de manera personal vengo a agradecer a ustedes porque el pasado domingo 10 hemos triunfado no s lo en el mbito nacional sino a nivel internacional
5083951 un presidente me dijo que hab a ganado con el 59 por ciento otro que fue ratificado con el 62 por ciento en latinoam rica pero en sud frica nelson mandela un personaje internacional fue ratificado con 65 por ciento
5083952 hemos logado un r cord con el 67 42 por ciento que nunca antes fue visto en am rica latina y en el mundo

5083976 it could be too much for anyone but not for us
5083977 we were confident we could make it we knew we didnt have time to know each other and practice im a dreamer shes a dreamer larissa wrote me something the other day and put it on the wall in our room everything is possible for us we have been believing in this the last 10 days
5083978 we had kicked each other under the net on that first point the next one she threw me on my butt so thats what i get for celebrating in her face i guess but i really respect her feistiness
5083979 you need at least a month to get ready with a new partner
5083980 i respect what larissa and ana paula have done here we certainly know we have something special this is our eighth season together we know how lucky we are
5083981 you dont know when to say no you need to learn how to say no
5083982 but i said no three months ago in november i said that i had too much on my plate and you just kept giving me more
5083983 qst un addio e neank capisco xk continuo a pensarlo s lui gia mi avr dimenticata
5083984 well all i need is a drink to handle this
5083985 biz lke olarak seni zerre sallam yoruz sen git urada ekicini at atinaya gidince de elinden geleni yapars n
5083986 h oo argada m bu sefer b le vermiyoz bilet
5083987 we are investigating the details of conversation minutes before the incident took place the matter is extremely sensitive since a judge has lodged a complaint and the judiciary is keeping a close eye on the developments
5083988 his statement had some loopholes which were countered by the police he simply failed to convince us and therefore we registered a case under sections 8 and 9 of the prevention of corruption act and criminal conspiracy against bansal prakash and ravinder singh
5083989 the indo us nuclear deal is important for indias energy security and i think the swiss government will most likely support the waiver for new delhi at the nsg meet
5083990 the nuclear deal is good for india and it should be allowed to go through
5083991 it is a decision that has to be taken by the government the parliament has no role to play in it but i am confident that the government will take a favourable stand on the issue
5083992 it is a catch 22 situation whether to allow a mammoth procession in srinagar city or try to halt it
5083993 a free run for the protestors to converge at the un office on a narrow road strip in srinagar city adjoining the sensitive gupkar road which houses top mainstream politicians offices of security agencies and top police and civil administration officers has a serious security dimension
5083994 but if we halt the procession it will mean more killings and then another cycle of protests
5083995 will resign if this current situation continues and the unjustified use of force on unarmed protestors continues
5083996 distress over the excessive use of force against the protestors
5083997 the killing of unarmed civilians and ransacking of properties could not be justified
5083998 the government of india must without any further delay reach out and engage all sections of the society including the leaders of the hurriyat conference in a productive dialogue to resolve the issues
5083999 the government must with political courage revive the peace initiative launched by then prime minister atal bihari vapayee and carried forward by prime minister manmohan singh which had worked well till 2005
5084000 we have been screaming that this problem does not have a military or economic solution it is primarily political
5084001 they the centre though that militancy had gone down and tourism returned and thus everything is fine we had been insisting that the policy of status quo will explode kashmir again and it has happened they dont learn any lessons
5084002 these demands were discussed in working groups framed by prime minister manmohan singh and there was an agreement to implement them why wait
5084003 both prime minister narasimha rao and vajpayee made promises the prime minister said sky is the limit but nothing happened then vajpayee said that his government will not repeat previous mistakes and a solution will be found within the ambit of humanity again nothing concrete happened
5084004 if they the national leadership see the relationship between kashmir and new delhi through money and funds alone then how will they explain the relationship between india and bhutan which is not even a part of our country
5084005 jammu has always been discriminated against there have been one hundred issues where the valley has been favoured over jammu the present issue concerns our aastha faith and is thus non negotiable
5084006 kashmir is the gateway of terrorism to india if you want to save the country you have to strengthen jammu we appeal to the people of india to stand behind the people of jammu
5084007 turning a deaf ear to jammu for the last 50 days
5084008 the modalities are being worked out and we welcome support from all quarters
5084009 the meeting was held at the initiative of swami ramdev
5084010 the yoga exponent was huddled with leaders of the bhagirathi ganga bachao abhiyan meeting and they all promised to take the agitation to various parts of the country
5084011 there will be no let up in the agitation in jammu
5084012 at least one lakh people will court arrest in jammu on monday
5084013 you call me a hardliner and then compare me with syed ali shah geelani the difference however is that geelani burns the tricolour but we get record turnout in jammu to unfurl the tricolour
5084014 the divide in the state is now between the anti national secessionist elements of the valley and the nationalist secular people of jammu whats the harm then if we take the support of the rest of the country
5084015 the struggle of people against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting
5084016 if not for us they themselves would be doing it to us
5084017 they who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security deserve neither liberty or security
5084018 fiction is the effort to be truthful if you want to read fiction then read the los angeles times

5084025 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5084026 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5084027 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5084028 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5084029 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it

5084033 we used to close the book on a friday and come back to work on a tuesday
5084034 one friday the editor got us together and said listen lets change this from race records a lot of people were beginning to find it inappropriate come back with some ideas on tuesday
5084035 one guy said this and one guy said that and i said rhythm and blues and they said oh that sounds pretty good lets do that in the next issue that section came out as rhythm and blues instead of race
5084036 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
5084037 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
5084038 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source
5084039 how could he understand what was inside of black people like that
5084040 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip

5084060 its time to get off the sidelines before it turns into a sellers market and or loan rates go up

5084067 the debate has been brought up with the question of
5084068 a new time poll finds that the most conservative evangelicals are the least enthusiastic about mccains candidacy convincing them that obama does have two horns and a tail might be the best way of getting them to vote
5084069 seal of the antichrist of the united states of america
5084070 obama is probably the antichrist and if you help to elect him by voting for him then you will be partly responsible for the antichrist coming into power

5084134 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5084135 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5084136 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5084137 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5084138 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5084181 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5084182 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5084183 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5084184 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response

5084204 wie met overtollige zonen oorlog wil voeren moet niet alleen eerst de eigen vrouwen monddood maken maar er ook voor zorgen dat de hele seksualiteit in dienst komt te staan van de voortplanting
5084205 i was wondering if i could have a second chance

5084230 in een democratische samenleving moet plaats zijn voor scherpe kritiek op politici en regeringsleiders
5084231 mede door de communautaire moeilijkheden zijn kritische uitlatingen en een verscherpt taalgebruik de politieke kringen en columns binnengeslopen ze zijn wat ze zijn uitingen van frustratie door de politieke impasse
5084232 de niemendalletjes opgetrokken uit onnozelheden bevredigen de commerci le drift maar is dat informeren iedereen heeft nood aan de komkommertijd mensen die kranten lezen journalisten die ze schrijven politici die ze vullen we zijn opgeschreven
5084233 wij vragen meer facts and figures meer verklaring dan interpretatie een scheiding tussen feiten en interpretatie meer pedagogie dan demagogie niet de zoveelste uitvergroting van een triviale karaktermoord smeu g leesvoer dat wel
5084234 wanneer mensen door het huidige systeem van de media getrakteerd worden op infotainment in plaats van op informatie worden zij niet aangesproken op hun nieuwsgierigheid en hun intelligentie maar op hun zucht naar amusement
5084235 genuanceerde berichtgeving leidt onder het domme geweld van mediacoryfee n die zichzelf uitroepen tot opinieleiders managers die zweren bij hoge kijkcijfers voor infantiliserende programmas en winstgevende commercie
5084236 het kale nieuws staat al op internet lang voordat de langzamere media tv kranten de feiten kunnen checken de behoefte aan onderzoeksjournalistiek neemt toe omdat iemand de talloze primaire nieuwsfeiten moet schiften beoordelen of tegenspreken
5084237 de verhoudingen in de media zijn zoek het overgrote deel van de berichtgeving laat het hart van de politieke besluitvorming ongemoeid de europese dimensie van de politiek want daar gaat het om is daardoor voor de meeste mensen terra incognita

5084242 twee permanente leden van de veiligheidsraad china en rusland demonstreren steeds duidelijker hun brute macht en europa staat erbij voor spek en bonen
5084243 vs en westen zullen niet zonder meer een direct conflict aangaan met het opnieuw zeer sterke rusland omwille vd kleine maar strategisch zeer belangrijke republiek georgi
5084244 nu de eurozone potentieel haar eerste volbloed recessie induikt en tanks nog steeds hun nut bewijzen in het duidelijk maken van politieke boodschappen mag toch wel duidelijk worden dat vrede noch welvaart permanente verworvenheden zijn
5084245 vanuit belgisch oogpunt kan dit al te gemakkelijk afgedaan worden als ver van mijn bedshow de decennia van naoorlogse welvaartsexpansie hebben zowat alle huidige generaties op de alleroudste na doen vergeten dat er echt moeilijke tijden kunnen bestaan
5084246 nadat poetin het roer overnam amp het belang van energiebevoorrading rusland een enorme machthefboom en bron van rijkdom gaf wil het land zijn natuurlijke positie als grootmacht weer innemen grootmachten worden nu eenmaal niet graag genegeerd
5084247 kremlin wil veranderde machtverhoudingen onderstrepen vs kunnen dr engagementen in irak amp afgh bondgenoot nt helpen europa is hopeloos afhankelijk van russische energiebevoorrading vn veiligheidsraad is verlamd dr kibbelende grootmachten
5084248 de voortdurende amerikaanse inmenging in de geografische periferie van rusland eiste vanuit het perspectief van moskou dat er een rode lijn wordt getrokken volgens kremlin zijn de russische soldaten in zuid osseti dan ook vredehandhavers
5084249 georgi is n van de frontlijnstaten op het geopolitieke breukvlak tussen rusland en het westen de oorlog in georgi is de voorlopige climax in een machtspel dat al een tijd aan de gang is
5084250 naast economische demografische en technologische vooruitgang is geopolitiek de belangrijkste drijfveer van de internationale politiek waar ambities amp invloed elkaar geografisch overlappen zijn conflicten nooit ver weg

5084267 people and news media tend to focus on what is considered to be controversial rather than focus on the issues that are relevant to a lot of the countries in the region
5084268 a singular focus is not good for anybody and certainly not good for the people that we are trying to be responsible for
5084269 okay zuko and mei are an item because were telling you they are
5084270 if we had met 100 years ago do you think we could have been friends
5084271 well aang isnt my favorite character so i dont want him with katara
5084272 theres a great myth that the republican party has propagated that theyre good for defense better for defense than the democratic party and that theyre good for veterans
5084273 id like to address this last assault on veterans and the benefits that we have promised every man and woman who have served in the armed forces of the united states this senator mccain initiative and comment that he submitted to a town hall meeting that we needed to ration health care to veterans is absolutely bankrupt thinking and i have served with too many soldiers and i have witnessed too many dramas in the soldiers lives and that of their families the last thing we need to do is ration health care under the guise that were only going to give it to men and women who have been injured in direct combat i dont know how you categorize that and define that issue but it does once again back up the bush administrations approach to underfund the veterans administration and to underserve the veterans who have fought so well for this country
5084274 all americans myself included deeply respect sen mccains military service and sacrifice in the vietnam war but most americans would be surprised and disappointed to find out that sen mccain has repeatedly voted against improved health care and benefits for millions of veterans its difficult to understand how during a time of war that sen mccain can support massive tax cuts for exxon mobil and people making over 1 million a year while saying via his votes that we cannot afford to increase funding for veterans health care and benefits
5084275 lifetime voting record from the dav for john mccain is 39 and for barack obama its 89
5084276 i think despite his service distinguished service to our country his political record on veterans has been out of touch and often wrong
5084277 i was in the army for 11 years i was in iraq and afghanistan i was injured in iraq ive been fighting for veterans benefits and veterans rights for a long time sen mccain has a pattern of trying to fix veteran issues by cutting corners plain and simple the webb hagel gi bill is a good example of that sen mccain was opposed to the bill from day one now that bill passed both the house and the senate which is great news under that bill i would be able to go to college while getting a stipend and having the va pay for all of my books all of my labs sen mccain tried to introduce a bill that would have just given the old montgomery gi bill a little bit of a bump and people would have had to stay in service for anywhere from 6 to 12 years to get that
5084278 i have a friend who actually lost his leg in a training incident so if were to ration health care to only combat veterans we would be saying to him that his service where he lost a leg in a training incident where an artillery round went off to close to him his service isnt good enough because he got wounded before he went to combat it wasnt his choice not to go to combat he got wounded in an accident training to go to combat and we cant tell people that just because they didnt go to combat they dont need care its the veterans affairs hospital veterans administration not the combat wounded hospital
5084279 there is a difference as editor between cheering the literary accomplishment of a fiction writer who has delivered a brilliant story about a serial killer or hit man and reading the true account however beautifully written of a young woman raped murdered and forgotten
5084280 brooklyn noir is such a stunningly perfect combination that you cant believe you havent read an anthology like this before but trust me you havent story after story is a revelation filled with the requisite sense of place but also the perfect twists that crime stories demand the writing is flat out superb filled with lines that will sing in your head for a long time to come

5084285 walking around in avalanche country is dicing with death its not only putting yourself at risk its the rescue people involved who are also put at risk
5084286 theres pressure on the hospital but we are managing the best we can
5084287 we very much regret the need to take this action but we must protect our patients from illness and not expose others to illness
5084288 we are very sorry for the inconvenience to our patients and staff
5084289 we will remove the restrictions as soon as the situation is under control

5084294 they are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5084295 just the last couple of days sitting around in a tent watching helicopters go in the wrong direction looking for us not what i went there hoping for
5084296 you can get weather like that in summer you just get more of it in winter
5084297 it was a good time of year for us to go up there and its not crowded with other people
5084298 you know we just dont recognize the most significant moments of our lives while theyre happening back then i thought well therell be other days i didnt realize that that was the only day
5084299 een recht verliest zijn waarde als het buitenproportioneel gebruikt wordt
5084300 daarbuiten of liever daarbinnen oa achter fabrieksmuren van geherstructureerde multinationals is iets vies aan de gang modern times revisited
5084301 de zaak laten rotten t t de bom barst amp een wilde staking 250 000 mensen gijzelt iedereen boos er was geen aanvaardbare verhouding tussen de ernst van de grieven en de berokkende schade stakingsrecht is eerbiedwaardig maar is niet absoluut
5084302 in september zal het bevroren conflict ontdooien en weer tot leven komen leterme omschreef zijn surrogaat ontslag van 14 juli wat grootsprakerig als een kantelmoment in september komen er nog een paar misschien deze keer een paar echte
5084303 de rechtvaardige politieker dient zijn woorden in daden te vertalen en vervolgens zijn daden te verwoorden

5084305 zo gezwind om niet te zeggen overhaast als de regering het licht op groen zet voor de missie van de crem in afghanistan zo tergend lang blijft de onzekerheid voor vele mensen zonder papieren in dit land aanslepen
5084306 dat inspectie financi n de missie onbetaalbaar noemt en dat ze ten koste gaat van middelen voor wederopbouw peu importe de crem dook sinds zijn vliegende start als minister defensie als volleerd gevechtspiloot tss de kritische parlementaire vragen door
5084307 het is niet alleen het federale model dat gefaald heeft maar ook de particratie het model waarin niet de regering en het parlement maar partijen het bestuur en de staat in handen hebben
5084308 er komt even een break in de chronische crisis maar in de herfst barst de etterbuil weer open
5084309 als er iets ernstigs beslist moet worden moet eerst een diepe crisis plaats hebben en als we dan uiteindelijk beslissen beslissen we in schijfjes flinterdunne schijfjes veranderingen vergen jaren en zijn ook maar na jaren zichtbaar
5084310 premier u geeft geld uit dat er niet is u runt dit land met monopolygeld
5084311 u heeft toch goed onthouden wat koning boudewijn wilde en zei
5084312 ps en cdh stonden voor een humane aanpak in het asielbeleid ik wil hen daarvoor kunnen belonen
5084313 er moet een onderhandelde oplossing komen vlamingen die het tegendeel beweren zijn dom of zijn van kwade wil geen zinnig mens wil dat kieskringen ons sociaal model en onze welvaart in de weg staan
5084314 de staatshervorming moet tot doel moet hebben ons sociale model te redden dat kan maar door elk beleidsniveau te versterken en te responsabiliseren zonder die hervorming evolueren we naar een toenemende erosie van ons sociaal model
5084315 2 weken na de crisis die tot ontslag van leterme leidde komt alles dus terug wat hebben we ondertussen gewonnen niets de heren die de oplossing moeten vinden zijn daar voor ongeschikt amp krijgen er de tijd niet voor de echte machthebbers durven niet
5084316 de metafoor over de vette vis is de meest inhoudsloze die ik ooit heb gehoord omdat het niet de vraag is hoe vet de vis is maar welke vis er in de pan ligt en waarom
5084317 dat is nog het meest hallucinante aan de crisis niemand durft nog alleen te staan
5084318 het volk roept ca suffit ook misleiding het volk roept niet het volk slaapt misschien ligt het wat bozig tussen de lakens maar het komt zeker niet met riek amp hooivolk op straat leterme heeft het volk bedwelmd de narcose blijft duren
5084319 3 boksers zonder handschoenen tot grote vreugde vd partijbesturen vd meerderheid stel je toch eens voor dat zij plotseling zouden geconfronteerd worden met een baken van licht amp verzoening waar moeten zij dan heen met hun wellustige balkangevoel
5084320 ervaringsdeskundigen in verzoening horen misschien in zimbabwe thuis maar zeker niet in bhv vuurtje stoken heeft namelijk een verslavend effect
5084321 typisch voor deze amateurs vd ondergang is hun angst voor inmenging van ervaren staatsmannen in het door hen aangerichte imbroglio mannen als verhofstadt dehaene amp van miert worden scrupuleus bij het grof vuil gehouden
5084322 in die collectieve lamlendigheid zijn talentlozen en krijsende wijven aan het bewind gekomen zwaailichten hebben zich ge nstalleerd in de black out van de massa ergo ze hebben hun aanhang ook nog eens misleid
5084323 het volk betaalt nu de prijs voor zijn civieke lamlendigheid het heeft dienstdoende politieke klasse niet genoeg op de hielen gezeten er zijn te weinig piketpalen geheid de natie heeft zich laten ophitsen door kleine rancune van plattelandsfrustraten
5084324 belgi heeft nood aan een nieuw verlicht proletariaat het is er niet en we hebben de leiders er niet voor we hebben berhaupt geen leiders alles is gefragmenteerd het politieke gezag het middenveld het volk
5084325 dat het volk het zo ver heeft laten komen pleit niet voor het volk wij zijn geen haar beter dan de charlatans van de wetstraat wij draaien ook onze eigen rondjes in hebzucht achter gesloten luiken de ander zijn wijzelf
5084326 beschaving is niets anders dan het verlangen naar gedeelde ervaringen napels zien en sterven delen in de parvenustaat die de onze is delen we niet eens het brood dat mag niet meer van vlaamse regenten solide edelmoedigheid vakkundig afgeleerd
5084327 niets van wat de koning op 21 juli kan zeggen heeft betekenis dat was vroeger niet anders maar toen waren we meer maatschappij dan natie we spraken onszelf toe vandaag zijn we geen van beide nog
5084328 valt er in de hitte van de strijd nog altijd iets te relativeren al was het maar de rustige aanblik van het water in de ourthe en de leie
5084329 wat kan koning albert op 21 juli nog zeggen dat we ondanks de mis re van zijn politiek personeel onverminderd in een rococo welfare state leven die tot dankbaarheid stemt
5084330 als u nog iets begrijpt van de belgische politiek dan heeft men het u slecht uitgelegd
5084331 wat we nu beleven zijn belgofollies 3 wijzen moeten op een gouden schaal de mirakeloplossing aanreiken hun echte missie is het kabinet voorbij 25 juli tillen parlement met vakantie tot oktober dat is weer 2 maanden winst daarom zijn het ook wijzen
5084332 thyssen degradeert de gere nstalleerde regering tot kabinet van lopende zaken ongezien in onze geschiedenis amp getuigend van weinig grondwettelijk respect zij gedraagt zich als een koningin men kan nog niet gewagen van staatsgreep maar er is iets van
5084333 het grote vacuum van non beleid moet intussen weggestopt worden achter schijncatastrofes in leterme i heeft de crisis het bestuur vervangen we zien theater dat zelfs geen moeite meer doet zijn burleske trekken te verbergen
5084334 n va matrakkeert cd amp v voortdurend met perceptie in de permanente crisis kan het kartel zijn beginselvastheid tentoonspreiden als het te lang rustig blijft wordt snel de indruk van uitstel en compromissen gewekt
5084335 n va zal nooit deel kunnen uitmaken van een grote staatshervorming een akkoord wordt nog altijd meer afgewogen op zijn toegevingen dan op zijn realisaties cd amp v wil die waarheid niet erkennen waardoor n va in een comfortabele zetel zit
5084336 die staatshervorming kan er nooit komen v r verkiezingen 2009 pas dan zullen franstaligen onderling hun strijd op leven amp dood hebben uitgevochten en zal cd amp v klaar zijn om het kartel te dumpen amp opnieuw een betrouwbare gesprekspartner te worden
5084337 de echte crisis verbergt zich intussen achter het rookgordijn van dramatische momenten deze regering gaat ten onder in drijfzand niet in een tsunami omdat niemand de waarheid luidop wil zeggen
5084338 ook een schijncrisis heeft re le gevolgen coalitiepartners die het ontslag met een stevige korrel zout nemen radicalisering vd publieke opinie bij herhaling ondermijning vd eigen geloofwaardigheid antipolitieke conclusies bij de toeschouwers
5084339 cd amp v maakt uitgebreid gebruik vd crisis als perceptietruc de crisis als uitgelezen kans om duidelijk te maken dat cd amp v nog altijd even radicaal is als n va en dat er met franstaligen niet te onderhandelen valt
5084340 de premier heeft mogelijke amp onmogelijke gedaan aldus cd amp v dat klopt niet hij heeft zijn best gedaan zeker maar is op de grenzen gestoten van wat voor hem mogelijk is voorlopig is dat nog altijd niet genoeg om capabele eerste minister te zijn
5084341 hebben we een echte crisis gezien of alleen een middelmatige enscenering het fenomeen is een stijlfiguur geworden dreigen amp ontslag indienen paleis drukt pauzeknop in bij play staan hoofdrolspelers weer netjes op dezelfde plaats
5084342 het politiek gewicht vd 3 musketiers is onbetekenend hun waterkansje op succes is bovendien meteen onderuit gehaald door nieuwe deadline van n va 01 08 08 zo sukkelen we van deadline naar deadline van diepe crisis naar nog diepere crisis
5084343 politieke leiders waren ooit mensen die het publiek de weg wezen vandaag kijken ze naar de richting die het publiek volgens hen neemt en gaan ze er vervolgens voor lopen het wordt stilaan een pathetisch schouwspel
5084344 het zou om te lachen zijn ware het niet zo dramatisch het zou om te huilen zijn ware het niet zo hilarisch wanneer al het andere niet meer lukt trek dan nog eens een blik oud strijders open

5084346 a growing subset of our senior population are becoming victims of financial fraud
5084347 they have acquired assets property cash and jewelry they are at a stage in life when they may be experiencing the onset of dementia they may be vulnerable because they must rely on others for their physical care
5084348 they dont want you to think they cant take care of themselves they want to be treated with dignity

5084352 this is a little girl who has disappeared and been gone for two months we want to help and want to find closure for this case we are looking for anything anything and all that might give any type of information as to the whereabouts or what happened to her
5084353 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5084354 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5084355 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price
5084356 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5084357 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5084358 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5084359 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5084360 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5084361 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5084362 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5084363 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5084364 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5084365 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5084366 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5084367 look at iraq we have nothing to say to russia
5084368 looks like you two have so called first mover advantage since there aint many if any business marketing podcasts out there

5084373 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5084374 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5084375 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on the 29th of march 2008
5084376 it wont last unless its a common product that is owned by this entire collective of the leadership of zimbabwe
5084377 we can confirm that 2 para 2nd battalion were involved in the incident in which four civilians tragically lost their lives
5084378 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5084379 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target

5084470 we expect the process to move consistent with the july 18 2005 understanding and any change in their nsg position is problematic
5084471 we can not agree to further demands and there is no way we can

5084610 it is troubling that there are so many countries that appear not to record the lives of those animals suffering in their laboratories

5084631 this poem is about two kinds of fire the fire of hell which merely agonizes and the fires of heaven which purify during the poem the first sort of fire suffers itself into the second in the way of exchanging the hallucination plath changed the fire of hell into the fire of heaven when the two mixed together death would become rebirth after plaths death people criticized ted hughes it was not fair though ted had something to do with plaths death however the main reason was the suicidal desire of plath plaths first suicide was in 1953 for she failed to enter the writing class of harvard and the second time was her most dark period of her life plath lost her husband to her friend she couldnt lead an ease life her future was very dark plath was conceited and was anxious to outdo others in plaths whole life she pursued perfection especially to be a perfect daughter in her letters home she was a perfect daughter her life was comfortable her husband was perfect her children were great her writing was better day by day and so on all of these related to her mother aurelia plath played an important role in plaths life she put her hope on plath that a woman should be independent on economic and at the same time to be a successful mother and wife to some extent aurelia plath was perfect in plaths mind however from the bell jar we can see another plath esther esther didnt want to be the kind of woman that her mother hoped in plaths life she had to make difficult decision in the bell jar esthers or plaths fig tree dilemma was it was not just one which faced anyone trying to decide among different careers it was specifically the problem of a woman not granted the luxury of a double life one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantine and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and off beat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out esther or plath was eager to be oneself but being oneself was not only easier for a man in esthers society it also forced women to be what men wanted to be there was a scene that esther returned to her hotel and let her clothes the dirty ones stuffed under her bed by doreen drifted out of the hotel window into the now york city night the action symbolized esthers rejection of identity implied by all those uncomfortable expensive clothes that she mentioned early on in the course of the novel clothes which defined her in a particular way for man and for herself but facing these many choices many statuses she was confused i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree staring to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet
5084632 claive bernnan 2000 9 all of these appeared in plaths 1963 novel
5084633 a note written for the bbc this was the later life of plath in as wife mother and writer plath should care about many things her writing and family she wanted to be an excellent writer a perfect wife and mother all these formed plaths divide selves the public self was tender a good talker but the inner self was up set violent despair wanted to destroy the whole world she owned as we know the confessional poets were talents of imagination and fantasy they were wondering on the edge of madness and insanity they were suffered by the psychosis more or less all of these were based on the extreme pain the poets bear however poetry could release perception imagination and the rational faculty if poets could express his illusion they might keep the interior balance again poetry was the most pure expression of language some critics held that the poetic words could rectify the invisible world that distorted by the self reflection and self destruction to some degree confessional poetry was used for treatment and searching spiritual supports plath felt that if she didnt write nobody would accept her to her writing was substitute if you disliked her you could love her works or could love her through her works 1962 was one piece of the most famous poems of plath once plath wrote the poem is spoken by a girl with an electra complex her father died while she thought he was god
5084634 her case is complicated by the fact that her father was also a nazi and her mother very possibly part jewish
5084635 in the daughter the two strains marry and paralyses each other she has to act out the awful little allegory once over before she is free of it
5084636 actually she questioned that what the meaning of self was plath used the poetic words to express the difficulty of getting perfection this poem was published in 1960s at that time plath lived with ted happily but her poem recorded her intention and sensitivity my hours are married to shadows

5084653 but filter sand cannot be considered sand at all the grain size and silica content is too small to meet construction specifications we do not give leases for this form of sand extraction it violates the mines and minerals regulation and development act
5084654 but it is like killing the goose that lays the golden egg
5084655 i have been asked many times to lease my land for sand extraction but i know in five years their will be nothing left of the land neither sand for extraction nor topsoil for cultivation
5084656 sand extraction is devastating livelihoods here i have seen how farmers who leased out their land a couple of years ago have become workers in their village or in bangalore

5084660 it is men more often than women who are accused of being commitment phobic and dragging their feet about marriage our investigation of male attitudes indicates that there is evidence to support this view
5084661 they are in that stage of life where they are building their income their economic independence the worst thing would be if they were to lose it all
5084662 they know they will have to be there equally with a wife and provide hands on child care
5084663 we have not done a good job of selling marriage to men they dont know all the good things that will change their lives
5084664 married men are healthier than single men wealthier they live longer and happier lives they have more sex
5084665 they have somebody who knows them and tolerates them anyway
5084666 one of the things women have done is invest more in their own careers they have put off forming close relationships and getting married
5084667 it is harder for women to fall in love and to stay in love
5084668 to look good provide great sex join in his recreational activities and tell him he is wonderful
5084669 they want affection they want to feel loved they want a great conversationalist a man who is funny a good father for their kids someone who is attractive a good sexual partner a man who is ambitious and successful and most men are simply not

5084752 if nobody expects us in nato why should we be happy about the expansion of nato and its movement toward our borders
5084753 russia is considering arming its baltic fleet with nuclear warheads for the first time since the cold war
5084754 according to the report under the russian plans nuclear warheads could be supplied to submarines cruisers and fighter bombers of the baltic fleet based in kaliningrad a russian enclave between poland and lithuania
5084755 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
5084756 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
5084757 the sense of alarm may be greatest here in ukraine
5084758 since the orange revolution began in 2004 bringing the pro western viktor yushchenko to power after widespread protests ukraine has been a thorn in moscows side though perhaps not as sharp as the outspoken georgian president mikheil saakashvili
5084759 seen from moscow eyes the attempt of nato to take ukraine or kievan rus the historic heart of slavic russia for almost one thousand years along with russia and belarus was not only militarily a grave threat it was also culturally and economically potentially catastrophic given the distribution of industry and infrastructure between ukraine and russia dating back to the 1930s
5084760 however the proverbial straw that broke the russian camels back was the decision by washington to pursue nuclear missile defense installations in nato members poland and the czech republic
5084761 russia must adequately react to the agreement signed between washington and warsaw on us missile defense shield in polands territory
5084762 trigger for such a war is not georgia s right to annex south ossetia and abkhazia rather it is us insistence on pushing nato and its missile defense right up to russia s door
5084763 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
5084764 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
5084765 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines
5084766 companies such as google and internet service providers are building up huge databases of data about internet users
5084767 these companies may be compelled through a legal action to hand over this information to third parties or the government or the companies may lose the data and it can then be misused
5084768 one third of new owners owe more than house is worth
5084769 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
5084770 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
5084771 more sellers accepting a loss is actually a sign of optimism it means that the transactions might start happening there are so many sales contingent upon the buyer selling their home

5084775 rove has the uncanny ability to see the entire playing field while others are trying to get off the line of scrimmage in addition to vision he is a brilliant tactician he did indeed revolutionize what was politically possible
5084776 i for one would have preferred to see gore include this important caveat in his book and film both for the purpose of completeness and so as to prevent possible misimpressions

5084779 it seems the whole point to this modesty thing is to try and hide the fact that im female if i do that how will a guy ever notice me
5084780 seeing a girl stretching e g arching the back reaching the arms back and sticking out the chest is a stumbling block
5084781 seeing a girls chest bounce when she is walking or running is a stumbling block
5084782 any shorts that are shorter than mid thigh are immodest
5084783 you know maybe those muslims have got a good idea here
5084784 what do you think about obama not pledging allegiance to the flag
5084785 i dont understand your position here if just being there is enough whats to doubt the article certainly established with solid evidence that he spoke to the group
5084786 what do you think about obama not pledging allegiance to the flag
5084787 actually i never claimed that huckabee was a racist i said only that he addressed a racist group and was received well and that much is true and well documented in the article i cited the newsletter of the group he addressed was quoted directly i suppose it could be a flat out lie but that would be pretty unlikely
5084788 this is a limited cdr 100 copies i picked up last week at the thoughtforms gig ever since taking in that spooky ssok vibe in a live context ive been eager to hear more and this collection of tracks is just what my head has been craving the opener feeding tree is a blur burrowing into the minds eye exotic colours strung along a cobweb of frail heart beats everything is delayed escher like into a giddy sickness spiral sucking at the void secondary patterns break across the surface in shivers of excitement as scatter cushions of tune clasp tightly around the phantoms insects ups the tempo a hammered anvil and tip toed accompaniment interspersed with the skid of tyres a pleasing xylophonic vibe filled with clockwork motion that sit well with the introspective nature of the vocals hints of bjork are in there but here the voice is definitely richer than the icelandic pixies bathed in a warm derangement musing on the subject of screaming eyes and insects chatting about the stock exchange she is in my mind is almost too beautiful to describe as poly vocals drift across a twilight of instrumentation punctuated by the fluttering of digital moths those bell like chimes falling in its wake like infected apparitions dispersing on the back of a hypnotic double take that literally weaves between the ears in disappearing key motifs snake of the forties is an altogether more edgy jazz infusion where a sparse reed lullaby opens up to a squalling clarinet bird call that dissolves into another curious vocal bath from here on in the perspective is thrown into a foreshortened free fall becoming a nest of twisted voice shapes spinning and slipping over into the eps closer time is my eye where the sound carnivorously eats up the space around it like a wizard of oz cyclone
5084789 it makes sense why they would want to be called it it makes no sense why we would want to call them that
5084790 this feeds into their idea that this is a religious war and its not
5084791 they want it to be a war of religions but we have said very clearly that this is not a war on islam its not christianity vs islam in some way its about radicals its about extremists who are using violence
5084792 the fact is the muslim world isnt waiting around holding its breath to hear the u s government an infidel entity define islamic terms for them
5084793 this seems to me unprecedented when we fought the japanese and we fought the nazis we called them what they called themselves
5084794 if osama bin laden calls himself a mujahid we should understand what a mujahid is and we should understand that that is in english a holy warrior whos fighting on behalf of islam
5084795 you want to know your enemy how they think what they call themselves what those terms mean
5084796 according to islamic law offensive jihad offensive not just to defend yourself but offensive to go out and invade is as codified and is obilgatory
5084797 the worlds muslims arent holding their breath to hear what sort of islamic legitimacy the us government is about to confer on al qaeda since it is not for non muslims to decide what is and is not islamic in the first place
5084798 you trace it to islamic doctrine and law jihad is simply warfare to subjugate the infidel world to islamic rule

5084807 there is no question from now on when people think of the greatest swimmer of all time its only going to be michael phelps name that comes to their lips
5084808 he won eight gold medals he deserves to be remembered as the hero of the beijing olympics
5084809 that will be when you win everything and overwhelm the position that will be a phelpsian achievement
5084810 this is all a dream come true you know to really just imagination anything and works towards it
5084811 to accomplish everything youve really ever dreamed of its fun
5084812 its phenomenal and i think in my opinion well never ever see it again i just dont think that can be emulated or beaten

5084956 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5084957 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5084958 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas

5084968 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

5084974 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5084975 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5084976 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5084977 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5084978 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5084979 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5084980 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5084981 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5084982 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5084983 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5084984 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5084985 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5084986 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5084987 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5084988 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5084989 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5084990 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5084991 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5084992 estamos con rusia y estamos con el respeto a la soberan a de las naciones
5084993 pasos dados en favor del restablecimiento de la paz en osetia del sur

5085065 we think that teachers shouldnt wear any religious symbols same thing for a judge in court or a minister in the national assembly or a policeman certainly not

5085068 helemaal top natuurlijk ben ik blij met deze overwinning en het kampioenschap voor het team en mezelf maar eerlijk gezegd had ik niet anders verwacht hier samen met jeroen we weten dat we een sterk team hebben en de auto gaat het hele jaar al geweldig het ging waanzinnig goed vandaag het waren af en toe listige omstandigheden met het verkeer maar toen we eenmaal twee ronden voor lagen dan is het nog een kwestie van uitrijden dan pak je de volgende auto maar na de bocht in plaats van ervoor in het begin van de race neem je wat meer risico om een gat te cre ren dat was tegen het einde niet meer nodig
5085069 we wilden dolgraag het kampioenschap binnen halen en dat is gelukt drie keer gewonnen n keer tweede en winst op le mans wat kun je nog meer wensen de le mans series is waar mijn toekomst ligt dit vind ik echt leuk racen zeker in een goede auto zoals de porsche

5085093 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5085094 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5085096 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5085097 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5085098 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5085099 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5085100 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5085101 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5085102 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5085103 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5085104 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5085105 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5085106 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5085108 revitalize the study and teaching of history by reorienting the historical profession toward an accessible integrated history free from fragmentation and over specialization the society promotes frank debate in an atmosphere of civility mutual respect and common courtesy all we require is that participants lay down plausible premises reason logically appeal to evidence and prepare for exchanges with those who hold different points of view the historical society conducts activities that are intellectually profitable providing a forum where economic political intellectual social and other historians can exchange ideas and contribute to each others work our goal is also to promote a scholarly history that is accessible to the public
5085109 the perils and pleasures of going popular or my life as a loser
5085110 i faced a mountain sized learning curve as an academic i had mastered a particular set of rules but in my new career none of that applied the public doesnt care about the literature the public doesnt care whats au courant in the ivy tower and which trends have gone the way of the dodo the public is interested in only two things that the history they read contain a lively narrative a story and that the person telling the story be honest snip so up the mountain i trekked learning to write a new kind of history i hunted for the story buried amid the facts i struggled to craft sentences that gasp contained active verbs and narratives based on real human beings many of them bigger gasp dead white males but i refused to abandon my primary mission to bring well researched well documented well reasoned history to non academic readers to that end i plowed through reams of primary documents spent months sitting in front of microfilm readers shelled out money traveling to archives and libraries i wanted my books to land on the front table at barnes amp noble but i wanted them to contain the same scholarly research as a monograph read by six not that i expected anyone to notice seven or so years into this new venture i know that the average reader doesnt grasp the difference between a primary document and a secondary source and is unaware of the difference between a local public library and the one found at a university or for that matter between a library and google

5085152 that most of the fathers were highly involved at the onset of birth of their children and that involvement was enhanced by mens positive attitude toward fathering commitment to a couple relationship and stable full time wages roy 2004
5085153 twelve months after the birth of children multiple disruptions including relationship conflict and financial instability contributed to fathers departures from households

5085202 the liars are finding themselves wingless in these abundant winds
5085203 the next tether is close at hand its not about being different its about being alone forever a configuration makes sense but geometries shift
5085204 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said id live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
5085205 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5085206 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5085207 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5085208 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5085209 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5085210 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5085211 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5085212 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5085213 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
5085214 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play
5085215 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5085216 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5085217 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5085218 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5085219 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5085220 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5085221 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5085222 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5085223 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5085224 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5085225 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5085226 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5085227 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5085228 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5085229 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5085230 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5085231 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5085232 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5085233 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5085234 there was a lot of football to evaluate sunday i was pleased with a good portion of it and some of it was pretty ugly
5085235 you just know somebody is going to end up going to kirkland out of habit i cant wait to see who it is
5085236 i could not make it out but i could feel him lecturing me communicating some urgency then after some time he turned his body and pointed out towards the landscape gesturing for me to look at something important
5085237 i dont know anything bout the zte broadband scam but one thing is clear to me we need to do something now not now nor tomorrow but now something that will spark the majors its all really in our hands not for the sake of repeating history but for the sake of doing something right sometime

5085245 dan has guided through me through various theological issues and questions but what is more important to me is that he has helped me ground those issues in the daily reality of my relationship with god and his people dan has walked with me through some of the most profound times of spiritual questioning and growth in my life in the past year
5085246 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
5085247 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
5085248 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
5085249 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
5085250 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
5085251 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
5085252 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
5085253 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
5085254 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
5085255 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

5085271 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5085272 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end

5085290 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5085291 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5085316 any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and any city or house divided against itself shall not stand
5085317 and if satan casts out satan he is divided against himself how then shall his kingdom stand
5085318 and if i by beelzebub cast out demons by whom do your sons cast them out consequently they shall be your judges
5085319 but if i cast out demons by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god has come upon you

5085742 right now the m4 carbine is a world class weapon
5085743 my personal opinion is that we have to step up to a new carbine with a more lethal round
5085744 i dont think we need an unhealthy discordant debate over the current carbine because i dont think the current carbine is a long lived solution anyway however the m4 carbine has been continuously improved it has 68 substantial engineering design changes and about 380 total engineering design changes so its become a modular system its very accurate its the most accurate of the carbines its the lightest of the carbines and its the shortest of the carbines were very pleased with it and we expect it to be the armys carbine of record for a little while
5085745 a full and open competition of at least the technical data package
5085746 but maybe improvements beyond that but i think that will be an interim step toward a new more powerful carbine at a time to be determined

5086013 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defence shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
5086014 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5086015 it is extremely important to break the circle of inconclusive investigations in regard of the recent murders of journalists in russia
5086016 the violent death of any member of the media stifles the free spirit of journalism but in this case the expediency of action is extremely important also because anna politkovskaya was an outspoken critic of government policies
5086017 we never got the article but she had evidence about these abducted people and there were photographs

5086028 in the supermarket consumers use camera equipped cell phones to scan the qr code on the label the code links to a mobile website detailing origin soil composition organic fertilizer content percentage as opposed to chemical use of pesticides and herbicides and even the name of the farm it was grown on consumers can also access the same information over the ibaraki agricultural produce net website by inputting a numbered code on each label
5086029 after learning about daily food requirements and nutritional balance through lectures and quizzes parents and children formed pairs to participate in a rally style quiz on vegetables using mobile phones
5086030 for the most part we have a uav on station for the majority of missions that involve the capture of high value targets or terrorists
5086031 the aircraft is an active contributor to the actual apprehension of these criminal its hard to imagine combat today without uavs the aircrafts capabilities are continuously improving and they are beginning to do a lot of the same missions as our manned aircraft
5086032 our guys fly them out hand them off to the brigade combat teams in theater and at that time the specific brigade tactical uav elements actually fly the missions
5086033 the brigades route the aircraft back into our air space and the uav operators here pick the aircraft back up and land them once they land we conduct maintenance and prep them for another mission
5086034 everything we do in terms of maintaining the aircraft is annotated by inputting information into our computer system we keep track of just about anything you can think of from actual flight hours to required services and inspections
5086035 the uavs can provide at least 70 percent of the support you would get from an attack helicopter minus the armament
5086036 the operators can observe perform route reconnaissance and report immediately over voice what they see to the ground forces very similar to conventional aerial reconnaissance methods its very helpful
5086037 the shadow provides coverage for a lot of raids we do road scans for roadside bombs and have actually caught terrorists in the act of implanting these bombs in the road the uav mission is imperative to todays combat operations
5086038 when the infantry troops are going into a certain area to clear buildings well go in ahead of time and scan the area and well be able to report to them exact grids of potential enemies in the area

5086062 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was

5086076 i think in football theres too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere

5086126 weve had two days of very heavy rains from thunderstorms that dropped significant moisture over that area thats what caused the dam to become overtopped and breached
5086127 more rain is expected later on this afternoon we expect development of showers over northwest moving southeast over the area
5086128 disappointed is not in my vocabulary when im doing this

5086130 your lives are fading in the shadows of time but your legacy lives on
5086131 i am still getting the same rhetoric that i was getting two years ago
5086132 it doesnt take sherlock holmes to figure it out this whole thing stinks
5086133 a few have now been put off buying in cyprus when they heard what happened to me
5086134 im not going to stay quiet any more and watch other people lose their savings im sleeping in a tent thats what i got for my 75 000 ive lost my home but im not moving from here until i let everyone know what a corrupt society cyprus is
5086135 sure i am your date for the mardi gras party tomorrow night i have been sent by your fairy dyke mother and i dont turn into a pumpkin at midnight
5086136 the national telecommunications and information administration an agency of the department of commerce is the show stopper here
5086137 theyre the only department of the government that isnt on board with securing the domain name system and unfortunately theyre also the ones who commerce deputized to oversee icann
5086138 the biggest difference is that once the root is signed and the public key is out it will be put in every operating system and will be on all cds from apple microsoft suse freebsd etc
5086139 the only one you have to have to go down the tree
5086140 a few years ago there were still technical hurdles to actually signing and using dnssec but in the past few years a lot of software tools both commercial and open source have come out and now its a completely solved problem
5086141 all thats left is the far less tractable purely political problem
5086142 arguing over who gets to hold the cryptographic keys in the long run should wait until were not facing a critical threat
5086143 we are committed to taking no action that would have the potential to adversely affect the operational stability of the dns
5086144 while there is increasing pressure to secure the dns ntia must work with all stakeholders and consider all possible solutions
5086145 currently dnssec is the only mechanism known to protect against the kaminsky attack
5086146 it is not clear that other solutions will provide the same level of protection as dnssec
5086147 then the issue becomes political because there seems to be the perception that the introduction of a key guardian changes the current policies
5086148 we would want to bring the editing creation and signing of the root zone file here
5086149 if the root isnt signed then no amount of work that responsible individuals and companies do to protect their domains will be effective
5086150 you have to follow the chain of signatures down from the root to the top level domain to the users domain if all three pieces arent there the user isnt protected
5086151 they tell me you are sending me to earth tomorrow but how am i going to live there being so small and helpless
5086152 among the many angels i chose one for you she will be waiting for you and will take care of you
5086153 but tell me here in heaven i dont do anything else but sing and smile thats enough for me to be happy
5086154 your angel will tell you the most beautiful and sweet words you will ever hear and with much patience and care your angel will teach you how to speak
5086155 your angel will place your hands together and will teach you how to pray
5086156 your angel will always talk to you about me and will teach you the way for you to come back to me even though i will always be next to you
5086157 oh god if i am about to leave now please tell me my angels name
5086158 your angels name is not hard to remember you will simply call her mommy
5086159 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
5086160 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
5086161 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5086162 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5086163 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5086164 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5086165 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5086166 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5086167 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5086168 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5086169 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5086170 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5086171 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5086172 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5086173 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5086174 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5086175 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5086176 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5086177 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5086178 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5086179 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5086180 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5086181 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
5086182 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
5086183 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
5086184 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
5086185 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
5086186 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
5086187 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5086188 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5086189 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5086190 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5086191 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5086192 im really delighted to be able to play for hamburg now

5086197 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
5086198 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
5086199 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
5086200 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
5086201 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson

5086207 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5086208 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5086209 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5086210 you won the first round and are now moving on to round 2
5086211 what do i do if an agent wants to sign me
5086212 students are not going to gain anything outta this as you are finishing the syllabus in the last moment

5086214 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
5086215 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
5086216 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
5086217 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
5086218 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
5086219 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
5086220 shes marketable do you think they wont hesitate to take her so they can make money
5086221 she needs her hair brushed be a mom and take care of it
5086222 make up your fucking mind you god damned hypocrite you scream and holler about when she cries and you scream and holler when i do nothing just so you can have some damned peace and quiet

5086228 but trying to pump out that many cars that quick theres no way he can put in the time with each car that he did when it was there next to chevys
5086229 the quote ive heard the most that describes aaron dead on is a natural born used car salesman

5086234 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5086235 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5086236 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5086237 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present
5086238 september 20 is looking like its going to work out
5086239 the colbert report and the daily show are notable for having relatively well informed audiences that are younger than the national average
5086240 whether it was voting against or voting present on issues related to stricter penalties on offenders of serious crimes or disallowing citizens to exercise their right to self defense obama demonstrated poor judgment on an important issue to his constituents
5086241 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5086242 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5086243 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5086244 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead he said
5086245 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5086246 some buttered toast crisp bacon two poached eggs and a hooker of hollandaise

5086248 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5086249 i would make an alliance with the devil himself if it would help me defeat herr hitler
5086250 the supreme court has recently reaffirmed that you are free to discuss the petitions of candidates on issues and how officials have voted in office without being subject to campaign finance restrictions
5086251 we have been so inspired by the record the usa has in this event after japan 2005 where we finished outside of the medals by an inch we knew we could achieve great things i looked over and saw we had crossed the finish line and i was done i just put my blade on the water and my hands in the air
5086252 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5086253 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5086254 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5086255 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5086256 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5086257 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5086258 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5086259 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5086260 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5086261 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5086262 what i would most like to change in the world is
5086263 what i most want to accomplish with my life is
5086264 the only normal people are the ones you dont know very well
5086265 i didnt even want to buy these coliseum tickets online it as your idea
5086266 it was my idea i found the website we can even look at old msn conversations and emails
5086267 excuse me what did you say to me earlier on in the day
5086268 well the heat got to me it was my idea
5086269 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
5086270 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
5086271 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
5086272 in the last week we saw a lot of volatility due to global crude prices we also saw weakness due to the long weekend and profit booking as the market was not keen to take positions home in the coming week crude and inflation will play a crucial role the addition of 39 stocks in derivatives segment will generate more liquidity in the market
5086273 id carefully prepared for a difficult duel with stoner which the first laps of the race confirmed
5086274 but i have to say as well that my motorcycle was running perfectly and allowed me to ride very calmly towards victory
5086275 we visited the grand canyon in arizona and took a trip down to the bottom of the canyon by horse we hadnt gone too far when my wifes horse stumbled and she almost fell off
5086276 whats wrong with you woman why did you shoot the poor animal like that are you crazy
5086277 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5086278 now i implore you brothers watch out for those who cause dissensions and pitfalls contrary to the doctrine you have learned avoid them for such people do not serve our lord christ but their own appetites and by smooth talk and flattering words they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting
5086279 beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravaging wolves
5086280 proclaim the message persist in it whether convenient or not rebuke correct and encourage with great patience and teaching for the time will come when they will not tolerate sound doctrine but according to their own desires will accumulate teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear something new they will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths
5086281 god must have needed another tenor in the heavenly choir
5086282 tell us your favorite memory tell us you miss them then be quiet
5086283 the lord never gives you more than you can handle
5086284 the lord struck down the child of david and bathsheba and he become ill
5086285 it is not suffering that destroys people but suffering without meaning
5086286 i will not allow this loss to rob me of the joys of living
5086287 it did not really matter what we expected from life but rather what life expected from us we needed to stop asking about the meaning of life and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life daily and hourly our answer must consist not in talk and meditation but in right action and in right conduct life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual
5086288 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5086289 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5086290 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5086291 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5086292 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5086293 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5086294 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5086295 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5086296 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5086297 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5086298 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5086299 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5086300 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5086301 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5086302 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5086303 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5086304 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5086305 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5086306 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5086307 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5086308 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5086309 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5086310 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5086311 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5086312 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5086313 this is a planning took where all things are going
5086314 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5086315 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5086316 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5086317 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5086318 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5086319 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5086320 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5086321 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5086322 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5086323 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5086324 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5086325 sorry wim yes i am italian can you tell me when you will join us thank you for being so not italian
5086326 a lot of evils been perpetuated based on the claim that we were fighting evil
5086327 i dont need a stupid boyfriend to write a corny love song
5086328 you take a bunch of eggs six or so warm them to room temperature and take out an iron skillet warm it up the skillet with olive oil in it enough to coat the bottom take some potatoes 4 to 5 medium yukons preferably the kind that wont fall apart like the more waxy kind and cube them small cubes 1 to 2 inches then you want to fry them the potato cubes in the oil not so theyre french fry crispy but just till theyre softened while those are frying chop up some onions one medium yellow or white onion then throw these into the frying potatoes once theyre as soft as you want them the potatoes and onions take them out of the skillet and put them on a plate w a paper towel so the oil will soak off wipe the skillet add more oil then crack your eggs into a bowl and beat them put the potato mixture into the eggs plus some salt amp pepper and mix it up then pour your egg etc mixture into the skillet cook this like youre cooking an omelet cooking one side run your spatula around the edges as it starts to firm up once the edges look like theyre starting to brown but the center is still slightly wet take a plate big enough to cover the skillet put this face down on top of the skillet flip the skillet over so the tortilla goes onto the plate then put the skillet back down if this turned out kind of messy you might want to wipe out the skillet and add more oil slide your tortilla back into the skillet this time to cook the other side once side 2 is done cooking take it out and put it on a clean plate cut into wedges add more salt amp pepper if you want and serve it with lots of mayonaise smeared on top and a stout cup of coffee
5086329 those two offices township treasurer and county deputy treasurer would not be compatible
5086330 she will have to resign from one to be in the other
5086331 im fully confident bonnie will do a good job for the township
5086332 we focus on community service for campus city or national events
5086333 we also help out with general things around city like serve dinner for the salvation army whenever they need extra volunteers
5086334 the temple city voice has helped train me to know what and how to write
5086335 its taught me to appreciate things and being in a newspaper you see things that a lot of people dont know about
5086336 im glad that i have some time to relax even if its just lounging around its a nice difference from always being at events always being around
5086337 but im a little sad at not being privy to that world not seeing how that part of the world works anymore
5086338 doing things early and on time takes a lot of pressure off your back i still have trouble on that but i think its gotten better partially because of the voice and college
5086339 people do rely on you and if people rely on you you cant let them down
5086340 woe to the world for temptations to sin for it is necessary that temptations come but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes esv
5086341 die spd hat ihn nie verabschiedet er ist nach wie vor einer der gro en in der spd
5086342 gerade f r den wahlkampf ist franz m ntefering mit seinem vertrauenskapital ganz wichtig f r die partei
5086343 nat rlich w nschen wir uns dass er weiter aktiv politik macht
5086344 nun kommt es darauf an den schaden in grenzen zu halten
5086345 wenn die partei ihn inst ndig ruft und bettelt wird er darauf reagieren
5086346 m ntefering kann neben dem parteivorsitzenden und dem kanzlerkandidaten wichtige integrierende aufgaben bernehmen wenn er denn will
5086347 gerade f r den wahlkampf ist franz m ntefering mit seinem vertrauenskapital ganz wichtig f r die partei er wird in allen fl geln gesch tzt
5086348 da ist es fast schon logisch dass der sechste dieses amt bereits einmal innehatte so m ssten wir uns nicht schon wieder an einen neuen namen gew hnen
5086349 wer nicht arbeitet soll auch nicht essen die w hler sollen uns nicht an den aussagen vor der wahl messen
5086350 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5086351 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5086352 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5086353 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5086354 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5086355 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5086356 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5086357 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5086358 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5086359 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5086360 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5086361 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5086362 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5086363 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5086364 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5086365 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5086366 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5086367 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5086368 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5086369 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5086370 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5086371 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5086372 if a child hasnt been given spiritual values within the family setting they have no familiarity with the values that are necessary for the just and peaceful functioning in society
5086373 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5086374 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5086375 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5086376 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5086377 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5086378 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5086379 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5086380 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5086381 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5086382 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5086383 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5086384 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5086385 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5086386 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5086387 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5086388 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5086389 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5086390 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5086391 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5086392 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5086393 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5086394 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5086395 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5086396 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5086397 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5086398 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5086399 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5086400 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5086401 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5086402 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5086403 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5086404 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5086405 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5086406 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5086407 government never gets around to doing anything the important things
5086408 im expecting eventually the government just being mature and mediocre would be satisfying
5086409 good job you can keep your clubs keep playing single bogey is really good
5086410 why cant black people simply accept that not all people like black people and many kkk members and neo nazis have a different outlook for mankind
5086411 you can tell were the intellectuals because were the ones taking pictures of the coin operated binoculars
5086412 i dont think wales won any golds in athens so its brilliant to represent my home nation here and make it a second welsh gold after nicoles brilliant ride
5086413 im so proud of what the welsh rugby team have done nicole did fantastically in the cycling and weve still got tom lucy to come in the rowing tomorrow and geraint thomas in the velodrome

5086421 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5086422 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5086423 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5086424 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5086425 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5086426 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5086427 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget

5086436 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5086437 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5086438 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5086439 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5086440 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5086441 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5086442 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5086443 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5086444 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5086445 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5086446 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5086447 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5086448 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5086449 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5086450 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5086451 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

5086466 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5086467 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would

5086488 until people reach a level of understanding through reading and educating themselves they will not evolve as spiritual beings and will live with fear anger etc

5086493 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5086494 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5086495 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5086496 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5086497 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5086498 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5086499 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5086500 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5086501 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5086502 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5086503 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5086504 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5086505 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5086506 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5086507 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5086508 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5086517 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5086518 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5086519 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
5086520 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
5086521 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
5086522 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it

5086537 ive been in politics for 20 years and for 20 years ive had
5086538 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5086539 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5086540 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5086541 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5086542 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5086543 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5086544 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5086545 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5086555 we trust that there will be a conclusion very soon there are issues that are outstanding but quite clearly one has no business in negotiating if you are not prepared to compromise
5086556 it is critical that we conclude this dialogue as a matter of urgency
5086557 we want the palestinians to understand that we want to live with them in peace we are ready for historic reconciliation
5086558 and this sort of release we are hopeful will help create a more positive environment between israelis and palestinians and support the process of negotiation which is ongoing
5086559 for the palestinian people the issue of prisoners is a very difficult issue a sensitive issue and we have answered positively to this request by the palestinian leadership
5086560 can in fact deliver much more for their own people than the extremists than the terrorists ever can
5086561 in saying that as a person of faith obama believes that things will work out and that we will get the president we need he may be picking up on the sovereignty of god whose ways are perfect but one hopes he understands that god in his sovereignty can visit catastrophe on a wayward people if we are spiritually unwise in our choice of leaders we may well get a spanking we need
5086562 mccain answers questions by telling stories obama answers like an academic i think people like storytellers better than professors they will like mccains simple yes and no responses obama tries to show he would be a good leader by recognizing nuance and complexity mccain tries to show he would be a good leader by being decisive
5086563 to grant that abortion is a moral issue but to duck when human life begins is at best inconsistent one would think it is vital no pun intended to think though exactly that question obamas unguarded line about not punishing a daughter of his with a child really hurt him in the pro life movement
5086564 obama has correctly refocused the abortion question on how women experience pregnancy and abortion for far too long the discussion has focused solely on fetuses as if they exist somehow independent of the women in whose bodies they reside
5086565 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5086566 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5086567 obama will be hammered by the religious right for that pay grade answer
5086568 specious obama has made that very determination in opening the law wide to the killing of the unborn
5086569 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5086570 absolute certainty that the woman herself does have moral status then the conservative thing to do is to protect the womans interests first
5086571 still does not answer the question of what to do when there is a conflict with the rights of the woman
5086572 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf and even the so called rhythm method
5086573 which has the effect of timing intercourse not only to prevent conception but also to allow conception at a time when the fertilized egg will drop into a uterus that is not at the right time of month for implantation
5086574 evaded the question of whether he will or will not continue to support embryonic stem cell research as long as the scientists say it is necessary
5086575 odd not to ask it after all if you are going to talk to someone about religion youd be interested to know their thoughts about the central figure in their religion
5086576 is why there were not representatives from other faith communities who are also voting this is a multi religious nation
5086577 personal testimony and scripture citation are both treasured by evangelicals
5086578 mccains knowledge and strong stance for what is just and right he also expressed a sense of humor that i have not seen before

5086592 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5086593 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5086594 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5086595 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response
5086596 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5086597 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision

5086639 in addition to supporting multiple active controllers clustered systems virtualize the individual controllers and make the entire set of controllers appear as one single storage system to hosts
5086640 i believe the architecture has these features but ibm didnt feel comfortable presenting them to the market yet

5086651 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
5086652 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
5086653 it was far less about religion and a lot more about values
5086654 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5086655 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5086656 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5086657 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5086658 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5086659 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5086660 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5086661 hes a man of few words but when he tells stories he connects
5086662 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5086663 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5086664 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5086665 those are the judges that the evangelicals that social conservative voters want to hear from john mccains own lips that he opposes and that he would not support because the issue of judges is perhaps one of the most if not the most important issue for many social conservatives
5086666 the voters out there who went out in large numbers for george w bush that is one of the things that they want to hear from john mccain because that is something that gives them a lot more faith in john mccain
5086667 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5086668 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5086669 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5086670 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5086671 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision

5086678 trespassers will be turned over to the police immediately as soon as we see them
5086679 if they run we will trace them to the end with cameras
5086680 we ve tried to do what we can to keep them out of the range including strengthening patrols reminding them that this place is off limits and setting up warning signs
5086681 a growing number of people are consistently coming up causing great risks to the forces and themselves
5086682 i am tremendously fortunate to be able to come to work every day and do a job that i love
5086683 it s like the academy awards the stars are the warfighters the fleet but i have a supporting role to these people if i can come in as the base for all these stove pipe efforts that are going on strategically what i could say is you re doing the same thing as this one over here we could do it like this and knock off this many i wouldn t say people because it s not always about people it has to do with capabilities
5086684 everything i ve got 55 000 structures worldwide and every one of them is being evaluated on their importance in four areas i call them the four c s configuration of the building the capacity of the building the complexity of the building and most importantly the capability what is it doing to support warfighting when you add all these up with engineering fairy dust you get a figure of merit so what i m allowed to do based on that and the input from the warfighters and the commanding officers i have an integrated priority list from the no 1 to no 55 000 in order of importance and so for the first time you can say got it got it you re out of here the problem is everybody likes to hold on to everything
5086685 in the interim if we don t have the money to demolish because we have to conform to all the environmental stuff and it gets expensive then we can mothball it so we re not putting good money into electricity utilities
5086686 the gw represents a big change in the type of ship that we re bringing in to yokosuka we ve already built a beautiful new building there to handle the generation plant now with the advent of the ship coming in there it s almost like a push in terms of the number of people coming the biggest change is because that carrier has different power requirements those had to be accommodated which led to building certain infrastructure around there as far as sailor quality of life the best mwr that i have seen in terms of robustness in terms of totally focused on the sailor and in terms of complexity for the families is in japan in every base that i ve gone through here they re highly efficient they re highly effective they re some of the best people we have in management in those areas and they are working overtime to take care of the sailors
5086687 zoning just means that in any planned development or community in the united states it s zoned well that s what i want our bases to be meaning you know where the administration area is you know where the logistics area is you know where the operational area is you know where the recreational areas are and people don t get confused so right now i ve got people who should be in administrative areas trying to take land in the waterfront and that s for the operators it s not for the admin people well it s a nice view and i have a couple of stars so what i m trying to do is build consistency when it comes to zoning i can t change these bases they haven t changed since 1945 but what i can do is start putting the people who morphed out of their areas back where they should be

5086711 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5086712 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5086713 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation

5086716 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5086717 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5086718 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst

5086720 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5086721 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5086722 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5086723 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5086724 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
5086725 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
5086726 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
5086727 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent

5086766 sobrang sobrang okey kasi noong kinausap ko yung handler ko si ate gidget dela cuesta kinausap ko siya about it at sabi naman niya kung saan naman daw ako masaya they will be supporting me naman daw kasi i stayed with them after
5086767 we parted ways na maganda and they know me na gusto kong mag grow at gusto kong maging successful at alam nyo naman na masyadong maraming artist na dumarating at marami rin naman ang umaalis siyempre ako na rin mismo ang kailangang gumawa ng paraan para magkaroon ako ng place rito
5086768 at saka gusto ko rin i prove sa mga tao na marami pa naman akong puwedeng ibigay hindi lang po talaga ako nabibigyan ng chance
5086769 of course its gonna be hard but i think kaya naman and with the help of tito rommel and i have many friends naman in gma alam ko na sa pbb talaga ko nakilala pero actually noong college days ko pa pagkagaling ko sa states i really started in gma

5086799 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5086800 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5086801 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5086802 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5086803 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5086804 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5086805 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5086806 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5086807 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5086808 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5086809 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5086810 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5086811 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5086812 fred cant even take a shit unless someone else massages his bowels
5086813 fred and i agree on so many issues it just made sense

5086815 fred is an actor if he has to speak in tongues handle snakes and roll on the floor to get those toothless hillbillies votes hell do it and theyll believe him hell they believed a silver spoon spoiled frat boy like bush was one of their own theyll believe anything

5086819 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5086820 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5086821 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5086822 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5086823 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5086824 they released a purported dna result although it was uncertain if the dna info was supposed to be compared to other primates

5086827 we can confirm that 2 para 2nd battalion were involved in the incident in which four civilians tragically lost their lives
5086828 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5086829 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5086830 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5086831 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5086832 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5086833 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5086834 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5086835 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5086836 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5086837 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5086838 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5086839 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5086840 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5086841 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5086842 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5086843 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks

5086872 what we struggle with 10 years out is letting people know the scope of what all we do
5086873 i think its important to say we dont perform or refer for abortions
5086874 at lot of women dont even know that an abortion is a surgical procedure and what it entails we want them to be aware of the physical risks along with the emotional and spiritual risks
5086875 we run a pretty well oiled machine as far as being good stewards with what weve been blessed with
5086876 the nice thing is we will minister to a women while shes pregnant to the time the baby is a year old
5086877 we not only assist with emotional support but with practical items too
5086878 people think we use graphic photos or try to coerce them but we dont

5086888 there are no factual assertions that religion can reasonably claim as its own
5086889 i am not a muslim i am a christian and this is my choice that said if i were a muslim i would be proud of that
5086890 while i am not a muslim i want to be the one to say that islam is just as decent and valid a way of life as any other and i am disappointed that this has become such a point of contention in this campaign
5086891 uh yes ill have a butter milk biscuit and the all american apple pie
5086892 would you like anything else we have biryani rice hummus and couscous as a nice side dish
5086893 that sounds weird no i think ill just have a coke with that
5086894 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5086895 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5086896 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5086897 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5086898 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5086899 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5086900 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5086901 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5086902 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5086903 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5086904 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5086905 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5086906 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5086907 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5086908 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5086909 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5086910 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5086911 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5086912 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5086913 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5086914 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5086915 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5086916 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5086917 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5086918 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5086919 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5086920 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5086921 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5086922 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5086923 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5086924 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5086925 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5086926 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5086927 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5086928 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5086929 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5086930 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5086931 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5086932 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5086933 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5086934 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5086935 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5086936 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5086937 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5086938 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5086939 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5086940 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5086941 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5086942 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5086943 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5086944 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5086945 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5086946 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5086947 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5086948 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5086949 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
5086950 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5086951 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5086952 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5086953 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5086954 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
5086955 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
5086956 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5086957 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5086958 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5086959 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5086960 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5086961 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5086962 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5086963 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5086964 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5086965 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5086966 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5086967 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5086968 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5086969 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5086970 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5086971 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5086972 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5086973 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5086974 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5086975 the obama campaign for example paid 85 million to gmmb a media consulting firm

5086990 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5086991 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5086992 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5086993 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
5086994 mr deeb hasnt actually violated any law or regulation that i can find but i dont like what hes doing because im ignorant and irrationally afraid of chemicals so ill abuse my power to steal his property and shut him down
5086995 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5086996 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5086997 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
5086998 at the world half marathon championships in canada everybody said i couldnt run but i showed today what i can do
5086999 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements
5087000 suppressing those movements means a lot to people with huntingtons disease
5087001 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
5087002 you wont be seeing me in wal mart as often
5087003 i may also cut down on visits to my mother in the lincoln nursing home shes aware of the cost and understands since she grew up during the depression and rationing during world war ii its going to be really hard on those in nursing homes if their families cant visit as often i buy some basics such as paper goods in bulk already but that means the next time i go in it will be higher due to trucking costs ill just have to compare prices a lot closer
5087004 my vehicle seems to run better on ethanol so i buy it the most my husband checks the tire pressure to make sure they are where they should be i try to get gas when its cooler out like first thing in the morning i also try not to let it get below a quarter full i use the slow speed on the pump handle i have come across some that only have the high speed so i try to avoid those
5087005 every county that i know of has cut down their sealing and overlaying by one third
5087006 then almost all of the counties are doing what im doing im not buying any equipment or anything earlier in the year they are waiting until later in the year so they can see where their budget is at
5087007 you can do it for awhile but eventually something has to give
5087008 your equipment has got to be replaced or whatever and if you dont do it eventually you are going to pay for it last year was the same way we sealed until we ran out of money five miles over by lorraine we didnt get done which we normally would
5087009 he was the fattest prisoner that got off the plane
5087010 he doesnt want to talk about how he turned in all those names
5087011 respectfully im going to disagree with you when it comes to mccain and his service i think his policies are horrible i think his service was honorable
5087012 wow hss already gone commercial i cant wait to post this to the forums
5087013 dead woman being carried by the georgian soldiers from the town of gori
5087014 georgians stand next to the body of their son in the town of gori
5087015 georgian soldiers carry an injured woman in the town of gori 80 km 50 miles from tbilisi august 9 2008
5087016 saturday georgian troops pass an appartment block in the georgian town of gori
5087017 in responding to a georgian attack on russian troops in south ossetia last week the kremlins military humiliated georgian forces in fighting that killed at least 2 000 and displaced around 100 000
5087018 fighting began in the evening on thursday august 7 when georgia launched a surprise operation sending a large force against the breakaway republic and reaching the capital tskhinvali streets came under a hail of fire as georgian forces met strong resistance from separatist units in south ossetia
5087019 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5087020 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5087021 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5087022 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5087023 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5087024 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5087025 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5087026 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5087027 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5087028 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5087029 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5087030 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5087031 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5087032 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5087033 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5087034 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5087035 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5087036 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5087037 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5087038 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5087039 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5087040 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5087041 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5087042 i think he felt he was defending a womans integrity
5087043 this was a cowardly attack on two vulnerable members of the community
5087044 the speed of our response tonight is indicative of the seriousness we police place on policing the farming community and responding to their concerns

5087046 she dreams of someday opening a brick and mortar design store but for now this blog serves as a window into her tastes and aesthetics and what she would offer her public
5087047 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5087048 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5087049 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent

5087055 people try to put us down just because we get around
5087056 the further down the street you went the badder it got
5087057 the humiliation and mental torture of being ostracised and having no work to do proved too much i went into depression and had to be hospitalised
5087058 i feel my struggle was vindicated when the petroleum ministry wrote to the ioc chairman expressing displeasure of government at the way it handled my complaint
5087059 if you are fighting for truth you get strength automatically
5087060 voglio essere spiegato sono veloce come un alce per tagliare gli alberi si usa la cetta
5087061 sai che da cr a bg ci son 23 rotonde
5087062 president kennedy was pilloried by the super patriots as a no win chief the far right became a fount of proposals born of frustration and put forward in the name of anti communism active duty commanders played host to anti communist seminars on their bases and attended or addressed right wing meetings elsewhere
5087063 could think of manufacturing something that would be generally acceptable
5087064 should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the cuban government as rash and irresponsible and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the western hemisphere
5087065 by manufacturing various pieces of evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the cubans
5087066 a series of well coordinated incidents to take place in and around
5087067 start riots near the main gate of the base others would pretend to be saboteurs inside the base ammunition would be blown up fires started aircraft sabotaged mortars fired at the base with damage to installations
5087068 we could blow up a u s ship in guantanamo bay and blame cuba
5087069 casualty lists in u s newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation
5087070 we could develop a communist cuban terror campaign in the miami area in other florida cities and even in washington
5087071 the terror campaign could be pointed at cuban refugees seeking haven in the united states we could sink a boatload of cubans en route to florida real or simulated we could foster attempts on lives of cuban refugees in the united states even to the extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized
5087072 create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the united states to jamaica guatemala panama or venezuela the destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross cuba the passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non scheduled flight
5087073 make it appear that communist cuban migs have destroyed a usaf aircraft over international waters in an unprovoked attack
5087074 that this responsibility for both oven and covert military operations be assigned to the joint chiefs of staff
5087075 the joint chiefs of staff believe that the cuban problem must be solved in the near future
5087076 further they see no prospect of early success in overthrowing the present communist regime either as a result of internal uprising or external political economic or psychological pressures accordingly they believe that military intervention by the united states will be required to overthrow the present communist regime
5087077 the joint chiefs of staff believe that the united states can undertake military intervention in cuba without risk of general war
5087078 they also believe that the intervention can be accomplished rapidly enough to minimize communist opportunities for solicitation of un action
5087079 t he joint chiefs of staff recommend that a national policy of early military intervention in cuba be adopted by the united states they also recommend that such intervention be undertaken as soon as possible and preferably before the release of national guard and reserve forces presently on active duty
5087080 i am the senior military my job to state what i believe and its his mcnamaras job to approve or disapprove
5087081 he gave general lemnitzer very short shrift and treated him like a schoolboy the general almost stood at attention when he came into the room everything was yes sir and no sir
5087082 we need a shake up of the joint chiefs of staff
5087083 we direly need a new chairman as well as new members
5087084 a contrived cuban attack on an oas organization of americas member could be set up
5087085 and the attacked state could be urged to take measures of self defense and request ice from the u s and oas the u s could almost certainly obtain necessary two thirds support among oas members for collective action against cuba
5087086 any of the contrived situations de above are inherently extremely risky in our democratic system in which security can be maintained after the fact with very great difficulty if the decision should be made to set up a contrived situation it be one in which participation by u s personnel is limited only to the most highly trusted covert personnel this suggests the infeasibility of the use of military units for any aspect of the contrived situation
5087087 the only area remaining for ration then would be to bribe one of castros subordinate commanders to initiate an attack on the u s naval base at guantanamo
5087088 a possible scenario whereby an attack on a united states reconnaissance aircraft could be exploited toward the end of effecting the removal of the castro regime
5087089 t he u s could undertake various measures designed to stimulate the cubans to provoke a new incident
5087090 flaunting our freedom of action hoping to stir the cuban military to action
5087091 depending above all on whether the cubans were or could be made to be trigger happy the development of the initial downing of a reconnaissance plane could lead at best to the elimination of castro perhaps to the removal of soviet troops and the installation of ground inspection in cuba or at the least to our demonstration of firmness on reconnaissance
5087092 we could blow up a u s ship in guantanamo bay and blame cuba casualty lists in u s newspapers cause a helpful wave of indignation
5087093 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5087094 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5087095 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5087096 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5087097 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5087098 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5087099 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5087100 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5087101 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5087102 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5087103 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5087104 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5087105 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5087106 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5087107 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5087108 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5087109 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5087110 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5087111 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5087112 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5087113 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5087114 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5087115 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5087116 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5087117 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5087118 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5087119 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5087120 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5087121 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5087122 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5087123 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5087124 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5087125 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5087126 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5087127 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5087128 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5087129 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5087130 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5087131 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5087132 who are open to doing something on the production side
5087133 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5087134 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5087135 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5087136 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5087137 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5087138 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5087139 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5087140 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5087141 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5087142 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5087143 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5087144 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5087145 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5087146 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5087147 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5087148 the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem
5087149 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5087150 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5087151 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5087152 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5087153 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5087154 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5087155 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5087156 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5087157 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5087158 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5087159 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5087160 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5087161 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5087162 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5087163 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5087164 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5087165 emphasizes that the followers of jesus were called to participate in their world as local communities of an alternative society to the roman imperial order
5087166 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5087167 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5087168 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5087169 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5087170 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5087171 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5087172 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5087173 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5087174 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5087175 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
5087176 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5087177 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue its immoral to keep kicking the can down the road for younger generations to grapple
5087178 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5087179 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5087180 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5087181 theres no way i can pay you back but my plan is to show you that i understand
5087182 okay now the shit is really sinking in we aint just divorced we aint even fucking friends
5087183 up to now there has been just a very light off and on rainfall so much so that last night the people continued celebrating carnival
5087184 traffic is reported to be bumper to bumper but is flowing smoothly albeit slowly
5087185 conformity to the rules of right conduct moral or virtuous conduct
5087186 and it came to pass while the ark abode in kirjathjearim that the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of israel lamented after the lord
5087187 blessed is the man whom thou chastenest correcteth o lord and teachest him out of thy law
5087188 and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks

5087190 there are opportunities to be there for people who are reaching out for help
5087191 people get wrapped up in not wanting to violate the persons trust
5087192 but you have to take action if you dont take action and they do hurt themselves or someone else you have to live with that for the rest of your life
5087193 threatening to do that happens a lot more than you think
5087194 everyone knew she had a drug problem but nobody did anything
5087195 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5087196 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5087197 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5087198 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5087199 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5087200 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5087201 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5087207 public sector workers dont understand why the government is not raising wages to match inflation there is a disconnection between expectations and what the government delivers and so there is discontent

5087209 saudi arabia is about to enter an era where there is no middle class you will either find extremely rich people or extremely poor people unfortunately
5087210 we are passing through a very critical stage you are talking about a state with more than a billion dollars every 24 hours they can buy anyone
5087211 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
5087212 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
5087213 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
5087214 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
5087215 u s workers are poised to take a more proactive role in planning for their financial future and are turning to their employers for help

5087226 our speaker got up and just praised brian we were all excited about it
5087227 she was almost running on the spot she was so excited
5087228 weve been very much praying for him and his team
5087229 she was yelling and they were all screaming in the background and they were having a great time and totally celebrating and taking it all in

5087234 the fact that b c athletes have contributed to more than one half of canadas total medals so far is a source of pride for all british columbians
5087235 its quite an honour to have an olympian in the family
5087236 i salute the archbishop and bishops of africa for resisting disorientation and a decadent culture which he said was being passed by western nations
5087237 dont fear resist and do not compromise on that it is a danger not only to the believers but to the whole of africa it is bad if our children become complacent and think that people who are not in order are alright
5087238 these foreigners should go and practice their nonsense elsewhere that is the minimum demand
5087239 when i learnt that the bishop was being consecrated i thought of shoes for the bishop since walking is now outdated i thought i should give him a car which is parked outside

5087250 we are going to carry out retrenchment because of the inefficiency of many personnel in various ministries many people are not effective and there is no reason why we should retain them
5087251 we need a certain number of workers given our resources there is no need to have over three workers in a department with the same qualifications performing the same duty that is wastage of resources and it bars others who are competent
5087252 today the work which needs five people can be done by one computer operated by one individual or two this implies that many workers are useless many officials are not computer literate which is another reason for disqualification
5087253 we need people who will do the right job and service and deliver in the allocated time frame expected by the public those will be retained
5087254 public offices deal with common people there is a lot of bureaucracy which delays services we want to reverse this so that people can be served efficiently

5087268 well there is a cease fire and russia is currently not in compliance with that cease fire although they have just this morning announced that their troops will begin to withdraw and withdraw fully and completely back to the lines prior to this conflict tomorrow on monday
5087269 in fact the fact that russian troops are in georgian cities the fact that they are at the port of poti back and forth in that port along the east west highway is simply not acceptable and it has nothing to do obviously with the conflict that began in south ossetia thats why russian troops need to withdraw fully completely back to their aug t 6 7 lines

5087276 johnson told me that he never anticipated the vitriolic response his blog post would produce
5087277 the downside of globalisation is scarcity in other words what is the point of shipping materials all over the globe if you can relocate production just as easily it is better for the environment and a high standard of quality is guaranteed and who would know more about processing bamboo than a japanese craftsman and an added bonus for the consumer the cost price is kept as low as possible

5087406 i suspect the undeserved image of the school is what ultimately led to the dramatic drop in the school roll

5087409 when i was there i think a lot of mastertonians expected makoura to be rough because of the part of town its in
5087410 for those of us who actually were enrolled at the school this idea was laughable
5087411 this is a very emotional subject for current and ex pupils
5087412 for those of us moved by the news of the possible closure its easy to let our affection for makoura overtake the more serious issue of education
5087413 if makoura closes it will be a great loss for the wairarapa

5087417 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5087418 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5087419 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5087420 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5087421 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5087422 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5087423 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5087424 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5087425 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5087426 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5087427 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5087428 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5087429 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5087430 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5087431 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5087432 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5087433 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5087434 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5087435 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5087436 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5087437 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5087438 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5087439 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5087440 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5087441 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5087442 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5087443 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5087444 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5087445 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5087446 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis

5087450 this is a gesture to abu mazen and the palestinian people for the upcoming month of ramadan

5087452 we welcome the release of any palestinian prisoner it is considered a victory for palestinians
5087453 we ask israeli to change its conditions for releasing prisoners and we ask for the release of all prisoners without exception

5087457 we have three mayors in thane district thane kalyan dombivili and ambernath in badlapur our ally bjp is ruling ulhasnagar is the only place in the thane ambernath belt where sena does not have any power it would have been a rare achievement for the party if we had got the post of mayor there as well

5087464 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem

5087500 there have been cases where models are booked way ahead of a shoot and then they turn up two months later looking less healthy and perhaps a bit underweight we wouldnt be happy showing them that way so it is then that we would need that person to look a little bit fuller
5087501 altering models bodies to appear fuller figured proves that the industry acknowledges there is a serious issue with projecting images of very thin models but it is missing the point
5087502 they should be using naturally healthy models in the first instance instead of having to make them look that way

5087505 its a setback losing to the dutch but its not a major one well go away and learn from it
5087506 definitely our heads arent down we had some really good chances against the dutch and just didnt put them away
5087507 but i think we can put it together win the china game and go in with confidence knowing that we can beat the netherlands if we do meet them again
5087508 we play every game like its the last game were going to play so we wont go into it any different in our mindset
5087509 it game against china definitely puts us under a bit of pressure but im sure well be able to do it

5087552 now he thinks that natalie heard the dinghy banging loosely against the splendor went to fix it and slipped on the swim step knocking herself unconscious and rolled into the water and the dinghy just floated away
5087553 there was no conspiracy nobody walking in on something sexual nothing absurd like that
5087554 he writes that he went through the inquest in a daze and after that he took to his bed for eight days in a catatonic state blaming himself for her death hes never entirely recovered but how can you
5087555 i have no doubt hes going to bring home the gold
5087556 im gonna kinda sneak up under the radar and drop some bombs on them
5087557 before athens i was running 20 3s and then at the nationals the u s olympic trials i ran my fastest time ever of 19 88 seconds in the first round and finished with a 19 99 seconds in the final
5087558 this year i finished with a 19 86 seconds so its telling me im in better shape than i thought i was because i was skeptical coming into the trials this year
5087559 we can do this thing thats what i always tell him
5087560 ill say there goes my baby right there there he goes
5087561 i think hes going to win the gold in the 200
5087562 he is just the finest young man we call him the athlete and the gentleman
5087563 there will come a time when within a single generation we will develop one or possibly even two new ideas current advancements in the bow and arrow industries suggest an exponential trend in the expansion of our technological capacities we are able to perform hunts in a fraction of the time it took our ancestors thus freeing up valuable time to think of new ideas in the post simian world we may develop into a species that is not only intellectually superior to our current state but capable of feats beyond the comprehension of a contemporary simian
5087564 the ability to store memories and thoughts outside our brains onto physical media perhaps on flattened tree bark
5087565 as technological progress outpaces biology new selective pressures will arise that will force our species to evolve mentally and physically beyond what we are now this is the same trend that gave rise to our own intelligent species but it will only accelerate in the coming generations our new environment increasingly favors higher dexterity and intelligence and so the true post simian will not be an ape at all it will share some similarities with the modern ape but at the same time possess capacities far beyond our comprehension the thought capacity of a single post simian could be greater than the combined brains of every ape in the world

5087568 importunity is the pressing of our desires upon god with urgency and perseverance the praying with that tenacity and tension which neither relaxes nor ceases until its plea is heard and its cause is won
5087569 the praying which influences god is declared to be that of the fervent effectual outpouring of a righteous man that is to say it is prayer on fire having no feeble flickering flame no momentary flash but shining with a vigorous and steady glow

5087571 as soon as you tell them you are a patient of dr paskon they look at you like you are dirt and treat you like you are a bum
5087572 the other doctors tell me they will not see me because i was a patient of his paskon
5087573 i think he really cares about his patients i know he had some bad patients that abused the fact he was sympathetic but there are always some bad apples in a bunch he saw corrections officers police officers the elderly this doctor is not a bad person
5087574 no one will take us i dont abuse drugs i didnt go to him so i could get drugs yet in the eyes of others i went to him because i wanted to get drugs that wasnt the case
5087575 how can i get those when they are sealed by the feds government
5087576 she advised me to go to an advanced pain management center but for medicaid you have to have a doctors referral to go to one of those
5087577 i had called his office for about a week and never got anybody to answer
5087578 i then started calling around and it was my pharmacy that told me what was going on i actually called his paskons wife this morning wednesday she said he is devastated by all of this and is worried about his patients i am totally against the government stepping in and running doctors the government is causing pain and suffering for all of his patients
5087579 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
5087580 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
5087581 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
5087582 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
5087583 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
5087584 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
5087585 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
5087586 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
5087587 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
5087588 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
5087589 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning
5087590 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico

5087597 there are a few reasons the first in helping the people the government did not make a big show we are pragmatic and do what is necessary we did not talk too much about it but because of this perhaps some people feel we have not done what we should do
5087598 the government cannot give hongbaos every year but fortunately this year we have the budget surplus to do it
5087599 the second possible reason is that our assistance is indirect
5087600 the governments response may not be as quick but i think we are not stupid before jack neos film appeared we have already adopted various measures to alleviate the impact of the erp
5087601 it is also important for families to be frugal and exercise financial discipline
5087602 the families feel less stressed because they now know how to cope with financial difficulties
5087603 an unthinking fascination with the icons and imagery of the third reich

5087606 in other words out of the husband and wife only one of the two will be replaced
5087607 so the population will be halved in another generation out of four old people only one baby after a few generations no more to reduce
5087608 in the old days the men were the masters of the households and they even take three or four wives that was widely accepted and something that must be done otherwise you may have some problems
5087609 singapore was also the same even up to the 50s and 60s it was not legal but it happened but that era has gone the modern day women expects equality
5087610 perhaps their social circles were too narrow they were too busy in work or perhaps they were not good at chasing the opposite sex
5087611 we do not have parental matchmaking sessions in singapore i think our peoples association should consider organising similar sessions
5087612 of course these are personal problems and you must work hard at it the government will only work at the side but we will try to facilitate
5087613 i want everyone to abide by the law we will take action against those who incite racial hatred or those who overreact

5087632 if they stop fulfilling their function now then who will ensure security there we will stick firmly to the provisions of the treaty of 1992 which defines the procedure and tasks of our peacekeepers in conflict zones
5087633 concerning the possibility of bringing peacekeepers from other countries into the peacekeeping force well have to wait for a political decision to be made
5087634 one thing is clear though the president has said that the georgian troops definitely wont be part of the peacekeeping force after they did what they did both south ossetia and abkhazia strongly object to their involvement and russia will honour their objection in fact russia shares their position

5087648 we dont believe that we have set the ultimate standard here

5087650 we demonstrated that devices could be automatically recognised by the network to move forward requires the manufacturers of home network enabled devices to agree on a number of standards

5087655 niemand kon het geloven dat peaches faris badwan haar ex uitnodigde zodra ze weer thuis was laat staan dat ze hem bij haar thuis de nacht zou laten doorbrengen
5087656 ze waren kort voor ze naar las vegas vertrok nog een koppel dan trouwt ze zonder aankondiging met een ander komt ze terug en belt ze hem op alsof dat de normaalste zaak van de wereld is ze leeft in een luchtbel en is dol op de aandacht die ze krijgt maar nu ze getrouwd is wordt het tijd dat ze volwassen wordt
5087657 het is een frisse start hij heeft zijn besluit genomen hij houdt van me en hij gaat weg bij zijn vrouw
5087658 ze hebben via een vriend al een huis gevonden waar ze verliefd op zijn geworden er zit een huurcontract van anderhalf jaar op en dat is een teken van hun verbintenis ze willen zelfs een puppy kopen
5087659 hij is er woest over we hebben er vier of vijf keer over de telefoon over gesproken en dat was moeilijk we zijn het er over eens dat we elkaar persoonlijk moeten ontmoeten
5087660 ik ben erg nerveus maar volgens peaches komt het allemaal goed
5087661 dat weet je pas als je de plaat in handen hebt de ruwe demos liggen nu bij haar
5087662 he has now made two of the biggest divorce payments in showbiz history
5087663 at least no one can accuse him of leaving his ex wives short
5087664 these are dirty tactics it is a malicious campaign on their part and is completely immoral
5087665 they accuse others first because later they want to do it
5087666 you can see the dirty tricks beginning in their campaign it is corrupt and immoral to use religion and the quran
5087667 dont insult the religion of islam by playing political games
5087668 they will probably try to convince voters that islam is under threat and that malay rights are under threat

5087672 i spoke to popov and he said he could not get to the office because his car had a flat tyre
5087673 this was preposterous i said the delegation must have more cars he said there was another car but its tyre was flat too at this point i knew it was a trap and i was very angry
5087674 he said we must declare a unilateral ceasefire before the russians could push the south ossetians back
5087675 i will not bow to the call from protesters and several other groups of people urging me to resign or dissolve the house
5087676 i will continue to look after this country as the prime minister

5087678 it is apparent that the old mosques need a new lease on life

5087681 dr yaacob will work out the details and announce the specific proposals this week
5087682 the madrasahs are not part of the state school system so it would be difficult to justify government funding however there is merit in tapping the broader malay muslim community for support
5087683 you should continue to participate in other grassroots activities the mosques too should organise events with other community organisations

5087685 so portable medical insurance means that workers can carry the policies wherever they go and receive insurance cover
5087686 but bear in mind the medi shield plan is a key factor that provides basic healthcare for everyone in singapore already
5087687 so there are many different alternatives and options to address the issue of workers healthcare
5087688 more guidelines and advisory especially in the offshore and marine industry
5087689 requires us to rethink our framework and introduce new measures and help industries inculcate this culture of safety

5087700 i wasnt born in singapore but do you doubt my loyalty and commitment
5087701 it doesnt mean that we should look at them differently because theyre not born and brought up in singapore
5087702 the important thing is that they have embraced singapore and want to be a part of it and they wanted so badly to win a medal for our country
5087703 we should not be harping on where they are born i hope mindsets change
5087704 my reply to the critics is do you have a better solution if you do please come forward to help us achieve more

5087708 i was in contact with one of the owners and he was clear that we had some money and could spend for me it is clear they are supporting me
5087709 my commitment to the club is 100 per cent i have said a hundred times that my family are really happy here and i want to win trophies for liverpool
5087710 its a special day for singapore thats why im here
5087711 i came from my home in bukit batok which is quite a distance away but you could say im caught up in table tennis fever i only came to singapore early this year but my sister has been here for about 10 years so singapore is like my second home
5087712 we just wanted to get a bit of thesingapore experience
5087713 we initially wanted to go to clarke quay to watch the match there but heard about this so were here
5087714 i watched the semi finals on friday in the locker room of my work place
5087715 today i came with my friend to watch the match over dinner
5087716 its an exciting match but im so busy i just catch what i can
5087717 singapore is pretty much home for me and think this performance is great for sports in this country
5087718 these girls are representing singapore and theyre helping take the sport to another level
5087719 i am very proud of the table tennis team and it really shouldnt matter that they were from china
5087720 we are a 43 year old immigrant society and the three athletes took up our flag theyre singaporeans
5087721 its hard to produce top class athletes here simply because everyone is concerned about their careers and finances
5087722 we should celebrate this show of sporting excellence i am also very proud of tao li
5087723 its appropriate that chelsea are playing on the other screen were like chelsea taking the short cut to buying success
5087724 these table tennis players were recognised players before they came here but tao li is quite a different case she sort of grew up in singapore is going to school here i think thats fair
5087725 alarmed shocked disappointed these were the emotions that went through me when hundreds of people surrounded my vehicle about midnight yesterday the mob saw me andreacted in a threatening manner they banged on the windows of my vehicle rocked and kicked it the four of us in the vehicle kept our composure and remained silent despite being taunted by the mob with vulgarities that would make a sailor blush
5087726 what happened last night showed that some people would do anything to instil fear in the people during the by election
5087727 such rowdy behaviour was uncalled for the incident is an embarrassment to our nation as this is not the first by election that we are having
5087728 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title
5087729 is finishing 12th and winning the league cup a successful season for us i dont think so
5087730 you see the real quality of a team after 38 games in the league cup or the fa cup if you win five games you can be inthe final does that tell you the real quality no because real quality only comes out in the premiership
5087731 if you dont win the league of course you are frustrated but the standards are very high possibly the highest in the world and two or three points is not a big gap
5087732 we finished with 83 points last season everywhere else in europe that would have made us champions
5087733 we lost only three games last season and we have a stability in our club which means we can keep improving
5087734 there are some things i still want to do i want to raise the bar in swimming more
5087735 i heard there were 70 000 people who stayed on after the cincinnati reds game in the us on friday night to watch the 100m fly on the jumbotron
5087736 four years ago there was no way that would have happened
5087737 i guess im just fortunate to win the close ones
5087738 liquor is allowed by their religion so we allow them
5087739 we have to understand the political reality that we are part of an alliance and we do not have absolute power under such a government we focus on universal islamic values like fighting corruption
5087740 we trust that there will be a conclusion very soon there are issues that are outstanding but quite clearly one has no business in negotiating if you are not prepared to compromise
5087741 it is critical that we conclude this dialogue as a matter of urgency

5087753 concerns over chinas export health will translate into a complete reversal of the current tightening policy maintaining economic growth is now the no 1 priority
5087754 china needs much faster growth than an average western country as it has to generate 10 million jobs a year
5087755 eight per cent growth in china is equivalent to a recession below 9 per cent would make the authorities quite nervous
5087756 since 2004 double digit economic growth has been taken for granted
5087757 without this firepower we would be very negative on both china and commodities said mr andrew garthwaite an economist at credit suisse

5087759 while discrimination might be low small pockets of the workforce could be facing challenges in employment search because of their age gender or marital status et cetera both workers and employers lose when there is workplace discrimination while the worker is denied a fair opportunity the employer limits his pool of possible talent and the chance of recruiting the best person for the job
5087760 i didnt want to do english programmes because i felt that it would take away your privacy completely
5087761 they said it might be a trade advertisement then it came out and everyone was watching it
5087762 my experience allows me to impart my knowledge to my students
5087763 ive also gotten some of them to act on tv
5087764 the reality is that sia has now grown to be such a large airline that we can no longer operate from a single terminal we are the fourth largest international airline were looking at an airport facility that must project the growth were seeing in aviation and air travel in our region for the next 20 years
5087765 many airlines split their operations between terminals as the airlines grow and airports become international hubs
5087766 vamos a volver para nuestro mundo de luz ella se refiere a la tierra o sea a pesar de que los campos el seos estaban siendo vueltos a escombros por la muerte de hades ella tiene el poder suficiente para regresar a sus caballeros de vuelta a la tierra
5087767 it is difficult to justify the extraordinary generous taxpayer contribution they are forced to pay into top mandarins schemes
5087768 let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me
5087769 the national football team will stay at a private hotel
5087770 i have no idea about the reasons but it must be because they want to be more focused on the game against brazil
5087771 in the end they do not treat us footballers as well as people think
5087772 ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu the whole afternoon seemed light hearted
5087773 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
5087774 the ones to get hit in manufacturing are always the production workers
5087775 definitely the foreign workers will be hit harder than locals as locals tend to take on supervisory roles supervisory roles only gets affected by a second round of job cuts if the economic situation gets worse
5087776 at the end of the day its worth it because you retain your core skills its going to cost you a lot more if the downturn is only for a short while and you have to start up again with higher costs
5087777 we wish to strengthen our research so we can provide good feedback to our government thats a very important role we must play so that we can arrive at a win win situation
5087778 it was everybody catching up with bolt hes a legend in his own right the guys a phenomenal athlete hes a freak of nature
5087779 i cant believe a human being can run so fast
5087780 both asafa powell former world record holder 9 74s and bolt are so streamlined i dont know if this is nature or superior planning and coaching
5087781 this guy has proven that 9 50s is possible maybe even 9 40s hes so relaxed thats the secret
5087782 weve been very strict on this we want to stress no advertising its a good tradition we protect the companies that are involved
5087783 putting tapes over the logos is about assuaging sponsors little tantrums not about actually protecting a brand
5087784 one must first remove the fallen trees then tidy up the house and cellar and in the third phase bring the shine back to the house
5087785 and i hope that we can end this quickly maybe by year end to bring the shine back to the house that would take based on experience two to three years
5087786 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it will take a few days before i realise im the olympic champion
5087787 but this is for sure the biggest moment in my career in my life i will never forget this moment
5087788 having three russian girls left standing in the olympics is a huge moment for russia
5087789 i know we were expecting and planning for some medals but i dont think anyone could expect three medals from the girls so this is really big moment for russia
5087790 he needed a couple of games initially to build up his match fitness and now he is displaying the ability to help win us games
5087791 we have started to understand each others style better overthe past few games and i amlooking forward to improving this relationship
5087792 hes a quality player whos motivated and works hard in training though he played well in the last few matches i dont think we have seen the best from him yet
5087793 well if it really was then it is all thanks to how the team has played
5087794 im just happy to be back with saffc especially with all the support my team mates and the club have shown me
5087795 it doesnt matter that they lost im still very proud of them because they still won the silver
5087796 if i had to score them i would give them 100 points
5087797 i think they have already performed to the best of their abilities
5087798 success is possible with what weve been able to do with some of the sports building the systems in training and preparation for the young to excel
5087799 of course it requires singaporeans with talent and also with the dedication and commitment if we can match all this together we can maintain this kind of success
5087800 we want to continue developing talent be it local or foreign one way is to get kids started playing at the kindergartens
5087801 hopefully this olympic medal will also help change parents mindsets we dont want them having the idea that if their children sacrifice so much for table tennis and dont have a degree at the end theyll lose out
5087802 obviously i was pleased to score three tries myself but i was also pleased that the boys picked up from last weeks game against north harbour
5087803 im pleased with how ive been playing but for me to play well i need the boys to lay a good platform weve been doing it well across the park so far which gives me the opportunity to play well
5087804 i was particularly pleased with our defence tonight harbour got away on us a little bit last week so it was one of the things that we wanted to focus on
5087805 i was really pleased with the effort over 80 minutes this week the boys never took their foot off the gas throughout the match and it was good to see a bit of ruthlessness we never let up on them at any time during the game
5087806 i thought the young boys did well and im pleased for them the challenge for them now is to see if they can back that up week in and week out but not to take anything away from them i thought they did well
5087807 theyre a good side and at this stage were just taking it one match at a time im pleased with how weve been playing but its a long season so were not getting carried away just yet
5087808 our women table tennis team making the finals had left me with a small problem after thinking it over and discussing with my colleagues we decided on this solution
5087809 we now have tao li reaching the swimming finals and the table tennis team playing for either gold or silver team singapore all the way
5087810 we were up against a very strong chinese team the singapore team had done us proud
5087811 our paddlers have done very well and have done singapore proud please thank them for us and also the whole singapore team you have carried our flag high
5087812 its been a long time since weve had a medal at the olympics there were high hopes and they have not disappointed us
5087813 it is not just a few players but the whole team the support the training and also the encouragement and the morale boost they get from knowing that the whole of singapore was watching and rooting for them i think that made all the difference
5087814 non electronic exports may cushion some of the drag in tech exports but growth in the pharmaceutical sector could remain volatile
5087815 july may see some moderation in the year on year declines but the general outlook remains bearish
5087816 i can honestly say i definitely will not be there in four years time
5087817 whether i go on a little bit longer i will wait and see but i definitely wont be going to london
5087818 i will see over the next few weeks where i take my swimming from here
5087819 to get second is great but three in a row would have been nice
5087820 for me i was able to come so close and within millimetres of doing it the thing is i can walk away absolutely happy because i have given it everything i have
5087821 it is a mixture of emotions a little bit relieved a little bit of disappointment i spent every last cent that i had
5087822 i gave it everything today it was a hard race im a little bit tired the heat swim was the second fastest 1500 i have ever done thats life and i have no regrets
5087823 the people who will plan our opening ceremony do this for a living theyre the very best around at arranging pop concerts and directing west end shows and theyre british they looked at that and thought thats really good but we can do something as good set in a different context they were more pumped up because it was so good
5087824 but my judgment is youll not see another games like this again
5087825 of course it will be in london but it is important the whole of the uk shares in it there are lots of things i think we can do which are quite instinctive to us anyway what does the world know about us were actually quite good at partying lets turn it into a giant party
5087826 we can go further on so many fronts good example green issues
5087827 it is about creativity coming to london is not just going to be a sporting experience its the whole the cultural whole sure it is about sport but we will also take the chance to showcase the creative capital that london is and fun lets have a bit of fun with this
5087828 the pro stock motorcycles are the quickest reacting vehicles on the premises
5087829 if you hold back youre late and if dont hold back you go red
5087830 all we can do is keep holding our heads up weve got a great team with great sponsors and a championship winning bike i just need to step up to the plate and be a championship driver we just got to keep it green
5087831 this is great news thanks be to the lord and our virgin mary of lourdes
5087832 when a better class of tourists than nowadays led to the establishment of the first night clubs and restaurants in malta
5087833 in a previous life his soul was like a rock now its more like a feather a heavy feather

5087837 you dont want to have to depend on someone else to do your dirty work you want to go out there and take the guy out thats in front of you in points we had a shot to move up to the no 2 position in the standings and we just let it get away from us
5087838 it was a very good race antron and i both basically just guessed at the starting lights but you have to take chances sometimes as a driver and that was one of those times we both had to do our jobs it was very close all the way from start to finish they just came out on the better end
5087839 i told crew chief mike green and the guys not to hang their heads the
5087840 im down a little bit but at the same time i have to look at the whole picture were in the countdown were very solid in the point standings and were going to look good going into indy im looking forward to that
5087841 now that weve clinched a place in the countdown we can continue to implement some of these things weve been trying to test for later in the season
5087842 i feel very good going into the u s nationals in two weeks were in the showdown 100 000 bonus event that weekend and we have a very tough match up first round with points leader tim wilkerson there i feel like we have a great car going into indy

5087844 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5087845 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5087846 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5087847 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5087848 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5087849 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5087850 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5087851 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5087852 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5087853 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5087854 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5087855 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5087856 im independent now i stand on my own two feet
5087857 i have a job i work i earn in fact im living on my own which isnt an easy thing to do for a woman in pakistan for a lone woman to survive
5087858 every thought we think changes our biochemistry your hormones are all effected by your thoughts pay attention to things that bring you joy when i read the newspaper i look for the good news
5087859 we fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 p m and 11 39 p m on friday which successfully intercepted a stretch of rain belt from moving towards the stadium
5087860 under such a weather condition a small bubble in the rain cloud would have triggered rainfall let alone a lightening
5087861 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares we get pretty busy at the track sometimes
5087862 your last reason for wanting to come to london is so serious that i am unwilling to oppose it yet you must remember that your image of worshipping once a year in a certain place in imitation of the jews boswell had said it was like going up to jerusalem is but a comparison and simile non est idem the likeness of something is not the same thing as itself if the annual resort to jerusalem was a duty to the jews it was a duty because it was commanded and you have no such command and therefore no such duty it may be dangerous to receive too readily and indulge too fondly opinions from which perhaps no pious mind is wholly disengaged of local sanctity and local devotion you know what strange effects they have produced over a great part of the christian world i am now writing and you when you read this are reading under the eye of omnipresence to what degree fancy is to be admitted into religious offices it would require much deliberation to determine i am far from intending totally to exclude it fancy is a faculty bestowed by our creator and it is reasonable that all his gifts should be used to his glory that all our faculties should co operate in worship but they are to co operate according to the will of him that gave them according to the order which his wisdom has established as ceremonies prudential or convenient are less obligatory than positive ordinances as bodily worship is only the token to others or ourselves of mental adoration so fancy is always to act in subordination to reason we may take fancy for a companion but must follow reason as our guide we may allow fancy to suggest certain ideas in certain places but reason must always be heard when she tells us that those ideas and those places have no natural or necessary relation when we enter a church we habitually recall to mind the duty of adoration but we must not omit adoration for want of a temple because we know and ought to remember that the universal lord is everywhere present and that therefore to come to iona or to jerusalem though it may be useful cannot be necessary
5087863 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5087864 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5087865 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5087866 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

5087868 today i was very very nervous because i was the favourite to win the tournament
5087869 in a final if you play your best you can win for sure but i think today i played more with my mind than my body
5087870 lord you are enough you have been so good i am so thankful for the daily bread you send milk and honey will come i know but for today i thank you for sending enough i thank you for being enough i am sorry for my ungratefulness i am sorry for taking and not being still enough to say thank you each day i will be more thankful for what you have done i am so thankful for you lord jesus
5087871 oh the wonderful cross oh the wonderful cross bids me come and die and find that i may truly live oh the wonderful cross oh the wonderful cross all who gather here by grace draw near and bless your name
5087872 we just couldnt get track position when we needed it thats all it was a track position race when you got behind somebody it washed out the front end it was real difficult to pass especially when you were in a pack of traffic we made up as much ground on the track as possible and we made up even more on pit road so overall it was a successful day the way the race played out a 12th place finish is the most we could have expected
5087873 when you go to the racetrack youre no 1 priority is to win
5087874 we might not be happy with finishing 12th but were certainly satisfied marcos drove a smart race no matter how good you are nobody wins every week good teams however make the most of their situations we did that its days like this that defines a top 10 team
5087875 we put so much downforce in the car we sacrificed a little speed
5087876 that made it difficult to pass theres a fine line between comfort and speed our kingsford car really handled well in traffic but we didnt have enough speed to get through it but still it was a good day for our team and a good day for the points
5087877 ambrose will move to the bristol motor speedway for friday nights food city 250
5087878 hopefully we can get out of bristol with the same kind of effort we had at michigan
5087879 if we do it will be another victory for this race team

5087882 serious doubts exists as to whether these verses belong to the gospel of mark
5087883 what a day if my chiropractor had been here he might have told me to pull out so im glad he wasnt
5087884 after all ive been through i was going to finish no matter what
5087885 i started pretty well but then struggled on the back nine
5087886 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5087887 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5087888 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5087889 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5087890 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5087891 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5087892 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5087893 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5087894 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5087895 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5087896 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5087897 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5087898 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5087899 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5087900 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5087901 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5087902 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5087903 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5087904 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5087905 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5087906 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5087907 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5087908 it was bothering him at the point where he needed to get it checked out
5087909 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5087910 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5087911 i just heard mary saying let the hunter the name of their boat go just let it run
5087912 we knew romania would be good theyve just won gold in the pair we worked together as one i feel similar to how i did after athens after we won silver i had no regrets but i wondered what would happen if i work every day for four years and this is it this time i feel complete
5087913 failure by the large financial firms in the concern to adequately take on a tear over the impact of dweller policies on the worlds finances
5087914 failure by the large financial firms in the concern to adequately take venture into account connected with the battleful financial policies of the large economy in the world have led not exclusive to joint losses
5087915 the revenues of our bureaucrats from debased activity according to experts account for digit third of our domestic budget
5087916 we already wager concerns about the high outlay of living with the massive uprise in the toll of fuel and commodities
5087917 if you add to that a momentous increase in the outlay of transport of the merchandise that makes up our everyday lives from toys to mobile phones or televisions open instrument will surely be against it
5087918 its country whether it be 30 dollars 50 dollars or 80 dollars per container that will be passed down to the consumer governments wont be handing discover some presents
5087919 hat mich dieses mal wieder einiges an nerven gekostet ich habe mir zwar gerade einen haufen an charms bestellt jedoch ist mein momentaner bestand nicht sonderlich gro ich habe meine karte aber nat rlich trozzdem gemacht
5087920 die kinder auf dem motiv m ssen ja nicht passend zu der umgebung angezogen sein auf fotos passen die klamotten ja auch nicht immer zum hintergrund
5087921 was a bit difficult for me because i just bought some new charms but i dont have many here at this time
5087922 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5087923 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5087924 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5087925 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5087926 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5087927 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5087928 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5087929 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5087930 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5087931 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5087932 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5087933 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5087934 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5087935 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5087936 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5087937 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5087938 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5087939 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5087940 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5087941 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5087942 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5087943 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5087944 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5087945 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5087946 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5087947 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5087948 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5087949 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5087950 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5087951 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5087952 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy

5088132 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade

5088168 um resultado at normal fora de casa o que eu n o gostei foi da postura da equipe ap tica o goi s atacou de forma natural n o teve uma press o absurda e a postura do n utico provocou isso mas n o vou tirar os m ritos do goi s n o fez tr s gols meteu bolas na trave e poderia ter feito mais
5088169 acho que o resultado positivo d mais moral para toda a equipe at a torcida come a a comparecer com mais peso e isso nos fortalece come amos com o p direito e esperamos que isso se mantenha nos pr ximos jogos
5088170 n s fizemos um jogo sobrando isso precisa ser exaltado constru mos chances jogamos pelos dois lados usamos piv e conseguimos atuar por dentro tudo isso funcionou e nos d perspectivas positivas para a seq ncia da competi o

5088172 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5088173 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
5088174 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
5088175 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
5088176 im concerned with the way the attorney general frames the problem
5088177 he talks about arbitrary or irrelevant differences between criminal and national security investigations but these were corrections originally designed to prevent the type of overreach the fbi engaged in for years
5088178 nobodys complaining about the fbi collecting domestic intelligence when its appropriate and authorized under the law
5088179 what the attorney general is doing is expanding the bureaus intelligence collection without addressing the mismanagement within the fbi if you have an agency collecting more with less oversight its only going to get worse

5088184 i would never have applied to san francisco school of the arts without baycat

5088186 leasing means that we can stay up to date with the latest technology
5088187 my main goal has always been for students to understand the basics of team building gaining social skills in terms of working together as a team
5088188 last semester we not only had groups working on the show we had departments we had a creative department a graphics department and an editing department working in different teams people got to see what their strengths and weaknesses were
5088189 they had to attend an orientation which included safe surfing concepts described our core values explained our watchdog policies and ended with the signing of a safe surfing pledge
5088190 the time spent one on one reviewing surfing habits with the teens was great for our mentoring relationships with the kids

5088195 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
5088196 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
5088197 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
5088198 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
5088199 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
5088200 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
5088201 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5088202 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
5088203 let vs make man in our image according to our likenes
5088204 and the ribbe which the lorde god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her to the man 23 then the man said this now is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shalbe called woman because she was taken out of man

5088208 our mission is to really give people the tools and information they need to improve their own lives
5088209 for example kentucky was extremely early and whole hog into it and the reason was that the state wanted to create a competitive edge for its people
5088210 i found this particularly helpful in seeing how they viewed issues that i know were currently affecting the county
5088211 this chat gave me the confidence and ease to be able to ask my doctor things that i wouldnt have dreamed of
5088212 i think that when you have an energetic kid in front of you
5088213 dedicated to raising awareness of the importance of after school programs and advocating for quality affordable programs for all children
5088214 and id never really understood that there was such a disparity
5088215 i strongly believe that in the next 10 years there wont be a job that doesnt require the use of a computer in some way
5088216 and anyone who doesnt have access to that technology now is going to fall behind there is no reason that the next bill gates isnt in one of those jamaican schools
5088217 this buying from a refurbisher seemed to solve two problems at once
5088218 which is that there are 35 million computers thrown away every year in the u s and at the same time there are 4 billion people in the developing world that dont have access to computers
5088219 there are 752 schools in jamaica and almost all of them needed computers
5088220 to side with one side over the other is a recipe for disaster because youre only going to get to half of the population
5088221 i think part of the reason we were successful was because we were teenagers coming in from the u s with no axe to grind
5088222 i always liken it to a soccer team thats out on the field and ready to play and were just putting the ball down for them
5088223 the fact that we could do it two years ahead of time was a big newsmaker down there
5088224 and gave us a lot of credibility and a lot of momentum
5088225 these are totally different cultures but its still definitely doable

5088249 what is it with these modern artists there was a time around 130 years ago i guess when painters such as vincent van gogh would wander the streets unrepresented by commercial agents and pr people and as a result their work would stand or fall on its artistic merit
5088250 most of the major pr agencies in the uk construct their business around writing strategies drawing up q amp as drafting positioning statements scripting advertorials collating briefing packs printing press kits and countless other bits of waffle that underpin our daily trade this rationalising process gets charged to the clients who in most cases seem happy to pay for it as they have been told that these are necessary building blocks in the construction of the great pr event
5088251 the only annoying thing is when journalists have a pre conceived notion that a pr man is the devil and we are not worthy of sitting at the same table as them there are fewer narrow minded journalists now but it is annoying when some people do not seem to realise that we have anything valid to contribute to a news story or debate

5088269 well im pretty sure now baby pretty soon youre gonna knock em dead
5088270 because he would come and get me and take me for breakfast and we would talk only thing is we never talked about music we talked about everything but music because i think i really hid my talent from him for a long time
5088271 we talked about things from family life to what i wanted to be later in life and what he wanted to be as a grandfather and how he wanted to own a farm and have all his grandkids come and visit
5088272 dad i realize why we had this long drive the other day and the long conversation because i learned more about you in that one day than i had in 21 years
5088273 i think that moment that we shared in so many words he was telling me youre talented and you need to carry on what i started
5088274 well im pretty sure now baby pretty soon youre gonna knock em dead
5088275 might as well im better now than i was then

5088282 yes we are flying it feels good doesnt it stick with me i wont let you down
5088283 all of us stepped into this journey with great faith and great belief that humanity would carry us through from town to town and thats exactly what happened
5088284 for me to walk from leeds to london is probably the single most difficult thing i could ever have imagined
5088285 i still cant quite believe that i have achieved it but i never gave up because of the people that never gave up on me
5088286 yes ive been laying on this trolley for five hours
5088287 mr adams you live in surrey and this hospital is in berkshire
5088288 crew chief bob osborne has been making the right calls and the guys really came through for me
5088289 i knew he was going to hang back to get a run on me but i wasnt going to let that happen
5088290 its good to be locked in but we still have three races left before the chase
5088291 then we have 10 more in the chase to make it happen

5088296 i just feel real confident when i get to the plate right now
5088297 to be able to go out there and crush the ball against a team like detroit was really something
5088298 our entire pitching staff had a bad day and when that happens you are going to get embarrassed
5088299 our offense came ready to win this game but when you give up four runs in three of the first five innings it takes all the wind out of your sails
5088300 i felt good before the game and then before i could blink they had five hits
5088301 i was just shocked they werent all good pitches but they werent all bad either
5088302 hes on an incredible run streak and im just enjoying sitting there and watching it
5088303 everything mora swung at he hit hard and the whole team followed suit

5088314 were feeling really happy and were really at peace now because youre always a little bit nervous before it all takes place
5088315 were really proud of the boys for having worked so hard and having achieved their goal
5088316 when we saw that they started out in that first 500 metres they had a good start i think one of their best speeds we were feeling i think pretty confident that they would be able to do it
5088317 our speaker got up and just praised brian we were all excited about it
5088318 she was almost running on the spot she was so excited
5088319 weve been very much praying for him and his team
5088320 she was yelling and they were all screaming in the background and they were having a great time and totally celebrating and taking it all in
5088321 they were a much much stronger boat this year theyre such a solid group and theyre determined thats all it takes
5088322 we know its a lot of stress and anything can happen for him to hang on and have a little bit of kick left in there is just incredible
5088323 carol is the winner and so then is the whole family and so are we as a community
5088324 these talented athletes are reaching the podium and illustrating the strength and spirit of british columbians who have dedicated their life to reaching the top of their sport
5088325 the fact that b c athletes have contributed to more than one half of canadas total medals so far is a source of pride for all british columbians
5088326 its quite an honour to have an olympian in the family
5088327 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5088328 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5088329 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5088330 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5088331 since knowledge is a consequence of experience its critical that children be engaged in learning activities that nurture their soul expand their interests build upon personal talents and challenge their thinking
5088332 if affluent children enjoy beautiful campuses arts programs interesting literature modern technology field trips carefree recess and teachers who know them i suggest that we create such schools for all children whats good for the sons and daughters of the billionaires should be good enough the rest of the children too
5088333 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5088334 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5088335 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5088336 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5088337 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5088338 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5088339 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5088340 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5088341 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5088342 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5088343 as long as they are not found guilty they remain only accused and there is nothing authorities can do about the couple
5088344 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5088345 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5088346 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5088347 we swore if they go ahead with the execution we will exact vengeance from anyone who performs it
5088348 i think everybody is looking to save money where they can bramlett said
5088349 it takes about a year to build a store and open it she wrote in an email
5088350 we had a few timeslots to fill for 2008 and the developer at the market common made us a very agressive deal to get us open this year wrote the companys real estate broker paul makens in an e mail
5088351 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5088352 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5088353 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5088354 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5088355 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5088356 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5088357 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5088358 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5088359 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5088360 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5088361 there is now cumulative evidence that the economy has entered a cyclical downswing
5088362 these conditions should pressure the boj into lowering its economic assessment further in its monthly economic report
5088363 if the current cyclical downturn turns into a much more severe recession and the economy risks a deflationary spiral the boj could cut rates however we do not attach a high probability to such a scenario given that the economic fundamentals have improved
5088364 the bowstring bridge viaduct at the junction of western boulevard and braunstone gate has been a leicester landmark since the 1890s and is now under imminent threat of demolition
5088365 de montfort university now own the nearby pump amp tap public house and the land surrounding the bridge and are seeking to build a new swimming pool there
5088366 the bridge itself is primarily above the road and does not substantially occupy development land we believe a solution can be found whereby dmu get to build the much needed city centre swimming pool whilst retaining this unique remnant of the great central railway
5088367 dmu have made some important contributions to the regeneration of leicester and we believe this is an opportunity for them to go the extra mile and prove they care about leicester heritage the bridge itself would make a fantastic centrepiece to any new development
5088368 it is not with spurs and i think he is looking for a move
5088369 i think he is a very important player for the club you can see spurs without berbatov are a different team without keane as well they are a different team
5088370 they are huge players it will be very difficult to replace berbatov he is a class player he is not affected by anything around him
5088371 so there are other people involved and when there are other people involved somebody would talk but nobody has
5088372 he had a conversation with my mom and i came back outside and saw my brother get in a truck with lee evans a green pick up truck and drive off
5088373 even one of them alive having made contact in some fashion or form even through a third person hasnt happened
5088374 something happened to them and 30 years later we know its not good else we would know something
5088375 the five black youths never entered the public consciousness the way some white middle class missing children do
5088376 yeah we just had a tornado with 105 mph winds back home
5088377 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5088378 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time
5088379 i can stay quiet when they are right but when they are wrong why should i stay quiet
5088380 they said wooooo when she jumped 4 90 but i jumped this height four years ago it is nothing special
5088381 i know if i do my best it is impossible for someone to beat me
5088382 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5088383 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5088384 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5088385 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5088386 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5088387 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5088388 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5088389 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5088390 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5088391 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5088392 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5088393 well one year led to the next year and now im their olympic coach
5088394 what were trying to do is build a future the future of baseball in china by going to the olympics getting exposure
5088395 and hopefully if we play well then were going to jump start the sport
5088396 and the more they learn about it the more that they become successful when it catches fire its going to be big
5088397 they have great athletes they saw the enormous impact that one man yao ming had on basketball and now they want to do the same thing in baseball
5088398 when they talked about bringing team china back from the dark ages up into the 21st century to be somewhat competitive as the host team of the 08 olympics we thought that lefebvre would be the right guy
5088399 he has the patience he has the love of the game and he wanted to take on that challenge

5088453 john mccain and i fundamentally disagree on how we are gonna move this country forward he ran a negative ad which is most of the ads he runs he ran a negative ad that claimed all my economic plan was was higher taxes and that it would lead to economic disaster
5088454 ive got news for john mccain my plans not gonna bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster from john mccains president george w bush and we cant afford another four years or eight years of george w bush policies and thats why were gonna beat john mccain in this election to put america on a new path
5088455 if barack obama believes his plan will not bring economic disaster he should take issue with nevadas largest newspaper not john mccain
5088456 we havent been passing the credits that are needed for companies to invest in solar power and oh by the way guess what john mccain has opposed these credits in the past and then hes got the nerve to stand up there on television and talk about how he believes in alternative energy
5088457 it was a grind mentally and physically to bear down and make pitches
5088458 the position were in winning series is what were shooting for

5088460 through three at bats i didnt feel too good but i got a hit at the most important part of the game
5088461 if i make the play its a great play if not like today im sure somebody is going to call and say you should have stayed back thats baseball
5088462 those are guys that can swing the bat and hit the ball out of the park so you never know you want to keep tacking on runs when you play a team like that

5088473 the czech game is an important game because i hope to get the answers from the players that i expect
5088474 i have confidence in these players confidence because ive seen the steps weve taken in four friendly matches
5088475 i saw the euros and the other teams and i think we are a very good team i think we will win
5088476 the other managers before me is not important this is my idea and my opinion i know the players very well now
5088477 i think three months ago people never spoke about spain now they are the best team in the world its a miracle
5088478 spain is a very good team they played well but we are a different style and i think we can win against spain why not im very confident in my team
5088479 when i started working with the players they were a bit scared and afraid
5088480 but after that a lot of players have played better
5088481 it was not fear about me it was just very soon after failing to qualify for euro 2008 and for the players it was like an examination or a test now it is different
5088482 i know what these players can do when playing with their clubs there is no losing mentality there is a winning mentality we have to transfer the same mentality to the national team to play with the same confidence
5088483 i think they know me now my style the movement around the pitch that i want they know and it is better now
5088484 only spains fernando torres is a big striker in this moment in the world the others italy so so germany so so portugal no also the french you didnt see anything its a big problem now because the teams defend very well its a problem everywhere
5088485 the charge sheet is ready and can be moved any time along with a resolution of impeachment during this week starting monday however musharraf has the option to resign before the motion is moved

5088490 were executing for the most part in different facets of the game those are still things you must do no matter who youre playing these are games you would like to win but its baseball so you never know
5088491 hitting in front of johan i didnt think i would get too many chances
5088492 were going to try to work through it with him
5088493 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
5088494 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse

5088497 mccain blew obama away and the far left is non to happy about it today
5088498 but you wont hear much about post miles developments in rock influenced electric jazz or the post cecil avant garde at most leading conservatories or in college jazz studies departments
5088499 beyond 2 1 2 unleashing the saxophone by kenny garrett
5088500 because so few people know that stuff and fewer still will teach it he never answered
5088501 with cecil and bill dixon archie shepp and paul bley in one scene they lament the loss of the free and open exchange of ideas that existed before everyone became so star struck by the cash carrot of recording maybe the current economic collapse of the market will shake folks up tell them what is important about this music is not the prospect of a bmw in the driveway the cocaine days of miles are as long gone as birds smack habit and today hypnotic brass get the cool threads from corporate patron sponsorship
5088502 but if you ask about learning the rascher method for top tones they just look at your really funny and change the subject
5088503 the way out is by the door why wont anyone use this method
5088504 i get the feeling there was just too much for the dichotomy to contain
5088505 the truth is that while a lot of critical ink was spilled on both sides of the jazz wars few musicians actually took up arms themselves
5088506 this is one specific interpretation of jazz history there are much broader and deeper things to know but in 15 weeks we can only cover so much

5088508 a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
5088509 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people
5088510 i appeal to the zimbabwean parties to sign any outstanding agreements and conclude the negotiations as a matter of urgency
5088511 there are issues of principle that are quite clearly dear to one of the negotiating parties
5088512 one has no business negotiating if you are not prepared to compromise i hope wise counsel will prevail
5088513 you dont negotiate with your wife or your friend you negotiate with an antagonist an opponent
5088514 theres going to be turmoil then we are really heading for trouble some mad chap might think these fellows have failed now im taking over those are the risks you run
5088515 im not sure that the zimbabweans are not going to start fighting then we are all in trouble theres no option but to agree the consequences are too ghastly to contemplate
5088516 see reason to see failure to agree implies catastrophe for zimbabwe
5088517 over the years the political situation may have been bad the crunch has now come
5088518 the country is melting economically i dont think mr mugabe can fail to see that if he sees that and being the patriot that i believe he is he must have only one answer that the zimbabweans look up to him and the other leaders of the political parties to find a resolution
5088519 they are equals and they ought to be treated as such neither one of them has won the presidential election
5088520 to sit down with mugabe or his ministers we have said no those who break all these rules should not expect to sit at the same table with us before the situation is corrected

5088526 the men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nations greatness but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable especially when that questioning is disinterested for they determine whether we use power or power uses us
5088527 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
5088528 i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually
5088529 hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is but a broken winged bird that cannot fly
5088530 attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference
5088531 dreams are true while they last and do we not live in dreams

5088535 war begins in the minds of men and it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must first be constructed
5088536 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders the country is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body from winter disease and death
5088537 patriotism is to support your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
5088538 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
5088539 the power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it
5088540 democracy is a system ensuring that the people are governed no better than they deserve

5088554 this is an issue that is not on the table and just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5088555 and we have been supportive of the democratic elections that took place in pakistan in fact advocated for them
5088556 president musharraf has been a good ally and everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he kept to his word he took off the uniform
5088557 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror because these terrorists are not just after the us and afghanistan
5088558 theyre also after pakistan as demonstrated by the fact that they killed former pakistan premier benazir bhutto
5088559 obviously some models are good but i think its understandable that what i mean is in finance and economics there has been
5088560 one hesitates to blow things out of proportion but its worth remembering that there are more reasons than just economic efficiency to prioritise
5088561 the difficulty lies in knowing when to abandon one goal and move on to something else

5088576 missione compiuta con un po di sofferenza nel finale ma ci poteva stare ci mancato il gol per chiudere la partita abbiamo avuto due o tre situazioni in cui potevamo chiuderla ma non siamo stati abbastanza cinici sottoporta per ho visto una bella squadra specialmente nel primo tempo bene anche sotto il profilo fisico un po meno sotto quello tecnico specialmente nel finale dove sono saltati un po gli schemi complice il loro forcing per agguantare il pareggio nel complesso la definirei una buona prova la gara di genova per noi sar un grande stimolo per metterci a confronto con squadre pi blasonate di noi impegno importante
5088577 abbiamo risposto bene a questo primo esame ufficiale contro un avversario di grosso livello ci mancato solo il gol per chiuderla abbiamo avuto qualche occasione ma siamo stati un po troppo imprecisi nel complesso per sono soddisfatto siamo sulla buona strada e adesso non ci resta che continuare andremo a genova per farci rispettare

5088579 antonio pu giocare sia prima che seconda punta esterno o dietro due attaccanti rispetto a me comunque pi uomo darea gioca ugualmente bene con tutti e due i piedi rapido e soprattutto ha grandi doti tecniche grazie alle quali riesce a segnare spesso gol spettacolari li vedrete anche qui
5088580 con me a destra e il chino a sinistra nulla proibito spiega poco prima di sbarcare a milano alvaro mi ha detto che la squadra ha potenzialit enormi un grande gruppo e che possiamo essere in grado di affrontare ogni avversaria alla pari io arrivo e devo darmi da fare il campionato italiano si sa una sfida il chino mi ha parlato del presidente moratti che soffre con la squadra e per la squadra la sua fiducia per me una grande spinta non voglio deluderlo
5088581 a me piace il calcio io entro in campo sempre per divertirmi dicono tutti che le mie giocate sono spettacolari e i miei gol sono sorprendenti io delle volte mi sono rivisto e mi sono piaciuto
5088582 meno lucido appare nei giudizi sui giocatori del nostro campionato
5088583 io sono una seconda punta posso giocare anche da trequartista ma soprattutto da seconda punta mi piace muovermi in prossimit dellarea di rigore credo di avere una buona capacit conclusiva ho un tiro preciso piuttosto forte insomma una seconda punta che sa crearsi situazioni pericolose che pu fare assist e pu segnare il piede naturale il destro ma non ho problemi a calciare con entrambi e a muovermi su tutti e due i lati del campo

5088588 question does it frost jackson jesse jackson that someone like obama who fits the stereotype blacks once labeled as an oreo a black on the outside a white on the inside that an oreo should be the beneficiary of the long civil rights struggle which jesse jackson spent his lifetime fighting for
5088589 who knows what jesse jackson is thinking but thats a completely unfair depiction of barack obama
5088590 i want to go back to the point you made about whether or not obama is an oreo because if barack obama is an oreo then every member of this generation of african americans is an oreo because we stand on the shoulders of the people who fought for our rights

5088607 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5088608 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown

5088628 america already has one dr phil we dont need another one when it comes to the economy
5088629 we cant afford to be divided by region or by class or we cant afford to be divided by gender and that means by the way bernie you got to clean up your act this is a family affair

5088631 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
5088632 we may have a recession we havent had one yet
5088633 you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
5088634 while leafing through the book s english language version 1 i came across a quote from a letter written by david ben gurion to his son amos in 1937 stating that we must expel arabs and take their places this rang a distant bell having read the book s hebrew edition several years earlier i recalled the letter as saying something quite different indeed an examination of the hebrew text confirmed my recollection it read as follows we do not wish we do not need to expel arabs and take their place all our aspiration is built on the assumption that there is enough room in the country for ourselves and the arabs though i was surprised by this fundamental contradiction i gave morris the benefit of the doubt perhaps this was merely a mistranslation or even a typographical mistake to set my mind at rest i looked up the entire documentation used by morris with regard to the zionist position regarding the expulsion of the palestinians to the neighbouring arab states or transfer as it is commonly known to which ben gurion s letter allegedly referred to my bewilderment i discovered that there was scarcely a single document quoted by morris which had not been rewritten in a way that distorted its original meaning altogether
5088635 and indeed an examination of the documentation used by several key new historians as well as of sources withheld from their readers led to the disturbing conclusion that morris s distortions were neither a fluke nor an exception rather they typified the modus operandi of a sizeable group of academics journalists and commentators who had predicated their professional careers on rewriting israel s history in an image of their own choosing so as to cast it in the role of the regional villain this is not a matter of contending interpretations or different readings of documents both of which are perfectly legitimate aspects of scholarly research it is a deliberate attempt at historical distortion nothing more nothing less

5088641 like web oriented news consumers integrators are affluent and highly educated however they are older on average than those who consider the internet their main source of news
5088642 the government will continue to have a strict stance against all aspects of corruption and will take legal measures against violators
5088643 there are strict directives to have zero tolerance towards all aspects of corruption bribery and taking advantage of official positions
5088644 ensuring the upholding of the very highest standards of corporate governance and transparency is critical to the long term success of both companies and governments
5088645 the speed and weight of money behind this move has been quite breathtaking
5088646 commodity booms end ugly they always do and there has never been an exception
5088647 this downswing is more consistent with the global economic fundamentals
5088648 the commodity markets are more central to australian national income than either credit markets or share markets
5088649 prices for our commodity exports are still at generational highs and ongoing demand from emerging economies give us some cause for optimism despite slowing global growth
5088650 note that at this time the post has not yet been deleted
5088651 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5088652 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5088653 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5088654 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5088655 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5088656 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5088657 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5088658 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5088659 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5088660 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5088661 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5088662 a man struggles against the relentless march of the modern world around him his cry to release anything and everything that bounds confines or restricts his serenity drives him to insanity and suffocation he hopes to be released from the grip of his present space that limits and immobiliszes his soul and mind

5088678 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5088679 the reason probably i won this title is because i have a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village that was amazing experience for me always was a pleasure to know new people no

5088684 i just wonder why we are here i have no earthly idea other than for political purposes of this governor damnit it is true we all know it but were too afraid to say it
5088685 i am going to sit here and am going to decide whether i am going to vote for anything
5088686 the only thing that could help people is rebates everything else in this call is not necessary and thats where we are i think we should look at what were doing here
5088687 everything we talk about is for show whats really bad is when i stood up i didnt intend to say this
5088688 i think we need to stop and do something very simple what we are doing is almost a fraud on the public

5088703 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5088704 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5088705 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5088706 the point is the party is united were coming together
5088707 ran a great race and the obama team is doing everything we can to bring all her supporters to the fold

5088717 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

5088726 my involvement with the fashion field of sl began last year by chance on one hand and on the other because i couldnt find what i wanted im picky and i follow my daily mood on what to wear in rl and this side of me doesnt change here in sl so when i feel romantic i create a gown when i feel sexy or aggressive or dream i create the right dress that suits my feeling i think every woman has to wear what expresses herself and makes her feel comfortable in any situation from shopping to party from going to work to staying at home but they always need a touch of originality and elegance sl allows me to take out all of my creativity and my fpassion for fashion and i hope my clients can feel that
5088727 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
5088728 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5088729 the biggest thing is nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5088730 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport
5088731 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
5088732 the first thing i thought of doing was to give all the nutritional supplements i have consumed my vitamins for testing

5088735 the russian troops are certainly not in any hurry to leave the country
5088736 the pattern that we see on the ground is unmistakeable
5088737 systematic destruction of our military infrastructure and a seemingly random but no less painful degradation of our civilian infrastructure
5088738 they didnt manage to destroy the country to destroy the government to realise their wishes and dreams

5088743 that was the moment i wouldnt trade it for anything else
5088744 i moved a little bit my foot at the start there was no call back so i went im disappointed i wanted at least one american to get up there
5088745 this is a crazy bolt effect i wanted to come out and do the same thing
5088746 i dont know if i should cry smile jump i think this is a fabulous thing for the three of us to win the medals and for jamaica to get one two three what else can you say
5088747 we made history we are all great athletes and im very excited about the tremendous achievement weve made for our country
5088748 todays victory boosts my confidence to win the 200m we will also do well in the 4x100m i believe we can beat the americans
5088749 definitely we have a strong team we are mentally tough were not going to take this lying down

5088754 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
5088755 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
5088756 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
5088757 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
5088758 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
5088759 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
5088760 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england
5088761 to be honest i wouldnt have even put him on the bench if we had another player to fill up the 15th spot
5088762 he was seeing a few stars when he came off and it wasnt because he got rattled or anything he just cramped up in a game the other night for the olyroos and theyve had a long flight back and six weeks of hard work in 35 degree heat
5088763 so to come here when it was freezing cold and come on it was difficult for him
5088764 but he made a difference for the first 10 15 minutes he was on just in terms of experience
5088765 tony might be back next week but id like him to have a full week at least maybe two of full training
5088766 i dont think hell be right for wellington but i think he might be right after that
5088767 i have to feed all my children by working very hard in the fields and by milking the cows
5088768 we have 22 children and we feed them with milk and chapatis
5088769 when i woke up i was in the middle of a row of bodies awaiting postmortem he said
5088770 my throat was parched and i asked for water towering over me the doctors and nursing staff at anandpur sahib civil hospital looked dazed they must have been surprised to see a dead man come alive like that
5088771 people were dumped quite haphazardly into trucks without checking if they were alive
5088772 we dropped a little bit of ball but so did they
5088773 throughout the year particularly earlier in the year if we had have done that we would have had a try scored against us but tonight it goes to show the difference in attitude between now and then
5088774 it was pretty important before halftime because i thought we were struggling a bit
5088775 halftime was pretty good for us but having said that i still thought the majority of the game we controlled things reasonably well
5088776 i think we have plenty of steam in our outside backs and im sure they would look forward to some dry footy but it doesnt worry us at the moment
5088777 it was a poor game and the skill level was low
5088778 they gave us the opportunity in the first 20 minutes of the second half and we werent good enough to take it
5088779 primero tengo que preguntarte algo te gustan las pelis de gladiadores
5088780 i think its great that the college kids are in town its good for business and plattsburgh state university of new york is a really good place
5088781 ive noticed that the routine or ritual repeats itself year after year as if its scripted
5088782 they know what they have to do have a barbecue park their cars across the sidewalk and i suppose if they knew each other from years previous they know that i have the same script and have to call the cops in
5088783 a lower tolerance is needed i think they need to be fined more readily or maybe the fines should be raised or their parents should be alerted
5088784 but the landlord sees whos going to be living there so in a way it is their responsibility
5088785 its tough my wife and i own a lot of apartments and we rent to a number of students but we screen them and we tell them point blank in the first 30 seconds of the phone conversation we have no tolerance for parties for people coming and going after 10 oclock no loud music and no smoking on the premises and a lot of them just hang up the phone they just cant believe we could be so strict
5088786 friedrich h lderlin hofft dass der neue mensch die reinheit wie das kind haben soll
5088787 id carefully prepared for a difficult duel with stoner which the first laps of the race confirmed
5088788 but i have to say as well that my motorcycle was running perfectly and allowed me to ride very calmly towards victory
5088789 thats why theyre reigning premiers and they have lost only one game this year
5088790 theres no question they are a cut above every team in the competition at the moment by a fair margin
5088791 i think if they play their best theres no one who will beat them
5088792 a little while ago we would have really nerved up and panicked up if we didnt have matthew scarlett playing in the team
5088793 we are more relaxed and people fill a role and cover for him
5088794 in the last quarter i think we probably put our cues in the rack a little bit and didnt really play the best footy but it really didnt matter
5088795 it was all about just getting through to next week really now
5088796 i just know that on any given day we can be beaten
5088797 its more than just skill you need a lot of luck
5088798 but were a good side when we play well i agree with that part
5088799 they are fighting for a top four spot so that will be a very competitive game and we couldnt ask for a better one
5088800 as soon as you take your foot off the pedal the game can really turn around and bite you
5088801 we wont be flirting with our form we wont be trying new things
5088802 wedge politics at its worst and we have to reject it loudly clearly and unequivocally
5088803 its time for the republican senators who are filibustering this measure to put our seniors and our military families ahead of private insurance companies and let the senate pass this bill as soon as possible

5088809 it was an all british final and one of us had to win
5088810 if i hadnt done it today i dont know where i would be
5088811 probably on the floor dead somewhere its been so hard i cant explain i was totally believing in myself but its the ultimate
5088812 i feel like im on my way to court for judgment its decision day and im about to be freed for the rest of my life freed from the demons
5088813 shell sit down and say that it was a fluke that she became world champion a fluke that shes now olympic champion but these things dont happen by fluke
5088814 we go to the ends of the earth to find improvements in performance
5088815 i did a little bit of research on her and then rang her up
5088816 she was at the elite end but then we expected that because she had already won an olympic medal in an endurance sport
5088817 she could put the power down on the bike ive worked with elite female athletes for the last seven years and she is the most driven athlete i have ever met male or female
5088818 we took a massive leap of faith when we took her on board
5088819 we were heading into the unknown and we couldnt let it go wrong
5088820 wed talked about this scenario of both of them reaching the final over the last 18 months or so
5088821 they are really professional theyve been world champions together and now theyre olympic medalists it was business as usual theyre team mates and they could be going to london 2012
5088822 im not spending four years pandering to individuals needs because this is sport it isnt about personal differences one person wins and one person loses they both accept that and they both know that they wouldnt be where they are without each other

5088827 last time you came here you mentioned a dream where you were flying you said it was like one of the old planes they used to use yes jimmy
5088828 i do remember the plane doctor i remember being the plane flying high in the air the ground was moving around like one of this pinball mazes all topsy turvy like can you call me jim instead of jimmy doctor
5088829 of course jim what did the ground look like was it somewhere you recognise
5088830 it was green lots of trees around short trees with bushy branches and a little river running below
5088831 how did it feel being the plane compared to being jim
5088832 i dont know its just a strange memory i guess it must have felt really good
5088833 you said before jim that it scared you like you were falling
5088834 it did at first but when i didnt fall and it happened more often i started to feel safer
5088835 good jim im glad you know you are safe when you sleep and do you feel it represents boredom in you some longing for adventure and escape portraying itself as some kind of fantasy perhaps we all have fantasies jim i wanted to fly the space shuttle when i was your age
5088836 of course jim of course i forget sometimes youre a bright lad but ill get to the root that out soon enough
5088837 lets finish up for now jim well pick up again next week

5088859 the united states has become a de facto one party state with the legislative branch permanently controlled by an incumbents party and every president exploiting his role as commander in chief to expand on the imperial prerogatives of his office
5088860 being an iit director is a full time job the fact that at least iit rajasthan which iit k is to mentor and of which i hold additional charge as director is on the iit k campus is a big help we were only told in may that iit rajasthan would have to be started this academic session from our campus which means in this short time we had to arrange accommodation as well as faculty for them and with the immense cooperation of our administrative and academic staff we have managed reasonably well the faculty has been very helpful and we have the best of teachers for iit rajasthan students
5088861 we are sharing iit kanpur laboratories and various other facilities with iit rajasthan
5088862 iit k students from the popular gymkhana have volunteered to open it to iit rajasthan students we have also got them separate playgrounds
5088863 iit rajasthan must have its own identity which is unique by itself so even as they are sharing our campus they have a separate building where their classes are held they have a dedicated building called iit rajasthan where the computer centre library administrative office and directors office is housed they also have a separate logo with the backdrop of jaipurs jantar mantar there are four dedicated committers looking at their issues
5088864 the facilities faculty infrastructure is really good and its been a great experience so far
5088865 we hear the site of iit rajasthan is yet to be decided upon i am not sure if wed like to switch over to a completely new establishment with fresh faculty after the iit kanpur experience

5088872 the looming rate cut by the reserve bank will no doubt give companies greater optimism as they progress through 2009 mr james said in a note
5088873 the lower australian dollar and decline in fuel costs will arguably provide more benefits
5088874 the petroleum group has the best chance of bringing home some big numbers this year following record high oil prices wiseowl com senior equities analyst simon guzowski said
5088875 the other major commodity earner for them is copper and while prices have fallen away in the last few weeks to a six month low up to june 30 prices were not far off record highs so that has to be a positive for bhps earnings he said
5088876 if bhp is able to demonstrate stronger growth in its production numbers than rio it would look to use these to try to convince asian buyers and european regulators that commodity supply is more likely to rise under a merged group he said
5088877 a number of miners have been hit quite hard by rising fuel processing machinery and labour costs mr guzowski said
5088878 were expecting a great result but because youve had so much change over the last month particularly in these commodity prices coming off the market will be more focused on those issues going forward stock resource managing director stephen bartrop said
5088879 the fact that the oil price is coming off its highs is a negative in the sense that the increase in earnings momentum for bhp is going to be diminished
5088880 we will be profitable again in 2009 mr kurer said in an interview with swiss sunday newspaper
5088881 one must first remove the fallen trees then tidy up the house and cellar and in the third phase bring the shine back to the house he said adding that he believes the bank to be now in the second phase
5088882 its already been examined by the accc australian competition and consumer commission but i have to take advice from apra australian prudential regulation authority and i have to take into account national interest considerations he told abc television
5088883 i accept that i have a decision to take because its market sensitive i dont speculate about the outcome of that decision mr swan said
5088884 but we have our eye on financial stability in the system as well as the competitive nature of the system when i take that decision about national interest considerations
5088885 four pillars no mergers between the commonwealth bank national australia bank westpac and anz policy mr swan said
5088886 we did that because of concerns about financial stability in the system not just in terms of competition
5088887 we expect the bhp results followed by rio tintos a week later will show two sets of strong numbers with little to choose between them operationally said michael rawlinson an analyst at britains liberum capital
5088888 i have enjoyed my time with the wallabies immensely and there is still much to be done over the next few months
5088889 looking further ahead what this opportunity with the waratahs provides is an appealing opportunity to be at home more frequently

5088891 the travel demands over the past three seasons have been extensive
5088892 michaels been working hard with our forwards for some time now and weve seen the results in the waratahs set piece play and scrummaging in particular
5088893 it was good to get up in what was a bit of a pressure game fairly physical it was a good hit out
5088894 they challenged us in the forwards in particular so its pleasing to get that many points against them

5088946 i think he is a very important player for the club you can see spurs without berbatov are a different team without keane as well they are a different team
5088947 they are huge players it will be very difficult to replace berbatov he is a class player he is not affected by anything around him

5088958 all of us stepped into this journey with great faith and great belief that humanity would carry us through from town to town and thats exactly what happened
5088959 for me to walk from leeds to london is probably the single most difficult thing i could ever have imagined
5088960 i still cant quite believe that i have achieved it but i never gave up because of the people that never gave up on me
5088961 weve come on a small journey in the scale of things but a large journey for us of hope of optimism of reconciliation
5088962 the journey to build a better and fairer and more equitable society is a journey we must all continue on relentlessly and continue on together

5088967 the worst moral failure of our nation is our repeated attempts to define away the rights of individuals whether it is with slaves or segregation or in my opinion abortion or even today in terms of property rights we dont come out and say we are taking away rights we simply deny that you have any rights so that we no longer have any problem taking from you what is rightfully yours
5088968 to have your number retired its one of the greatest things that could ever happen to you
5088969 i knew the significance of it so i was nervous i havent been this nervous in a long time
5088970 i played the game i dearly loved to play since i was a kid
5088971 they gave me a number and now its hanging from the rafters

5088980 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5088981 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5088982 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5088983 he has the nerve to stand up there on television and talk about how he believes in alternative energy
5088984 we have a lot of sun here in nevada and we can use that to generate energy and free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil
5088985 here in nevada we should have solar panels all throughout the state everywhere
5088986 when john mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here and drill there which is something he just came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling because he had been opposed to it before then hes not telling the truth about what its going to take to actually free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil and start bringing oil prices down
5088987 he said a while back that the reason for high energy prices is we havent been doing anything in washington for the last 30 years john mccain is actually right the only thing he didnt mention was he was there for 25 of them
5088988 the senator obama is playing politics with our energy policy
5088989 i think sen obama is consistently the dr no of energy he has said no to nuclear energy and no to drilling
5088990 the big picture is sen mccain is the only one with a bipartisan record the time for partisan gridlock is over
5088991 the first thing id like to do to my mum is just hug her said phelps whose parents separated when he was young
5088992 ive literally seen her for about 30 seconds this whole time
5088993 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5088994 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5088995 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
5088996 there are restrictions on the circulation of information very strong censorship
5088997 civilians are often arrested violently tortured to the point where they die its really very very sad
5088998 it hasnt reached the point that its barred us from travelling we will still travel like we used to and maintain the same lifestyle
5088999 public sector workers dont understand why the government is not raising wages to match inflation there is a disconnection between expectations and what the government delivers and so there is discontent
5089000 i dont feel it has affected me too much because my familys financial situation is good
5089001 but ive noticed we dont buy as many things as we used to like laptops in every home each person has to buy at least one a year thats the usual demand but not for us this year
5089002 this is the second time i have done it and i have used the money to chip in with six other women to start a catering business
5089003 i have also taken to sewing clothes some to sell and some to dress my children with and it has helped me a lot but things are still difficult for my husband and me
5089004 saudi arabia is about to enter an era where there is no middle class you will either find extremely rich people or extremely poor people unfortunately
5089005 the saudi people now know the extent of graft at the administration and the squandering of the budget
5089006 nobody knows how much the government takes in from oil
5089007 we know how much is in the budget but not how much state oil firm aramco got in the first place the budget figure is a cheque aramco gave to the government
5089008 you can make some calculations there is a 20 22 percent difference
5089009 we are passing through a very critical stage you are talking about a state with more than a billion dollars every 24 hours they can buy anyone
5089010 saudi arabia is still considered a country where you can make larger savings than in the uae united arab emirates or qatar despite rising inflationary pressures
5089011 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5089012 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
5089013 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
5089014 traditionally the pharmaceutical industry will admit that they actually charged what they think the market will bear the wiser ones are recognising that that model is no longer available

5089022 the whole peninsula is going to be under a threat for tornadoes and flooding
5089023 although some weakening is likely as fay crosses cuba fay is expected to be near hurricane strength as it approaches the florida keys
5089024 we need to make sure we have food water and have a hurricane plan
5089025 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
5089026 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you

5089029 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
5089030 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5089031 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5089032 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5089033 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5089034 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5089035 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5089036 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5089037 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5089038 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5089039 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5089040 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5089041 when i stepped back i could see the smoke seeping out of the attic and looking down to the basement there was also smoke seeping out of the gasps
5089042 ive never seen it ive never heard of it i mean weve had lightning strikes before but to follow a specific line like that is unusual
5089043 we went around the front of the house and we could hear an alarm
5089044 we will meet with the representatives of chevron texaco who are asking for a meeting but with our colleagues of the amazon defence front the plaintiffs lawyers present
5089045 be confident that you have a patriotic and sovereign government that will never again bow to the interests of the big transnational companies
5089046 our position hasnt changed we are open to a meeting that could provide a solution
5089047 but if we sit down the government needs to discuss its unfulfilled contractual obligations
5089048 we are committed to a resolution that includes a comprehensive remediation of the environmental harm caused by texaco and for that to happen the ecuadorean court needs to be allowed to finish the case
5089049 we wanted to win a medal in every relay and we achieved that we wanted to score the most medals that weve ever scored before and we achieved that
5089050 we also probably wanted to score the most gold medals of anybody but we didnt quite get there we were one short of athens and two short of melbourne but one more than sydney
5089051 we go home with a lot of our goals achieved but still room to improve and still places to go
5089052 i think we underestimated the emotional cost the highs have on people
5089053 beijing is definitely happening right now and the momentum of the olympics has given an amazing boost to the city
5089054 i am the first big chef from the outside coming to beijing the front warrior who will have to figure out the suppliers the best ingredients and train staff it takes time to do that but im happier being first in beijing than the last in china
5089055 i dont think as a french chef i should try to turn chinese tomorrow just to make everybody happy asian people are well aware of what good dining is now
5089056 strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days and fay could be approaching hurricane strength as it nears western cuba
5089057 residents living in low lying areas are also likely to be mandated to seek safe shelter at this time officials are not likely to order a general resident evacuation
5089058 my instinct would be for john terry because he is the type of naturally courageous player who leads his team mates by example
5089059 but rio ferdinand so much more mature than five years ago would be a clever choice for another reason you feel terry will give 100 per cent whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances but ferdinand might find an extra ten per cent in his game by being captain
5089060 ive noticed with ferdinand the bigger the stage the better he plays he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games by giving ferdinand the responsibility of leading his country out you almost guarantee world class performances from him
5089061 i still remember the negative 5 3 2 that cost us last time we went to croatia this time lets not be intimidated by the opposition and play two strikers
5089062 this year has been one of the hardest years of my life as well as one of the greatest years of my life
5089063 i ll probably take a deep breath and it will all hit me i m still on an emotional high
5089064 pozdnyakov is one of the greatest fencers of all time
5089065 i was really fortunate today to stick with the game plan that we developed nobody expected us to but we showed that we can work and do really well
5089066 vi har ved flere anledninger tatt til orde for kasinodrift i norge det er en bedre m te regulere spill p
5089067 nei vi nsker ikke at staten skal v re med og drive kasinoene
5089068 det kan f re til mer penhet og at dem som lider av spilleavhengighet vil oppleve at det er lettere f hjelp det er vanskelig hjelpe n r folk sitter p nettet og spiller p utenlandske sider
5089069 jeg syns det er meningsl st snakke om at det blir lettere forebygge spillavhengighet hvis vi pner for privat kasinodrift folk som tjener penger p andres avhengighet vil ikke v re s interessert i passe p folk
5089070 vi ser ingen grunn til pne for kasinospill i norge og jeg tror ikke det vil f re til mindre spilleavhengighet man har uansett ingen garanti for at de som spiller nettpoker vil g over til kasinospilling isteden tvert imot vil det nok komme i tillegg

5089093 back then the croats took an incredibly brutal action and killed many civilians but the west pretended they did not see it
5089094 but we all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the lord are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory just as from the lord the spirit
5089095 for god who said light shall shine out of darkness is the one who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of christ

5089101 he shared the same assertiveness courage and perserverance and their belief that they deserved a place in australian society

5089126 legally you are not supposed to possess fake currency notes otherwise you will need to explain from where you got them if you cant you may be detained for questioning
5089127 i went to a shop and bought clothes and when i was making the payment the cashier told me that four notes of rs 500 denomination were fake
5089128 the cops allowed me to go only after i explained the entire situation to them and presented the atm receipt from where i had withdrawn the money but that was not enough i was poorer by rs 2 000
5089129 the government should also encourage fair and fearless reporting of fake currency cases in normal circumstances a person reporting the matter becomes the primary suspect this leads to a tendency wherein people prefer to suffer a loss than face the hassle involved in registering a case and then going to court

5089146 surely it is those who opposed every step of this emancipation rather than those who advocated it who should be asked to explain and justify themselves
5089147 there are things those contending the statement could say he must know that i mean honest things reasonable things but so many of those who opposed the iraq war have given voice and for so much of the time to the denial that there could have been any good reasons on the other side that his drawing attention to good news is very much to the point
5089148 hitchens must know that there are honest and reasonable responses
5089149 friends it is vital to the future of peace in the region that we support the iraqi trade unions while glossing over their continued opposition to the american occupation we must continue to show solidarity with their cause until cough cough mumble at which point the iraqi people will finally defeat islamist obscurantism and tyranny
5089150 indeed i say to you that now is also the time to stand up to the tyrants of the chinese communist party
5089151 and not only that but all nations must boycott the forthcoming beijing olympic games thus forcing the chinese authorities to cough mumble cough a free tibet and a democratic china hallelujah brothers and sisters

5089160 this is the transparent fei i have been elected to deliver
5089161 and you the media should get used to such information coming from us safety cannot be mixed with politics
5089162 and i now beg you to concentrate on what really matters in these games the athletes and their wonderful performances
5089163 the incidence of fatalities and severe injuries incurred while riding cross country has attracted international media attention eventing was under strong threat of exclusion from the olympic games before safety became a recognized issue
5089164 and of course there is the very human element of requiring so far as practicable that every competitor not only experiences a good and safe competition but returns fit and well with the equine athletes in like condition after experiencing a satisfying competition presented without any unnecessary peril
5089165 this is invariable procedure and the tds and gj expect to receive comments and requests from chefs and athletes and to decide whether to make alterations four or five alterations were made on this basis to the course after it was opened
5089166 we do have an offer in on a property down the road from the church we have not heard we want to stay within three miles of the church and any help in that direction would be appreciated

5089168 the church building is not the church you know we are the church if this building fell down tomorrow wed just meet someplace else and still be the church

5089170 tibet tibet ha ha no answer for that eh stopper you all saw that he doesnt care about the suffering of the tibetan people but hes obsessed with israel suspicious the way he singles out the jews eh why dont you take your racist hatred somewhere else you disgusting bigot
5089171 given the horrific slaughter that has resulted from the invasion of iraq it would seem that it was unwise to trust the republicans and that the doctrine of liberal intervention must be subjected to a thoroughgoing and rigorous audit process to determine why it failed
5089172 you anti imperialist lefties disgust me with your blatant cold hearted disregard for the lives of alternative iraqis however horribly the fascists ba athists and jihadists have disfigured iraq there can be no doubt that it is better than what would have happened if we had not intervened
5089173 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

5089182 among the joyous heartless ever juvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous god omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs he saw gods foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad
5089183 our first priority is to reclaim the putrid corpse of the left from the besplattered sewer of relativist anti americanism hose it down in the carwash of democratic liberalism then dress it up in the charity shop suit of anti fascist righteousness
5089184 an excellent proposal comrade so when do we bomb tehran then
5089185 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5089186 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5089187 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5089188 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5089189 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5089190 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5089191 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5089192 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5089193 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was

5089196 as a commodity exporting nation australia is highly dependent on both the outlook for global growth and commodity prices
5089197 the data gave the us dollar some support but i think people are starting to worry that maybe we will see a little bit of a breather in the us dollar rally
5089198 there have been a mixed bag of factors going on affecting the australian dollar but i do think it is really in a consolidation phase and it will wait for the rba minutes for direction
5089199 the government will continue to have a strict stance against all aspects of corruption and will take legal measures against violators
5089200 there are strict directives to have zero tolerance towards all aspects of corruption bribery and taking advantage of official positions
5089201 ensuring the upholding of the very highest standards of corporate governance and transparency is critical to the long term success of both companies and governments
5089202 the speed and weight of money behind this move has been quite breathtaking
5089203 commodity booms end ugly they always do and there has never been an exception
5089204 this downswing is more consistent with the global economic fundamentals
5089205 the commodity markets are more central to australian national income than either credit markets or share markets
5089206 prices for our commodity exports are still at generational highs and ongoing demand from emerging economies give us some cause for optimism despite slowing global growth

5089213 land o lakes located a half hour west of tampa
5089214 it is traditional to name new boats and since these are the newest boats the area has seen in such a long time it seems fitting that local residents are given the chance to help mark the celebration
5089215 hopefully the boats will be used for a long time to come and they will surely become part of the history of the lake
5089216 this is a great opportunity for residents to leave their mark on this much loved landmark
5089217 whats happening is the taxpayers are under assault like weve never seen before

5089222 what about the psychology of drinking flavored water compared to actual water
5089223 p s milk is not the best thing for kids to drink it is water plain and simple kids are far too fat already
5089224 one hundred percent fruit juice or reconstituted juice can be a healthy part of the diet when consumed as part of a well balanced diet a variety of fruit juices provided in appropriate amounts for a childs age are not likely to cause any significant clinical symptoms

5089236 of limits on late term abortions if there is an exception for the mothers health
5089237 reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions
5089238 we dont know for sure when life begins so we should opt for death
5089239 well i dont know what the ontological status of the thing my little johnny is talking about is so i should allow him to make his own decision

5089243 the essentials of good writing can be learned you can teach people how to edit how to structure an argument how to use evidence to prove a point
5089244 you can train the eye and the ear to recognize cliche you can push students to clarify sloppy thinking you can show them how to write with strong vivid nouns and verbs in teaching nonfiction you can explain how to build an argument so that it persuades the reader you can show students how to illustrate an article or a legal brief with a single telling detail
5089245 you can open people s eyes to the essentials of great writing but you can t give people a gift you can t teach genius
5089246 create sympathetic characters and put them in jeopardy thats advice crimewriter leonard tourney gave me and its stuck also grow a thick skin learn how to take criticism and grow from it
5089247 if my books arent entertaining im not doing my job
5089248 as someone with a share of fiction workshops sticking out of my side pocket i can say that i learned more about writing when it was my turn to offer critique of other writers in my group
5089249 i just finished a scriptwriting workshop and the big advice from the teacher was to say steal often
5089250 i think self knowledge is one of the beautiful and marvelous creative aids that we have know thy self
5089251 because you can look at yourself in the mirror and get a whole list of all the human attributes and human frailties that are extent whatever is wrong with you is conceivably wrong with most of your peers
5089252 whatever is decent and good and fine and caring that is a part of your nature is also the meritorious aspects of your peers
5089253 just a piece of dialogue would i say it and if i heard it would i believe it
5089254 common tools on the top shelf vocabulary and grammar elements of grammar and style on the second level along with an understanding of the paragraph as the basic element in fiction

5089258 id will come up with something at some point just you wait
5089259 can you or they provide any samples of things that intelligent design theory has predicted which researchers have later determined to be true
5089260 some unknown being with unknown capabilities and unknowable motives did something of no interest that makes the universe different than it would have been otherwise
5089261 in the future we will prove that we are right and evolution is wrong
5089262 biologists will never manage to get a bacterium to evolve a flagellum in the laboratory
5089263 if dogs are intelligently designed they will usually have four legs
5089264 no transitional fossils will usually be discovered because the proposed series never existed
5089265 no transitional fossils will usually be discovered because fossilisation is a rare and difficult process
5089266 the researchers will focus on discovering the mechanisms that drive sudden bursts of creativity
5089267 another challenge to evolution is the natural occurrence of isolated groups of the same species of aquatic freshwater organisms e g fish and aquatic plants in different lakes rivers and streams that apparently were never connected to each other
5089268 another challenge to evolution is the natural occurrence of isolated groups of the same species of aquatic freshwater organisms e g fish and aquatic plants in different lakes rivers and streams that apparently were never connected to each other
5089269 we will learn more about the real nature of our universe and our place in it and how best we can explore it when we accept the fact that it didnt just happen
5089270 but i thought that was what id was all about instead of just so stories id provides just happened stories
5089271 as for my predictions i am simply waiting to see if they pan out i only argue about such things with publishers
5089272 i see something with an e edward elvis oh its getting clearer evinrude teeny weeny evinrudes
5089273 no account of human evolution will show a long slow emergence from unconsciousness to semi consciousness to consciousness
5089274 creation scientists state that evolutionists have had over 140 years to find a transitional fossil and nothing approaching a conclusive transitional form has ever been found and that only a handful of highly doubtful examples of transitional fossils exist
5089275 ok so maybe it happened in those cases but youve got to find a lot more to demonstrate that it is likely
5089276 there may be transitional fossils or there may not and we have no way of saying which will be missing and which will not
5089277 bruce here is in charge of hegelian philosophy and bruce here is in charge of the sheep dip
5089278 fish as vectors in the dispersal of bythotrephes cederstroemi diapausing eggs survive passage through the gut
5089279 the core question concerns the legitimacy of id vs the legitimacy of evolutionary biology
5089280 i think there are some particular characteristics of naturalism that deserve reconsideration
5089281 science and philosophy cannot be separated we have the same situation in theology the construct that we know as the scientific method is first a philosophical method based on a set of presuppositions about the observable world around us
5089282 but dont classic and neo darwinian systematics require origins in a purely material universe dont they require spontaneous generation of life your caveat seems to be your surrender
5089283 we know that not everything in science is subject to the method much of quantum physics and cosmology are based upon mathematical computation and the parts computed to exist are never observed verificationism in science left two decades or so ago but apparently not enough recognize the situation
5089284 cosmologists like carl sagan and physical scientists like newton generally mixed science and philosophy its just a part of history
5089285 the problem with dembskis book im surprised how few have actually read it is that he mixed two elements which should have been kept separate dembskis material on information was a useful criticism of the presumed randomness required by the naturalist his injection of the cause should have been a separate piece
5089286 natural occurrence of isolated groups of the same species of aquatic freshwater organisms e g fish and aquatic plants in different lakes rivers and streams that apparently were never connected to each other
5089287 this thread is about the empirical predictions that id does or does not make and thats not about legitimacy of course it is
5089288 if we evolved from monkeys then why arent the missing links here today
5089289 natural occurrence of isolated groups of the same species of aquatic freshwater organisms e g fish and aquatic plants in different lakes rivers and streams that apparently were never connected to each other
5089290 who here has seen a quantum element nobody effects have been observed through experimentation that was preceded by calculation but not by visual inspection you can cling to verificationism all your might but its just not there
5089291 only the creationists conflate the two for the purpose of sowing confusion
5089292 the point was that dependence upon the scientific method must be tempered
5089293 you are full of crap and you know it fatheaded ed brayton is very intolerant of commenters who disagree with him you know that right now he is arbitrarily censoring my comments over there and you are applauding him for doing it
5089294 do you even bother to consult a basic biology text or even spend a couple of minutes with wikipedia before making these ridiculous assertions
5089295 ok maybe its getting warmer but its not our fault
5089296 some communities have their own resident trolls theyre accpeted within the general fold of the blog topic but act with the same irrationality as xyz your fallacious post is a prime example
5089297 as an example on an earlier thread on this blog i and others engaged in a rather pointless discussion with a young earth creationist calling himself jons whose views on purely scientific issues rested entirely on his strict fundamentalist interpretation of the hebrew and christian bibles
5089298 im always kicking their butts thats why they dont like me
5089299 i think im going to leave this comment from larry up
5089300 the widely understood definition of a private military contractor is a company that provides services typically provided by the government or the military we stand by our description of sovereign deed as a private military contractor because it proposes to provide services akin to what the government military or national guard would typically provide in a disaster response
5089301 considering the extent to which larry fafarman has been persecuted how would that be irrational
5089302 slc you are just a big bag of fart gas
5089303 in this co evolution of absolute co dependence it is very likely that there is nothing to adapt to because the necessary co dependent trait s in the other organism is extremely likely to be locally absent
5089304 things should be as simple as possible but no simpler
5089305 if coevolution had to work the way that nobody thinks it works then it wouldnt work
5089306 fatal or harmful in absence of some corresponding co dependent trait
5089307 if coevolution had to work in a way that nobody believes it does then it wouldnt work
5089308 you are entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts

5089319 23 geworden oder so und da gratulieren wir alle mal ganz dolle
5089320 when i saw the truck i thought it was for 10 families i couldnt believe it was all for us
5089321 this ministry has been the phoenix in my own personal life
5089322 through all those 18 surgeries and the years that went by getting through them my constant prayer was god just show me what i can do in the physical condition im in to serve you and help people
5089323 for two months i had this conversation with god i said excuse me but this isnt a safe neighborhood cant you send a big male christian down the street instead of me i kept bringing that to gods attention by his grace he ignored me
5089324 our parents couldnt help us and they were really happy that we were in a country where people help when there is a need
5089325 its a great way for middle and upper class people to recycle furniture we are able to give them a tax write off
5089326 we believe its really gods grace in their life that delivered them from sleeping on the floor we want to give credit to our ceo jesus we dont want to appear like were just a nice group of people we are but thats not what motivates us to do this
5089327 it makes them feel like theyre normal it makes them feel they have a home and that theyre not just squatting someplace theres no longer that feeling that were going to move someplace else next month
5089328 it was like christmas they were bouncing up and down the neighbors came over to see and helped unload the mattress
5089329 i was crying when those beds came it was a real blessing
5089330 i know that many of you will have doubts citing the mistakes we made in iraq and afghanistan and yes sadly mistakes were made my plea is that you dont let your opinion of the trillion dollar bloodbath we accidentally kick started in vietraq prevent you from supporting movements for democracy by which i mean saying yes boss and throwing our weight behind whatever hare brained scheme were told to support next so we must resist the argument of the left and right to retreat into a world of realpolitik and yadda yadda yadda you get the idea bombs away freedom and democracy etcetera thank you for your time enjoy the finger buffet all major credit cards accepted

5089355 these couples are mainly from poor communities and could not afford the big costs of a normal wedding
5089356 people and news media tend to focus on what is considered to be controversial rather than focus on the issues that are relevant to a lot of the countries in the region
5089357 a singular focus is not good for anybody and certainly not good for the people that we are trying to be responsible for
5089358 as a commodity exporting nation australia is highly dependent on both the outlook for global growth and commodity prices
5089359 the data gave the us dollar some support but i think people are starting to worry that maybe we will see a little bit of a breather in the us dollar rally
5089360 there have been a mixed bag of factors going on affecting the australian dollar but i do think it is really in a consolidation phase and it will wait for the rba minutes for direction
5089361 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont he told abc tv
5089362 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
5089363 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
5089364 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
5089365 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
5089366 jumped the gun in supporting moves to introduce fuelwatch to south australia four years ago
5089367 but then i set up a parliamentary inquiry he told channel 9
5089368 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
5089369 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through
5089370 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit and issues have to be taken on their merits
5089371 i cant in good conscience support a law that i just dont agree with

5089374 after the initial terrorist attacks we had no choice other than to use minimum force to counter the threat
5089375 pardon me general but it says here you bombed the airport the petrol stations the factories the highways the supermarkets shops bakeries sea ports in fact you appear to have bombed practically everything except for the terrorists themselves
5089376 exactly it was an appalling act of terrorism by proxy for which the terrorists bear ultimate responsibility
5089377 i see that there have been extensive blackouts in tehran today with some speculating that the elderly power grid cannot maintain supply to all parts of the city due to a lack of maintenance some are asking whether external actors may have played a part take it from the top boys
5089378 ha ha no it was the joooooooos using their mystical powers ha ha ha ha omfg 1 1
5089379 no no ive got it now it was an eight foot tall uberrace of neokkkon space lizards who zapped tehrans electricity networks with gamma rays and lazer beams from an orbital network of hebraic satellite lazers
5089380 honestly those poor iraqis who died today this just confirms that we were absolutely right to agitate for the liberation of iraq and i stand side by side its people in their struggle against fascism
5089381 im sure theyre thankful to have you standing alongside them too
5089382 honestly thats just despicable i never thought id see you sneer at the poor benighted victims of violence
5089383 there is currently no indication that the situation at the former ispat site represents any risk to the health of naval service personnel or civilian employees at the naval base
5089384 high risks to humans groundwater surface water marine ecosystem from leached metals hydrocarbons and pcbs
5089385 high risk to humans from pcbs spills high risk to marine ecosystem from metals from dust high moderate risks to humans from windblown dust
5089386 likely the tip is unvegetated dusts present on the tip may be mobilised and blown by the wind
5089387 harm is likely to arise to a designated receptor i e human from an identified hazard at the site without appropriate remedial action
5089388 deposited on the east tip until 1980 as a dust
5089389 this material comprises a fine dust which will require some form of treatment to facilitate handling and disposal or recycling on or off site
5089390 all of the results were obtained during a period of inactivity at both the east tip and the steel works
5089391 any breach of the 50 g m daily limit value may be considered significant
5089392 the most obvious source of pm10 particles is the material located to the east of the sampling location on the east tip during an easterly wind there is a significant probability of increased particulate levels impacting on the basin area
5089393 the exceedences correspond to a high number of recorded easterly wind hours during that time and significant machinery activity on the east tip after this period activity on the east tip reduced
5089394 the level of activity at the east tip and the steel works during the sampling period was generally low apart from a period of machinery movement and scrap steel recovery on the east tip during the early phase of the sampling period the results obtained from the selected parameters reflect this low level of activity therefore the levels recorded for each of the parameters would be considered baseline levels
5089395 based on these results and comparison to the appropriate standards there is no significant impact on ambient air quality in the basin and headquarters area of the island arising from the steel works and the east tip
5089396 however should the level of activity in these areas change due to removal of material on the east tip or structural alteration remediation of the steel works area it is probable that ambient air quality in the area will suffer a significant impact particularly with regard to pm10 levels this would be based on the impact of machinery movement on the recorded pm10 levels during the early phase of the sampling period
5089397 pm10 is defined as particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 m this description is restricted to this physical characteristic and no particular chemical composition is implied the size is of importance because it is this that determines where in the human respiratory tract a particle deposits when inhaled most concern is given to particles small enough to penetrate into the lungs to reach the alveoli when inhaled almost all particles larger than 7 m are deposited in the nose and throat and only 20 30 of particles between 1 and 7 m are deposited in the alveoli the measurement of pm10 relies on the use of a size selective instrument which collects small particles preferentially
5089398 details the results of monitoring over the period 01 04 08 01 05 08 i
5089399 the dustfall levels at one of the three measured locations for the april 2008 period exceeded the ta luft annual limit of 350 mg m day reaching 362 of the limit at the naval base church on haulbowline island the monthly deposition level at the naval base dockyard and at cobh reached 33 and 13 of the ta luft limit vales respectively
5089400 all of the reports highlighted the potential risks to humans and the environment from materials dumped and spilled on site this included potential heavy metal contamination leached from waste slag and furnace dust waste oils organic solvents pcbs pahs and radioactive material historical site activities may have disposed sludges containing high levels of metals and mill scale on site
5089401 according to the ktc report 1995 the east tip is predominantly comprised of slag approximately 45 000 tonnes year with laboratory chemicals hot flume dust oil and grease and domestic waste prior to the 1980 s the fine filter dust was deposited with the slag without being processed but was palletised and exported from the early 1980s in 1994 a part of the east tip was reclaimed for the development of a naval football pitch
5089402 the materials dumped on the east tip are a significant potential source of heavy metal contamination of sediment and groundwater as demonstrated by the laboratory analyses
5089403 observations at the site suggest that the uncompacted waste near the ground surface has a high permeability the permeability of the waste is expected to be highly variable due to the following factors the nature of the deposited materials varied from fine dust or sludge to coarse metal fragments the shallow waste was much less compacted than the deeper waste and the waste below the water table was flushed by the tide which may have allowed some dissolving and washing of the finer particles
5089404 hazardous waste was disposed of at three separate locations the former dock and waterway the south tip and the east tip that there is documentary evidence to confirm or strongly suggest disposal of furnace dust waste oils organic solvents and pcbs at the south and east tips that there is a possibility that similar wastes were disposed at the dock and waterway process wastewater treatment sludge containing high levels of metals may have been deposited on site a coal gasification plant was demolished ca 1960 such plants are recognized as sources of pahs and can be a significant contaminant there is a strong possibility that the contaminated demolition debris from the gasification plant has been disposed of on the site the furnace dust assessment established that it readily leaches lead and zinc and in sufficient quantities is toxic to marine organisms the east tip was used for disposal of production wastes the primary contaminants identified were heavy metals oils and pcbs however the investigation by ocm did not assess all potential contaminants and there was no investigation on the south tip
5089405 contaminated demolition debris from the former coal gasification plant and possibly the galvanizing plant may have been used as fill no site investigation data for the main plant is available to confirm the nature of the fill material
5089406 t here is currently no indication that the situation at the former ispat site represents any risk to the health of naval service personnel or civilian employees at the naval base
5089407 the government knows that it has to grasp the nettle and make tough decisions but whether thatll be one of them i doubt it
5089408 the third level colleges have been banging on about the need for the reintroduction of fees so you tell them that youre going to sort that out but all along the real goal is to get consultants in to do an audit
5089409 make sure that the senior people in our universities who are the most professional have the greatest experience and who can make a valuable contribution to the students are actually in the classroom from time to time
5089410 a form of student contribution which would be applied only to those who can absolutely afford to pay it is one possibility that merits debate
5089411 if we would have preemptively worked with russia with georgia making sure that nato had the kind of ability and the presence and the engagement we could have perhaps avoided this
5089412 what weve done is focused so much on iraq that a lot of these other issues have slipped theyve not had the priority they deserve theyve not had the kind of attention that an obama administration would provide
5089413 theyve got to show that they can be responsible citizens again

5089437 how ridiculous i object to your obsessive singling out of israel why should this one tiny state be held to higher standards than everybody else
5089438 turning to our next case lets see ah that bloody information commissioner what thomas isnt it still banging on about that iraq nonsense i see oh well i suppose we might as well just bash through it make it look good
5089439 indeed i see a further difficulty here this transparency and accountability malarkey sets a jolly bad precedent if we start auditing government decision making thatll hardly encourage them to be more open about their true intentions in future will it
5089440 i object your honour i inaudible in the interests of full public disclosure inaudible
5089441 yes thats all well and good thomas but what if ministers were unable to get their story straight in private before presenting a pack of half truths exaggerations and outright lies to the public if johnny taxpayer is going to stick his oafish nose into every cabinet meeting it carries a real risk that ministers will be less open and transparent when preparing to mislead the public over future foreign policy disasters
5089442 overruled thomas you contemptible little scrote whats all this about pre emptive war then surely thats the whole point you clot one goes to the great trouble of shooting first precisely so that one can ask questions later or preferably never im satisfied that t his will all come out in the fullness of time by which point everyone will have forgotten what the problem was and therell be no unpleasant prosecutions case dismissed
5089443 now you thomas information commissioner or not im of good mind to fine you for wasting the courts time this morning you meddlesome little turd whats your interest in overturning the basics of british governance eh for let us not forget that liberty if it means anything is the right to elect a prime minister then slavishly obey his whims without getting ideas above our station eh
5089444 get out of my sight you despicable oaf now whats next what lunchtime already good show im ruddy starving and ive got the common man vs the liberal intelligentsia to do first thing tomorrow morning
5089445 why are you so determined to extend saddams reign of terror 600 000 rwandans died because people like you did nothing
5089446 hey did you hear that some guy with a website has run those reuters photos through his algorithmic transmogriphicationaliser and it turns out it was all the palestinians fault
5089447 wow i always thought that looked suspicious hey look some guy with a website says that the americans are trying to flog the iraqis natural resources to their business associates at super bonanza knock down prices
5089448 what nonsense this is evidence of the lunacy irrelevance and derangement of the left

5089491 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5089492 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5089493 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5089494 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5089495 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5089496 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5089497 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5089498 australia has been instrumental in the development of an early warning system for tsunami risk along the australian coastline and this has been a terrific initiative but the same level of attention has not been given to the desperate need for an early warning system for many other environmental crises
5089499 as a result we are now seeing as just one example very serious environmental problems such as falling water levels in the murray river and the immediate risks to the lower murray lakes being posed by acid sulphate soils
5089500 our governments need to take the early warning concept a step further and establish a national geoscience expert panel to provide an early warning system for a range of future environmental crises which if not tackled early on have real potential to reap irreversible environmental and economic damage in this country
5089501 some of the key environmental problems which are plaguing australia at present such as salinity drought water contamination water shortages climate change loss of productive land and the impact of urban development on land health have been on the radar of geoscientists for many years long before these issues became hot political topics
5089502 for example while geoscientists have known about potential environmental crises such as salinity and constrained water flow decades before they have even become visible it is really only once the rivers have stopped running the lakes have salted up or turned acidic productive land has been degraded beyond repair and the wildlife has started dying that governments have begun to take some notice of what the geoscientific community has been saying
5089503 a national geoscience expert panel would serve as an independent voice to provide scientifically based warnings and recommendations on a wide range of environmental problems collectively to governments many years before they hatch into full blown environmental crises thus giving governments a much earlier timeframe to respond and a much better chance of implementing workable and successful solutions
5089504 we recognise that organisations like geoscience australia and csiro provide valuable advice to government on a wide range of geoscientific issues however the formation of a national geoscience expert panel would enable advice to be consolidated from many geoscientific experts including those organisations and collectively fed back to government

5089508 i for one hope we play this out just as publicly as we played out the endorsement of todd bentley our repentance should be as public as our proclamation of revival lets go on god tv and tell the world about our failure our weakness and our courage to face problems openly and without fear todd will find forgiveness from his christian family the overseers will find understanding from the body of christ and we should expect to find them all open and transparent i will have more to say about this

5089514 people were not coming downtown we had to do something now were seeing the results
5089515 im saying its a lie because everyone knows its a lie
5089516 the border patrol is doing it as part of their job they didnt notify the city of any additional activity they didnt notify the police department of any additional activity
5089517 but if federal laws are being broken the city is supportive of those laws being enforced
5089518 the city has not done anything to prohibit that from occurring that hasnt changed that has been that way for a number of years
5089519 the city is not trying to take work away from anyone
5089520 what were doing is normal operations through our murrieta station agents are working their routine patrols along the interstate 15 corridor and the highway 74 corridor
5089521 were a federal agency if we do step up efforts its because washington d c tasked us to do that
5089522 nothing in that area has been beefed up weve just gone through a huge hiring phase there are a lot more staff more agents at each station thats what were seeing and we have more coming we the agency the agency should be 18 000 strong by the end of this year

5089624 lamicizia fra un uomo e una donna sempre un poco erotica anche se inconsciamente
5089625 vero lattrazione fisica sempre alla base dei legami amicali fra sessi diversi la molla che fa scattare linteresse solo in un secondo momento avviene la valutazione pi attenta della persona quello che cerchiamo da lei ci che leggiamo nei suoi occhi che ci fa virare verso un legame amichevole daltronde unamicizia fra sessi differisce da una relazione sentimentale solo per latto sessuale ma ha in comune sentimenti importanti come la gelosia il senso di possesso la complicit e lintimit lerotismo in qualche modo occultato sublimato resta sullo sfondo
5089626 per me lamicizia tra donna e uomo si basa sulla negazione della differenza sessuale e quindi sullassenza dellattrattiva si pu trasformare in amore in uno dei due o in entrambi quando ci si accorge che laltro o laltra diventato desiderabile come partner sessuale per una trasformazione o una evoluzione del rapporto

5089649 in iraq errori ma di ritiro per ora non si parla
5089650 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5089651 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5089652 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5089653 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5089654 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5089655 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5089656 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5089657 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5089658 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians

5089687 this is such a tough golf course that sometimes when you hit a good shot it doesnt end up in a good spot
5089688 my short game was probably the best its ever been for a whole week it was just one of those weeks
5089689 it was about as hard as i thought it would be
5089690 i figured if i shot around par on those last holes id be close especially with the wind swirling around in the trees
5089691 it was about 30 feet with at least five feet of break its nice to be able to be a little more aggressive knowing youre chipping and putting well

5089698 he writes that he went through the inquest in a daze and after that he took to his bed for eight days in a catatonic state blaming himself for her death hes never entirely recovered but how can you
5089699 every time we play a match she always kills me
5089700 she has a lot of good moves that she can show you
5089701 shed beat me 11 3 every game if she wanted to so shes not playing seriously when she plays me but she makes sure i play seriously if you fool around she will not coach you

5089742 hillary clintons rich friend lady de rothschild ambushes barack obama
5089743 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
5089744 the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
5089745 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5089746 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5089747 its not something that i would have recommended but theyre trying to bend over backwards as far as they can to accommodate her
5089748 i think the roll call will be a cathartic moment
5089749 there will be a lot of people who will say oh what might have been and will vote for obama but there will be a lot of tears
5089750 were not going to win by pretending problems with barack obama dont exist he has a huge problem connecting with ordinary americans who think he doesnt understand me he is not modest he is arrogant he radiates elitism
5089751 it is not disloyal to raise legitimate questions about barack obama
5089752 he started running for president before he even set foot in the us senate
5089753 no matter what he says he has not explained properly why he sat next to reverend jeremiah wright his former pastor for 20 years he talks about an end to partisanship but he has no record of reaching across the aisle for any purpose
5089754 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
5089755 barack obama can use the words the american dream but they dont resonate
5089756 he magnified the problem by going to berlin and calling himself a citizen of the world
5089757 he has provided her with a pittance compared to what the clintons have given obama
5089758 her debt could have been cleared within 10 days its ungracious
5089759 barack obama would not stand up and say its outrageous its not permissible and speak up for him
5089760 but ultimately he understands what he has got to do in terms of supporting the candidate and the party
5089761 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
5089762 without doubt obama is more comfortable talking the language of religion than mccain in the past republicans talked about god and jesus and the democrats were silent this year their roles are reversed

5089770 the petroleum group has the best chance of bringing home some big numbers this year following record high oil prices wiseowl com senior equities analyst simon guzowski said
5089771 the other major commodity earner for them is copper and while prices have fallen away in the last few weeks to a six month low up to june 30 prices were not far off record highs so that has to be a positive for bhps earnings he said
5089772 if bhp is able to demonstrate stronger growth in its production numbers than rio it would look to use these to try to convince asian buyers and european regulators that commodity supply is more likely to rise under a merged group he said
5089773 a number of miners have been hit quite hard by rising fuel processing machinery and labour costs mr guzowski said
5089774 were expecting a great result but because youve had so much change over the last month particularly in these commodity prices coming off the market will be more focused on those issues going forward stock resource managing director stephen bartrop said
5089775 the fact that the oil price is coming off its highs is a negative in the sense that the increase in earnings momentum for bhp is going to be diminished

5089811 i remember the night my mother was stung by a scorpion ten hours of steady rain had driven him to crawl beneath a sack of rice parting with his poison flash of diabolic tail in the dark room he risked the rain again the peasants came like swarms of flies and buzzed the name of god a hundred times to paralyse the evil one with candles and with lanterns throwing giant scorpion shadows on the sun baked walls they searched for him he was not found they clicked their tongues with every movement the scorpion made his poison moved in mothers blood they said may he sit still they said may the sum of evil balanced in this unreal world against the sum of good become diminished by your pain may the poison purify your flesh of desire and your spirit of ambition they said and they sat around on the floor with my mother in the centre the peace of understanding on each face more candles more lanterns more neighbours more insects and the endless rain my mother twisted through and through groaning on a mat my father sceptic rationalist trying every curse and blessing powder mixture herb and hybrid he even poured a little paraffin upon the bitten toes and put a match to it i watched the flame feeding on my mother i watched the holy man perform his rites to tame the poison with incantation after twenty hours it lost its sting

5089909 allocating over the long term more than 10 per cent and in some cases when it is structurally weak more than 5 of gnp to armaments is likely to limit its growth rate

5089914 the truly evil thing is to act in such a way that peaceful life becomes impossible by shooting at your enemy you are not in the deepest sense wronging him but by hating him by inventing lies about him and bringing children up to believe them by clamouring for unjust peace terms which make further wars inevitable you are striking not at one perishable generation but at humanity itself
5089915 this conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing
5089916 is it possible to justify the existence of a jewish state over the many years in which i have participated in debates about israels constitutional foundations and the rights of its citizens i did not generally feel this question to be particularly urgent indeed i believed that there was no more need to demonstrate the legitimacy of a jewish state than there was for any other nation today i realize that my view was wrong the repudiation of israels right to exist as a jewish state is now a commonly held position and one that is increasingly seen as legitimate
5089917 more worrisome is the fact that many jews in israel agree with this view or at least show a measure of sympathy for it
5089918 may well lead us into a complex engagement between different religious communities that in time could save the world
5089919 the whole mechanism of dealing with religious leaders is based on long term relationships and an awareness of who they are and where they are coming from
5089920 is the very reason i can engage with people now because they knew me before and have not just seen me as part of the coalition from those days even amongst foreign religious leaders i am the only one still here and if i had not been in several years before the war i would not be trusted now

5089940 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5089941 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5089942 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
5089943 one of the task forces chief recommendations is for better designed rigorously conducted future research on the topic to help disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives

5089946 today we have started the installation of 6 000 new centrifuges
5089947 beginning of a speedy trend to eliminate the big powers
5089948 iran has exaggerated its progress and seen problems operating the 3 000 centrifuges already in place
5089949 with great pride i announce as of today our dear country is among the countries of the world that produces nuclear fuel on an industrial scale
5089950 they are at the stage where they are doing one cascade a week
5089951 confirm ing that our technical efforts are going ahead appropriately
5089952 improving nuclear technology and the installation and operation of 50 000 centrifuges are our aim
5089953 the presidents announcement was mostly important from a propaganda and political standpoint
5089954 nuclear energy is the future and destiny of the country
5089955 most of the shiites are loyal to iran and not to the countries they are living in
5089956 our people feel great pride because our young iranian scientists can produce nuclear fuel the most important part of the fuel cycle despite all of the sanctions and pressure from the west
5089957 every problem we iranians have will be solved by global islamic rule

5089965 sadat offered golda meir an interim deal for opening the suez canal in return for a partial israeli pullback in the sinai which she rejected making the 1973 war inevitable
5089966 finding that israel rejected american peace proposals which involved the return to arab sovereignty of virtually all the territories occupied in the 1967 war and that the israeli government headed by mrs golda meir dismissed contemptuously sadats hints of readiness for an accommodation sadat decided to launch a fourth full scale arab israeli war
5089967 no peace with israel no recognition of israel no negotiation with israel
5089968 the first war in history in which the victor sued for peace and the loser called for unconditional surrender
5089969 withdrawal of israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict
5089970 would not agree to a single word beyond what was written in the british text
5089971 nothing could be read into the resolution that was not specifically stated therein
5089972 a guarantee of the security of the state and of peace
5089973 she was not a romantic territorialist under her leadership israel enunciated in clear terms a willingness to accept the principle of withdrawal to secure recognized and agreed boundaries but she was more inclined to articulate this principle than to risk putting it into practice and she was resolved not to be sold short on israeli security
5089974 prepared to discuss peace with our neighbors any day and on all matters
5089975 that which was lost by war must be restored by war
5089976 behaving like a grandmother telling bedtime stories to her grandchildren
5089977 that they couldnt have it both ways war for us and peace for themselves
5089978 if israel withdrew her forces in sinai to the passes i would be willing to reopen the suez canal to have my forces cross to the east bank to extend the rogers plan cease fire by six rather than three months and to sign a peace agreement with israel
5089979 would come the moment for a major american initiative if necessary urging new approaches on our israeli friends
5089980 with some margin perhaps for adjustment on the west bank
5089981 the price paid for the return to the prewar borders was not peace but the end of belligerency not easy to distinguish from the existing cease fire
5089982 for the first time we see total and complete agreement between the u s and israel on middle eastern policy i want a final peace agreement with israel but there was no response from the u s or israel except to supply israel with more phantoms i e fighter jets everything in this country egypt is now being mobilized in earnest for the resumption of the battle which is now inevitable
5089983 there is no voice transcending the sounds of war and no call holier than the call to war
5089984 in the mood of arab humiliation following the defeat in the six day war concessions would in all likelihood be ascribed to military weakness rather than to statesmanship
5089985 it was a great pity that the arab states felt so humiliated by losing the war which they had started that they just couldnt bring themselves to talk to us but on the other hand we couldnt be expected to reward them for having tried to throw us into the sea we were bitterly disappointed but there was only one possible reply israel would not withdraw from any of the territories until the arab states once and for all put an end to the conflict we waited for the arabs to accept the fact that the only alternative to war was peace and that the only road to peace was negotiation
5089986 that which was lost by war must be restored by war
5089987 was affronted by the idea that an american secretary of state could discern virtue in an arab leader
5089988 the key to everything was to wipe out the disgrace and humiliation that followed from the 1967 defeat i reckoned it would be 1 000 times more honorable for us 40 000 of my sons in the armed forces and myself to be buried crossing the canal than to accept such disgrace and humiliation posterity would say we had died honorably on the battlefield and posterity would carry on the struggle
5089989 my peace initiative of february 4 1971 launched an egyptian diplomatic offensive the only alternative to a military one which i was at the time unable to undertake
5089990 if i had been able in mid 1973 to guarantee sadat the 1967 borders without his having to make peace he would have accepted it
5089991 wipe out the disgrace and humiliation that followed from the 1967 defeat
5089992 i want a policy whereby an arab can be born live and die in the west bank without ever seeing an israeli official
5089993 the yom kippur war grew out of egypts and syrias refusal to reach a peace arrangement with israel or to leave sinai and the golan heights in israels hands the arabs wanted to retrieve the territories they had lost in the six day war without reconciling themselves to the fact of israels existence this goal could only be achieved through war
