710092 heikki es hat ganz sch n lange gedauert bis zu deinem ersten sieg in der formel 1 beschreibe uns deine gef hle beim berfahren der ziellinie
710093 ja nat rlich war ich sehr happy wie du schon sagtest da gab es in diesem jahr schon einige vorf lle und wir hatten lagen nach den samstagen schon mehrfach in reichweite von rennsiegen aber irgendetwas ist bisher immer schief gegangen oder hat nicht perfekt geklappt
710094 f r heute wusste ich dass massa und lewis zu beginn sehr schnell sein w rden doch gegen rennmitte f hlte ich wie es immer mehr f r mich lief letztendlich habe ich versucht so viel druck wie m glich auf massa zu machen und habe darauf gehofft dass noch etwas passierte
710095 es sieht ganz so aus als ob er einen technischen defekt hatte f r mich hat heute also alles wunderbar funktioniert und dar ber freue ich mich tierisch
710096 wie f hlt es sich an seinen ersten grand prix zu gewinnen
710097 sehr gut das k nnte ich gerne wiederholen nat rlich tut mir leid was felipe und lewis lewis hamilton anm d red zugesto en ist sie sind beide ein gro artiges rennen gefahren und ich kann sehr wohl nachempfinden wie das ist ich hatte in diesem jahr schon einige hnliche momente ich habe aber versucht druck auszu ben vor allem im letzten stint
710098 ich habe felipe gepusht und dachte dass sich vielleicht noch etwas ereignen k nnte man wei ja nie als ich das rauchende auto auf der geraden sah da dachte ich mir schon dass es wohl felipe war aber das kann man kaum glauben danach war das keine gro e sache mehr bei drei noch zu fahrenden runden f hrt man das einfach nach hause
710099 f r mich ist das unterm strich eine riesensache und ich bin sehr gl cklich f r das team ist das toll und ich freue mich schon auf die restliche saison wir bewegen uns in die richtige richtung und m ssen auch ber die pause hinweg weitermachen und beim n chsten mal erneut alles versuchen
710100 wie war deine gef hlslage w hrend des rennens das war doch sicher ein auf und ab
710101 ja aber f r mich war das an sich gar nicht so dramatisch ich habe einfach nur versucht keine fehler zu machen und mich um die reifen zu k mmern was ich vor allem in den beiden ersten stints verst rkt getan habe eher in diesem jahr sind mir die reifen schon recht fr h fl ten gegangen weil ich zu hart mit ihnen umgegangen war also habe ich das etwas reduziert
710102 ich habe versucht die pace zu gehen die mir als aktuell m gliche erschienen war und habe probiert diese auszubauen mit den weichen reifen f hlte sich das am ende hervorragend an und ich war sehr zuversichtlich weiter pushen zu k nnen die reifen haben nicht nachgelassen als ich versuchte druck auf felipe auszu ben habe ich ihn eingeholt und dann war alles auch schon vorbei
710103 meine seite war wohl etwas schl pfrig und ich sah sofort dass lewis viel besser weggekommen war als ich felipe kommen sah gab es nichts was ich h tte tun k nnen ich habe mich dann einfach zur ckgelehnt und beobachtet dass auch die jungs hinter mir keinen besonders guten start gehabt haben ich war also nach 200 metern schon auf mich alleine gestellt
710104 ich bin ihnen dann in die erste kurve nachgefolgt denn da h tte ja gut und gerne etwas passieren k nnen sie waren eng beieinander und da standen auch einige r der es hat aber alles hingehauen und danach fuhr ich ein recht einsames rennen gegen rennmitte geriet ich etwas in verkehr es gab da einige berrundete autos
710105 hier ist es sehr schwierig sie wissen zu lassen dass wir hinter ihnen liegen und ich musste die blauen flaggen quasi ber funk anfordern wobei die jungs dann ziemlich fr hzeitig platz machen mussten aber das ist ein streckenspezifisches problem und ich habe dabei wahrscheinlich ein paar sekunden eingeb t was aber nicht weiter tragisch war
710106 man sagt der erste sieg macht einen fahrer st rker glaubst du dass das auch bei dir der fall sein wird
710107 das wird mich sicherlich nicht schw chen und weh tut es garantiert auch nicht nat rlich wollten wir das schon eher in diesem jahr erreichen und es h tte auch in einigen anderen rennen soweit sein k nnen die m glichkeiten waren da nur geklappt hat es nie
710108 wir haben unsere konzentration nicht verloren und konnten unsere motivation st ndig aufrecht erhalten haben versucht uns zu verbessern und sind st ck f r st ck herangekommen heute hatten wir das n tige qu ntchen gl ck auf unserer seite aber das wird keinen im team traurig stimmen und mich schon gar nicht
710109 nein gar nicht das hat mich nicht gest rt aber eine herausforderung ist es allemal das ist ein hartes rennen ganz sicher aber ich hatte nicht den eindruck dass ich dadurch langsamer wurde oder dass es mich einschr nkte ich f hlte mich daf r gut vorbereitet hatte keinerlei probleme damit
710110 kannst du uns deine letzten drei runden beschreiben als du deinem ersten sieg entgegengefahren bist
710111 naja in den letzten drei runden f hlt man eigentlich nicht sonderlich viel da geht es vielmehr darum den wagen heimzubringen ich musste zu diesem zeitpunkt gar nicht mehr so viel tun denn in dieser runde sag ich felipe am stra enrand stehen und da habe ich zum letzten mal vollgas gegeben
710112 danach habe ich den motor geschont und mich darauf konzentriert das rennen zu ende zu bringen nat rlich freue ich mich riesig ich wei genau wie hart ich daf r gearbeitet habe und wie sehr sich das team abm ht um die ganzen upgrades an das auto zu klatschen wir haben in den vergangenen monaten einige sehr bedeutende verbesserungen erzielt
710113 die vergangenen rennen waren wirklich sehr stark nicht unbedingt meine pers nlichen ergebnisse aber lewis war ausgezeichnet unterwegs und sein auto war einfach top mit dem team zu sprechen war spitze denn jeder hat ziemlich stark daf r geschuftet ich bin vollkommen zufrieden f r den moment und werde nun eine kleine verschnaufpause einlegen um mich etwas auszuruhen
710114 die sommerpause steht an das hei t du hast zweieinhalb wochen zeit zu feiern
710115 ich habe meine familie lange nicht gesehen um ehrlich zu sein war ich schon eine ganze zeit lang nicht mehr zuhause in nordfinnland
710116 am kommenden wochenende werde ich dorthin fahren ich werde diesen tag noch mit den leuten aus dem dorf suomussalmi feiern wo ich herkomme f r samstag habe ich ein kleines kartrennen organisiert das ist eine tradition das hat in den vergangenen f nf sechs jahren immer stattgefunden und wird jetzt wohl ein ganz besonderer event werden wo ich das rennen f r mich entschieden habe
710117 ich freue mich schon darauf meine leute wiederzusehen ich werde wohl etwas feiern aber dann hei t es schon wieder back to business und ich muss auch noch die pause etwas nutzen wir werden wohl ein fitnessprogramm durchf hren und uns kr ftigen und auch etwas zeit in woking verbringen um vorbereitend f r das kommende rennen mit den ingenieuren zu reden
710118 meine welt wird dadurch nicht komplett auf den kopf gestellt auch wenn die pause nun zwei monate dauern w rde ich freue mich einfach aber das ist nur ein teil des ziels jetzt gilt es das zu wiederholen und dann nochmals nachzulegen man muss die konzentration einfach aufrecht erhalten
710119 welche verbesserungen hast du seit dem vergangenen jahr erzielt und welche davon hat dir geholfen heute zu siegen
710120 ich habe grip in meinem auto das ist wohl der gr te schritt im vergleich zum vorjahr das gesamtpaket ist einfach viel konkurrenzf higer ich bin sicherlich auch ein besserer fahrer als noch im vergangenen jahr ich habe auch meinen fahrstil verbessert und das gesamte paket die ingenieure geben mir gutes feedback und ich f hle mich auch deutlich fitter

710125 is they took the concept of sanctuary and they applied it in a way that it is as close to harboring as ive ever seen
710126 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges

710130 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook

710137 they are trying to scare americans by engaging in character assassination
710138 i need to speak personally about mccain raising the question of whether obama is a risky guy it has nothing to do with his name or skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment with his unreadiness sic to be president he made a personal insult to john mccain i know john mccain this man doesnt have a bigoted bone in his body it was just wrong for senator obama to have done that and it was right for the campaign to call him out in it

710143 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
710144 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
710145 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
710146 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
710147 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
710148 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
710149 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
710150 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
710151 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
710152 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
710153 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested

710165 the ordination of an openly partnered homosexual bishop and the open blessing of same sex relationships has had many negative results including
710166 there have also been positive results in parts of canada the us and england when homosexual people are accepted as gods children are treated with dignity and choose to give their lives to christ and to live in the community of faith as disciples of jesus christ with fidelity and commitment
710167 we respect what people the episcopal church and the vancouver based diocese of new westminster which has permitted same sex blessings are doing that what theyve done is correct in their context were not asking them to defend that what theyre doing is right but what sacrifice can you make for the interest of the communion of the church
710168 i value the listening process let every single voice be heard but we need action something concrete
710169 and the communion doesnt have the good grace to ask them to make that sacrifice directly preferring to pretend that the western churches have the moral authority to act as their surrogates this is the feudal morality lords making decisions for their vassals

710206 people are on guard for not having chapel hill become a generic place
710207 this is almost a test case its a line in the sand for how chapel hill is going to grow
710208 there has to be a delicate balance to preserve the idealized chapel hill that people come here for but still grow as a town and i think that unwise growth and unwise development could really hamper and destroy the things we love about this town and brought us here
710209 really i thought this was my last stop before god
710210 glen lennox has become one of the iconic places in chapel hill not because of its architecture and not because of its layout but because of the people who have lived there and the life experiences theyve had over the last 50 years

710212 it really hit me and so i kind of said well gosh my momma probably hates the plan we came up with

710223 what i want to know is who wrote your comments i cant believe that you did was it someone from first baptist church the people at first baptist church jacksonville fl form part of the lunatic fringe on the right they want war
710224 your comments meaning mine form the most absurd possible answer to my article you did not refute a single fact that i mr bradberry presented you did not argue a single assertion you just began with insults and ended up with a foaming at the mouth tirade about killing muslims
710225 why doesnt the person writing them use his own name the comments under your my name keep referring to my mr bradberrys hatred of this or that group
710226 i dont believe that my articles expressed hate for anyone
710227 the comments under your name are fairly dripping with hate thats the problem with fanatical extremists like the person who wrote the momments under your name they are the most passionate haters of all time but dont even recognize it

710247 the vast majority of our medical work and by extension our research activities take place in poorer countries where access to scientific publications is often difficult and expensive to obtain with open repository we are able to make msfs research experience available to health workers policy makers and researchers in those countries in an easily searchable format at no cost
710248 throughout the development process for this site i have been most impressed by the support and professionalism provided by biomed centrals open repository team they have been unfailingly helpful and cooperative and i believe the final product demonstrates excellent quality
710249 open repository provided our organization with a hosted solution that was quick and simple to set up customizable to our needs and extremely easy to use
710250 we switched from our previous repository service with digital commons because open repository offered much better value for money and all of the features we required

710270 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the economic situation is worse than we had all predicted
710271 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
710272 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less

710290 the force of the impact immediately flipped shias vehicle over and as a result shias left hand was crushed
710291 shia underwent four hours of surgery on sunday and has been recovering since then his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
710292 we have also received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 mph and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident

710299 t his is what writing is all about plotting a story or in the case of nonfiction mapping a direction to go in and then leaving room to allow the story to take you in the direction it wants to go theres a certain balance to be found between demanding control over piece of work and surrendering to the writing process and seeing what develops organically

710304 when you lose billy wagner thats very critical for us
710305 it got to the point where i couldnt locate the ball inside
710306 its a situation where were at this part of the season where you have time to take some time off
710307 i dont want to hamper the team and continuously fight an uphill battle when weve got it close in the division theres no use going out there and hurting the team by being something that youre not right now
710308 the more rest we give him the better off hell be

710316 it suddenly turned the area into a carnage scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area
710317 there were pools of blood everywhere i have never seen such mass killing
710318 what should we offer the people in our bid for a fourth term
710319 if we were in opposition right now and the country were facing exactly the same challenges as it is now and we were determined to form the next new government what would be in our manifesto

710323 any man who thinks he can design an attraction that is going to be a success in this city and not serve beer or liquor ought to have his head examined
710324 that s not fair i m going to write and tell the prime minister about them after all animals need houses too
710325 we need instead to put up a fight show our determination to change what is wrong with this country put our case with clarity and conviction and ensure the public realise what is at stake when it comes to elections rather than opinion polls we know what will ensure default first if we try to do too many things and dont do enough of them well second if we dont follow through the things we have started third if we worry too much about our opponents fourth if we argue among ourselves failing to defend each other and our leader fifth if we water down our core convictions gordon brown has strong values and convictions the route to victory needs us to do more first see the world through the eyes of voters the best way of defending our record is by offering and honest assessment of it people will only listen to what we have done right if we are candid about what we have not employment has never been higher but people are worried about housing crime is down but people think its up universal nursery education has been delivered but people worry about care for the elderly second we need ideology not just pragmatism labour needs to stake out its ground as the party of fairness and freedom we must promote fairness but also give people the power to shape their own lives so in the economy in public services in community life we need to give people more power third tell a compelling national story britain is no longer a country in decline we have one of the largest economies in the world the nhs has been rescued from third world standards we won the 2012 olympics because people respect us not pity us we must engage with the world not retreat from it finally political institutions become trapped and we were created to challenge what exists and change it we need to open up politics since 1997 new labour has redrawn the political map britain is richer and fairer but there are new issues that challenge us to think afresh building on our record but also learning from it the tories are betting the house on labour giving up the fight theyve got another thing coming
710326 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
710327 weve been here 18 years and the first time it happened was just three weeks after we moved in
710328 jemma was just a baby then but its happened so regularly since then that by the time she turned eight she refused to leave the house without a bicycle helmet on for safety
710329 its not the drivers fault a lot are foreign and dont speak english or know the area they just follow what their gps systems are telling them
710330 it was unreasonable for comcast to discriminate against particular internet applications including bittorrent
710331 they delayed and blocked customers using a disfavored application even when there was no network congestion
710332 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
710333 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
710334 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
710335 it is in our own self interest to be concerned
710336 for a disease that has been transformed from almost uniformly fatal to manageable over decades the impact of treatment decisions is substantial
710337 disease management remains challenged by toxicities maintenance of adherence clinical manifestations related to both the drugs and the hiv infection itself and the threat of drug resistance sustainability and expansion of the progress achieved will depend on maintaining a robust drug development pipeline and the ability to deliver effective therapy and monitoring tools to the worlds affected populations
710338 with creativity and political will the progress and individualized approach to antiretroviral therapy evident in the developed world can be adapted to the public health approach in the developing world where 90 percent of the worlds hiv infected population lives
710339 however a large number of prior reports have demonstrated that because of issues of social instability related to illicit drug addiction hiv infected idus may not be deriving the full benefits of haart
710340 although our findings cannot be generalized outside of this cohort as efforts to improve use of haart among idus expand the fact that survival patterns were not significantly different between idus and non idus should help to challenge the increasingly prevalent belief that idus may be markedly less likely to benefit from haart based on these results we conclude that haart regimens may have effectiveness at a populational level that is not significantly different regarding the survival of individuals with and without a history of injection drug use
710341 since i received the information about the stampede i rushed the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine i fail to understand why the god was so cruel to us
710342 everything was going smooth but when the police used cane charge on pilgrims the situation turned ugly
710343 we have made some terrible mistakes in iraq and it is only by talking about them that we will learn from them
710344 last autumn we made a mistake which was understandable but not excusable
710345 but actually the jaish al mahdi had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
710346 this brings a lot of closure it may not have brought the closure that others may have wanted to see this person face justice as opposed to take his own life but i think they have the right person
710347 the fringe society were warned well in advance about the computer system
710348 it is something that people have been talking about and raising concerns about for many months now
710349 the fringe messed up and they should pay the difference and book people in for another show but they wont do it
710350 were not doing as many rehabs and we have very limited capacity to maintain and clean the stations we do have
710351 we really do not have the funding to do a first class job
710352 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
710353 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
710354 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
710355 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
710356 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
710357 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists
710358 el mi rcoles pasado estuvimos durante horas en plena lluvia torrencial algunos se desmayaron

710361 published in the annual report presented to the scottish conference
710362 the uk government want to exploit scotlands natural resources for their own financial gain
710363 whitehalls duplicity and trickery in its desperate desire to cheat scotland
710364 no good reason to try and keep on their good side
710365 we actually need an asbo against them in the form of independence
710366 we will be happy to keep our nose out of foreign countrys affairs as soon as the english government keeps their nose and their grasping greedy paws out of our affairs
710367 you have lost your marbles mate the stone of destiny was stolen by the english we didnt give it to them moreover now that we have it back it should never be sent back south to the english for the crowning of their german monarchy
710368 why are the labour party and others so offended by the saltire obviously they are ashamed of being scottish and why they have the english rose as their partys symbol
710369 fly the saltire high fellow scots it strikes fear into the black heart of unionism
710370 but if it becomes a unifying idea that is successful for everybody scots welsh ulster english bengali portuguese polish if it remains open like that then as a concept it
710371 the snps civic nationalism where youre talking about being proud of your community that says a lot about scotland
710372 i think belonging is a much more important thing than britishness englishness and multiculturalism which are all hard to define
710373 this is all part of the snps independence by creep
710374 on the extreme outskirts of nationalism to think it is ok to do things that could be very harmful to english people
710375 transport scotland whose own logo was inspired by the saltire stressed work on the new train design had started before the snp came to power last year
710376 we can see value in not changing the branding every time the train operator changes
710377 it will also help bring uniformity because there is a mishmash of first scotrail and strathclyde passenger transport spt liveries at present and different signs all over the place at stations
710378 the new livery gives scotlands railways a national identity without being nationalist
710379 the current range of train liveries creates confusion in the minds of passengers about whose railway it is and who is paying for it it does not create a unified brand image
710380 changes in the franchise do not coincide with when we need to repaint trains we aim to create a brand which is independent of the franchisee
710381 we want people to make the same connection as red buses have with london and yellow buses have with schools
710382 im not suggesting for a second that the snp are racist or indeed anti english
710383 one by one the deeper questions that are fuelling separatism
710384 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
710385 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
710386 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
710387 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
710388 speed up reviews for safety have more than tripled the number of black box warnings of side effects or withdrawals after drugs are on the market
710389 despite recent reforms to strengthen the fdas role in protecting the public from harmful drugs the harm benefit ratio is worsening due to these reviews and relaxed rules that allow companies to promote drugs for unapproved uses
710390 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
710391 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us
710392 i think its a sad state of affairs if kids are so badly behaved they need to be given anger management sessions at school
710393 i cant believe that at the age of 9 they will take it all in either its too young
710394 if youngsters are given a good grounding from parents and teachers this shouldnt be necessary
710395 it shows that behavior of young people has become very serious when somebody thinks that 9 year olds need anger management style lessons
710396 in distressed and downtrodden neighborhoods homeownership is a catalyst for political participation and neighborhood revitalization
710397 by engaging residents in local issues homeownership contributes to the re empowerment of urban communities
710398 this study tells us that a rationally dosed growth hormone regimen does a pretty good job of improving several risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients who develop this syndrome while taking antiretroviral drugs but growth hormone therapy may be limited by its effects on glucose levels
710399 low dose growth hormone may be an effective and safe treatment for those whose glucose tolerance is normal and not for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance
710400 in an earlier study our group showed that treatment with a drug that induces the release of growth hormone significantly decreases abdominal fat without increasing glucose levels more work needs to be done to determine which strategy is appropriate for particular patients as well as clarifying the role of lifestyle changes and eventually identifying new antiretroviral drugs that do not cause these metabolic abnormalities
710401 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
710402 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted
710403 one could legitimately conclude that the extent of financial damage to the bank can be explained by the fraudulent activity of a trader who in the context of unfavorable market conditions abused the trust of his superiors by taking advantage of the weakness of its internal control services
710404 i planned my trip to make sure i could get to the game it was like planes trains and automobiles
710405 the hierarchy at ibrox made a shambles of it all
710406 not everyone can afford to buy a babe ruth bat we want to bring it closer for a yankees fan
710407 i read the headlines of a newspaper that was for sale in a kiosk box
710408 good afternoon chairman akaka ranking member voinovich and distinguished members of the subcommittee i am pleased to be here today to discuss tsas progress on our pay for performance system known as pass performance accountability and standards system how does pass improve security when you get paid more to do a better job you do a better job pass is targeted to reward excellent performance that is an incentive to perform at the highest level to which you are capable pass rewards the individual performance necessary to achieve tsas organizational goals and that increases security tsas pay for performance system is driven by validated data its performance metrics are standardized measurable observable and almost completely objective
710409 four ragpickers were killed and several were injured in the blast it appears to be an explosion of a crude bomb
710410 continued factional infighting harms the palestinian cause and threatens efforts to help establish an independent palestinian state
710411 dialogue is important we have called for it egypt has agreed to invite palestinian factions to meet in cairo
710412 we cant lose hope we disagree and fight but we have to work together to bridge the big gap created unfortunately by hamas
710413 at least 15 militants were killed and many injured in an exchange of fire with security forces near sij bund in matta district
710414 as treatment options have increased and the risks of untreated viremia viral infection are better appreciated the risk benefit ratio is shifting toward early treatment
710415 progress with antiretroviral rollout in the developing world is encouraging but recent advances in the highly resourced world need to be adapted and translated to the developing world to realise these benefits
710416 we havent changed the direction of the development were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
710417 im telling them to not think about the xbox 360 right now
710418 we can think about it after the development kits arrive
710419 we arent going to change any specifications of ffxiii because of the multi platform announcement
710420 in fact ive been doing so since final fantasy vi
710421 the scottish government should negotiate a settlement with the government of the uk so that scotland becomes an independent state
710422 the icm survey for the sunday telegraph puts the labour party on 47 per cent of the vote with its nearest challenger the scottish national party snp on 33 per cent the poll the first conducted within the rock solid labour seat is a big boost for gordon brown
710423 doing his best to keep his eye on the ball alex salmond was today targeting older voters at garrowhill bowling club and doing his best to play down the daily mails opinion poll which places the snp on 35 17 points behind labour on 51
710424 would no longer have to pay council tax benefit in the case of a full replacement lit
710425 if in scotland the council tax were replaced by a local income tax council tax benefit would cease
710426 let us be clear if there is no council tax in scotland there will be no council tax benefit
710427 hps version of windows is also pretty much married to the original hard drive and partition sizes you may not be able to make any changes there either
710428 volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice
710429 dios m o por qu siempre satanizando funcionarios un secretario de comercio no define cambios per se me parece un an lisis un poco reduccionista lo importante de cada funcionario es si se desempe a honestamente eficazmente de acuerdo con las instrucciones que emanan de la presidencia que es la ltima responsable de las conductas de todos los funcionarios y la que decide su permanencia
710430 el indec es un sistema de medici n cuya modificaci n fue presentada hace unos meses en pilar los sistemas de medici n siempre presentan dudas en todas las sociedades y en todas las econom as el tema del indec fue a mi criterio manejado pol ticamente o medi ticamente
710431 volver a a impulsarla por primera vez tuvimos oportunidad de discutir c mo se distribuyen rentas extraordinarias en la argentina la autocr tica es que tuve cierto grado de ingenuidad ante sectores muy poderosos ante la afectaci n de sus privilegios al final los nicos que terminaron benefici ndose fueron los exportadores la lecci n es que la redistribuci n del ingreso es una batalla muy dura en la votaci n en el congreso sectores que siempre se ubicaron en un campo progresista de redistribuci n del ingreso terminaron votando intereses diferentes
710432 hay que desdramatizar cada uno debe hacerse cargo de las decisiones pol ticas que toma no me corresponde a m adjetivar ni realizar comentarios sobre la conducta del vicepresidente
710433 es un tema superado por la modificaci n que hubo de la legislaci n durante el ultimo a o y adem s porque el parlamento siempre tiene un control de la ejecuci n presupuestaria el control de los fondos p blicos es absoluto
710434 en 2003 los comentarios en letra de molde eran al rev s la que iba a ser la presidenta la que iba a mandar era yo porque kirchner era un pusil nime un pelele en esa poca kirchner era desconocido ac en buenos aires y yo era muy conocida ahora se dio una inversi n la que soy d bil manejable y pusil nime soy yo ninguna de esas dos historias es cierta el ex presidente y yo somos dos militantes pol ticos que trabajamos por las mismas ideas
710435 si yo pudiera manejar la moneda argentina o cualquier moneda les aseguro que no estar a ac este es un r gimen administrado por el banco central con plena autonom a y no hay un tipo de cambio presidencial
710436 el aspecto que falta abordar es el de la tecnolog a la actual ley fue sancionada durante la dictadura cuando lo m s moderno que hab a era la tv a color por eso hay que preparar el marco regulatorio para incorporar las nuevas tecnolog as nuestra idea es lanzar un anteproyecto para que sea analizado por los distintos sectores involucrados
710437 los empresarios cuando hablan con los periodistas dicen una cosa y cuando hablan con los funcionarios otra a la hora de los c cteles son cr ticos pero cuando est n en las empresas toman las decisiones acertadas en cuanto a inversiones el crecimiento ha sido muy claro estoy recibiendo todos los d as a empresas que vienen a radicarse a la argentina
710438 es un tema que nos ocupa hay dificultades en cuanto a que se quiere someter al pa s a un plan del fondo monetario internacional sa es la discusi n que hay pero creemos que la vamos a poder abordar oportunamente con la serenidad y las expectativas de un pa s que est cumpliendo con sus compromisos como lo sostuvimos cuando renegociamos la deuda soberana cualquier proceso de renegociaci n debe dar al pa s la posibilidad de seguir creciendo
710439 firm tres renuncias en mi vida a la vicepresidencia de la c mara de diputados en santa cruz cuando fue el juicio pol tico al gobernador del val la renuncia de senadora en 1997 para encabezar la lista de diputados de santa cruz en momentos en que la alianza ven a muy fuerte y la tercera cuando asum como presidenta que renuncie como senadora
710440 recuerdo que al segundo d a de mi gesti n varios titulares dec an que un ciudadano hab a declarado ante el fbi que tra a dinero a la argentina para mi campa a y tambi n recuerdo lo que dije al respecto nunca retir mis dichos lo manifest ante quien representaba a estados unidos y hoy la relaci n es normal y seria
710441 this is an economy where people are on edge about things like downsizing and getting laid off and heres a guy who has wielded that knife
710442 that can mean a three hour trip out of your day just to get the mail
710443 its not an insignificant part of peoples lives to get mail
710444 im sad this incident happened because it interrupted a beautiful and loving party but im happy none of my people or friends got hurt and the party continues
710445 i got outside and the cops shut the club down
710446 no one inside could leave and no one outside in the parking lot could leave either one of my friends was stuck inside the club and people were scared that the shooter was still inside
710447 but my mother recognized my father by his pants and my aunt recognized my uncle by his lighter
710448 its clear it was never a priority for either side
710449 now both sides have to make it their first priority
710450 i do encourage both sides to walk through the open door
710451 the u n were invited to come and they didnt come
710452 theres all of these things that weve been learning over the course of the last two years that were now trying to put into practice and we want to do that on a sustained basis
710453 its a small thing to have to deal with in the grand scheme
710454 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times
710455 while the recent credit crunch has obviously had a significant impact upon the local money market there is limited evidence to suggest the costs of funding are still increasing
710456 the major banks have not only survived but strengthened thanks to the credit crisis becoming the market price setter for the first time since they relinquished the position to specialist home loan lenders more than a decade ago
710457 unfortunately for consumers this shift has come at the expense of competition with smaller regional participants building societies credit unions and non bank lenders losing market share or being pushed out entirely
710458 we are not going to speculate or jump to conclusions until we have gathered all the evidence
710459 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult
710460 we would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks and successful outcome so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy
710461 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
710462 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
710463 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
710464 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
710465 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
710466 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
710467 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
710468 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
710469 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
710470 i saw a little girl in tears she was looking for her parents
710471 luckily she was able to give me her name i grabbed her and ran to the gates but it was too late
710472 it is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage but not a child this never happens
710473 yesterday evening abu mazen mr abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
710474 shortly afterwards israeli defence minister ehud barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
710475 dialogue is important we have called for it egypt has agreed to invite palestinian factions to meet in cairo
710476 we cant lose hope we disagree and fight but we have to work together to bridge the big gap created unfortunately by hamas
710477 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if they are found to be guilty will be brought to justice those who are proved innocent will be released
710478 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
710479 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
710480 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
710481 ma se ne vada mi lasci a crogiolarmi sotto questo sole ardente e veda di togliere il disturbo alla svelta buon uomo

710484 sono enormemente dispiaciuto ma codesti aggeggi se puntati negli occhi di un malcapitato possono provocare gravi danni alla retina e inoltre la loro qualit complessiva notoriamente scarsa e finiscono sovente per danneggiarsi
710485 ma sei scemo questa roba ti fa diventare cieco se la punti sugli occhi e poi col cazzo che la prendo si spacca subito vai via
710486 amico amico vuoi braccialetti di desiderio tu esprime desiderio quando braccialetto rompersi tu vuoi comprare solo cinque euro s

710488 first we had the website which was just a chatroom for cybernats and attracted some pretty nasty characters from that side of the debate
710489 the whole business of this silly website which attracted party members was not really much good at all
710490 something not sure of the name just bought and closed on the good works space on washington

710517 to be honest it is the hardest decision i have ever had to make but also the easiest
710518 and last but not least i want to thank my family
710519 you know you can walk away a proud lad because lad because you have given it everything and that is all you were ever asked to do
710520 i will say that i am going to take a little bit of a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval i just think that this is a big decision and i need a few weeks to just go away and get away from the game and finish the season with yorkshire and i am now in the ranks of all of the other players in that i have to score runs to get back in the team so again thanks i hope that you have respected me i have certainly respected everyone including yourselves so thank you very much
710521 you know it is a fairytale to captain your country but you know a fairytale ending would have been to lift the ashes urn next year but that is not to be i just know that it is the right time because my mind has told me that my body is working well but my mind is not working as well and you know that is very important in high level sport
710522 the players have been excited about that but they are focused now weve gone through the spiritual experience of being in the beijing olympic village but now weve moved out to qinghuangdao and theres nothing they need to motivate them
710523 that will add another 10 percent to their performance that spur of knowing that all these people are behind them
710524 you wouldnt miss that sort of thing for the world
710525 but having said that weve been on the road now for more than a month and to reach qinghuangdao at last is a nice feeling were away from a lot of the excitement and distractions
710526 last year they played in front of crowds of 60 000 people when they played against china and 50 000 against brazil
710527 this occasion obviously brings an extra emotional attachment but i think theyll be fine
710528 theyve got their heads screwed on and weve got coping strategies in place and those are acquired through their experience
710529 they play a really attractive style of football but this team feels that their scalp is one we should take in this group and take quite comfortably
710530 that first game is one we see as the most important one if we take three points from that then we know exactly what we need to do to get through this group two draws in the next game could see you through

710555 list or no list if you rush off a bike and start charging toward the governor during a processional parade you are going to be arrested
710556 in this day and age when security is a very serious matter you cannot expect to act like that and not have to face the consequences our job was to protect the governor and we took it seriously
710557 its not a crime in this country to be a political activist at least not yet
710558 its not apparent that mr krayeske broke any law its not apparent that he did anything that any of the rest of us are not allowed to do this is sort of police state run riot

710652 the big question became how can you help people confront their internal sensations
710653 you notice how things change and flow inside your body
710654 they felt more comfortable with situations that they couldnt control and as a result they felt more control over their lives
710655 therapeutic because it is not therapy there is no analyzing no talking no remembering
710656 this was entrained in the soldiers minds so that they would be battle ready

710667 questo mio bel bambino pareggia il conto e fa perdonare il passare degli anni
710668 i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory
710669 this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
710670 i feel i could have had a go at passing him massa but the damaged tyre halted my progress
710671 i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
710672 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication
710673 i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever
710674 unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
710675 welcome to the world of winning the first of many
710676 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe massa hard and it worked i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
710677 what an incredible feeling i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes massa engine go and i was p2 to get such a good result in my first year is fantastic so a huge thank you to all the team including the engineers mechanics and everyone at the factory i knew from qualifying that we had good speed and weve looked strong all weekend today i made a good start and gained a place into the first corner i had a really good car and everything went perfectly until the last stint on the soft tyres i was struggling a lot and soon i had kimi raikkonen behind me but i knew from last year here in gp2 when i was stuck in the midfield in a really good car how hard it is to pass here so when i saw him in the mirrors i knew i couldnt afford any mistakes this result more than makes up for hockenheim and now we must keep picking up regular points until the end of the season
710678 i am sorry for felipe and for the team as it is horrible to lose a race in this way it was tough for me because when you spend a long time behind a slower car it becomes frustrating and boring when i was finally able to push the car was behaving very well but by then it was too late i came up behind glock but in the end i had to slow as i had a mechanical problem with the rear end and the team told me to be very careful to ensure i brought the car home its true that im the one who has won the most points out of the top three in the classification which shows this championship is really unpredictable with ups and downs for everyone it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result we must try and fix the problems we have in qualifying to start at the front so as to exploit the potential of the car if we can do that then we can get back to fighting for the win
710679 we fought hard today and we were on the pace with a car that was working well which is encouraging for the rest of the championship we scored some important points which is satisfying even though we could have maybe been on the podium we must now continue working hard but todays result shows that we are moving in the right direction
710680 congratulations to heikki for his first and very well deserved grand prix win the race could have been better for me my start was okay but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
710681 i am happy with my result this weekend i scored some valuable points which is promising for the rest of the season i made a good start but unfortunately i made a small mistake on the first lap which meant that i lost the two positions that i had made up it shows that at this level you cannot afford to make the smallest error i am continuing to learn and i am determined to continue building on this progress when we go to valencia at the end of the month
710682 this is a very good result for us and to pick up ten points is great for the constructors championship im glad for timo because he has had a very good weekend and fully deserves this result this could have been better for me too despite my problems in qualifying i was quick today but i couldnt push because i only had one lap that was clear of traffic in the whole afternoon i gained one position early on but overtaking is practically impossible here around the second stops i was also stuck behind lewis holding me up further still im delighted that we are showing such strong form and i just hope we can carry on in good shape and with such good results
710683 this was a difficult race we were very slow and i was struggling with the overall grip of the car i had massive oversteer and could not really push i was trying hard to keep the car on the track anyway one point is better than nothing
710684 we werent quick enough we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying yesterday which hurt us in the race we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the toyotas and renaults who were fighting in the championship lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
710685 my start wasnt perfect but okay as i had hoped i was able to overtake three cars on the first lap but later it became more difficult than expected to race with the heavy car we went for a one stop strategy so my car was almost full of fuel at the start and i also had to take care of the tyres i couldnt match the pace of the cars in front of me now we have to analyse todays lack of race pace normally this is one of our strengths
710686 unfortunately i got some traffic before my last stop which allowed nick heidfeld to pass me otherwise i couldnt do anymore today the car has a lot of oversteer and rear sliding now well just focus on the next race and see that we can do there
710687 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here unfortunately the race was frustrating i made it tough for myself with a poor start which dropped me down to p14 after the first couple of corners i got boxed in at turn one and had a lot of wheelspin out of the corner which allowed a few people to get past on the outside i was able to get past rubens barrichello on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
710688 obviously it was a very difficult race for us we converted my strategy to a one stopper which was the right thing to do so thanks to the team for that after that though i was running heavy and struggling on the option tyres so had to fight for pace i then made contact with fisichella and lost a position fortunately i was able to regain it when he had to make his final stop that was all we could do today so we need to look into what happened and try to improve for the next race
710689 my first lap wasnt great i was in the wrong place and lost a few positions then during my first pit stop something went wrong with the fuel rig which cost me a couple of decisive seconds and put me behind fisichella my strategy was over then in terms of the heat i didnt have a problem with it weve definitely had worse races this year
710690 it was a tough race as we were fighting quite a lot we were quite heavy at the beginning of the race but the pace really wasnt too bad and i could keep up with the others in front of me in fact the two williams were only two laps heavier than me when i was just behind them but i was keeping the same pace even at the end of the race in the last few laps i could do a 1 min 22 6s which is a good lap time in terms of strategy we did well that was the maximum we could get from this race we just need a step forward for the next few races
710691 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me we decided to start with used front and new rear tyres which proved to be a problem as the car was out of balance for the first stint then at my first pit stop we were unlucky to have the problem with the rig which resulted in a small fire and a long delay whilst we got fuel into the car using the second rig after that my race was effectively over as the number of blue flags made it impossible to make progress we decided to drop the revs on the engine and do some testing with the tyres as we had overheating problems over the weekend and it was good to collect some data on this for me the actual race was one to forget really
710692 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever i am very frustrated at the moment because today we had a great car and we had done everything perfectly until just a few kilometres from the finish unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
710693 there have been two sides to this weekend it got off to a good start and then i had some problems in qualifying the race also started quite well as i had a good pace then it all went to hell at the first pit stop as the guys had to use the fire extinguisher and i got a lot of foam on my visor it happened again at the second stop and this time i had foam inside and outside my visor and couldnt see a thing so had to make another stop to get it cleaned by this stage we had lost so much time there was nothing else to do and i preferred to make the extra stop as the lack of visibility was dangerous
710694 my start was normal i was on the outside going into turn one but then i had to go a little bit wide and dropped back a place then the problems started on the third lap when my brakes started to overheat particularly the rear ones and i had to move my brake balance forward from that point on i had problems with lots of locking on the front and understeer and it was difficult to handle the car considering this my race pace was not bad in the first stint but then in the second stint i was held up by the group in front when i was quite light and lost some time there in the final stint i had a puncture on the front right under braking and then the brakes gave up and my race was over overall i am disappointed because weve worked hard for the whole weekend and then after three laps we have a problem so i couldnt show the performance i wanted to
710695 to finish on the podium in finland is fantastic its one of those rallies that you really really want to do well on and its great to add it to the cv
710696 the guys did a fantastic job the car was great and i was just able to keep pushing hard i really want to thank everybody in the team its just really cool to be here on the podium the first time in finland with the new car and of course its great to be back in third in the championship
710697 when everything was working it felt very good but its been a tough weekend with a lot of problems
710698 were sixth and thats just how it is what else can i do everybody at the team is working flat out but we have to just improve from here we have to get the details right david richards is on the case but at the moment its not good enough i really hope we can be on the case in germany
710699 its been our first chance to really see how the car performs on gravel and how the work done in testing translates to a rally and it is clear weve made good progress
710700 chris did a great job and we learned a lot that we will take into new zealand as we continue the steep part of the learning curve we are currently in
710701 and im especially pleased with the way we won it
710702 our objective today was to keep up a fast pace over the final days stages and keep a close eye on how our main rival was going
710703 it was important not to make any mistakes and that meant building in a certain safety margin after spending the first two days driving flat out between the trees i had absolutely no intention of letting our 42nd wrc win slip from our grasp todays victory also means we have met one of the objectives we set ourselves at the start of the season and thats a particularly satisfying feeling i had every confidence in my citro n c4 from flag to flag and this result gives our chances in the drivers championship a terrific boost since it narrows the gap down to just three points its been a positive weekend too for citro n in the manufacturers standings
710704 this wasnt the result we were looking for but having lost jari matti so early it made it more difficult for mikko because he had to think about both championships
710705 he delivered an incredible performance and learned a lot having to battle with loeb for three days which will make him stronger they were 0 5sec km quicker than the rest of the field and i think mikko drove better than last year which is a big achievement
710706 it was a fantastic rally and an amazing fight and its unfortunate i didnt win in front of my home fans
710707 i pushed right to the end but it wasnt enough i lost the time by not being brave enough in the narrow sections ive also learned that i could have made my notes quicker the speed was crazy im pleased to still lead the championship but one point isnt much itll be difficult but we must now fight for the win on every round
710708 and i didnt achieve what i wanted which was a podium i feel quite empty it ended for me on friday morning and that was all due to an error i made on the recce when i didnt mark a rock in my pace notes at least i got my confidence rhythm and speed back and drove the new stages which is good for the future it was difficult to be motivated but the best medicine after an accident is to get back behind the wheel i know the speed is there so i hope that next year ill have the chance to fight for a win here
710709 schmidt told them they would soon see mccain go on the offensive against senator barack obama some tough tv ads were coming he warned it was no lie the first ad came barely 24 hours later others followed and soon the united states presidential election erupted into its most vicious fight so far both sides traded insults over patriotism racism and allegations of becoming negative it dominated the front pages and cable news shows and there is little sign the storm will abate quickly many pundits saw the move as a sign of desperation from a mccain campaign humbled by obamas triumphal world tour behind in the polls and written off by some commentators but the truth is very different mccains aggressive strategy is a deliberate and well thought out ploy it was developed and implemented by a coterie of advisers brought in last month who are proteges of the republican political guru karl rove schmidt who learned his trade with rove heads the group and is now guiding the campaign the strategy is intended to turn mccains ailing presidential bid around and give it a firm focus one mostly fixed on attacking obama schmidt and others believe they can do to obama what the republicans did to senator john kerry in 2004

710744 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
710745 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
710746 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process

710757 want allen hebben gezondigd en derven missen de heerlijkheid gods
710758 god echter bewijst zijn liefde jegens ons doordat christus toen wij nog zondaren waren voor ons gestorven is
710759 doch allen die hem aangenomen hebben hun heeft hij macht gegeven kinderen gods te worden hun die in zijn naam geloven

710771 the pilots followed standard procedures which is go back and land safely
710772 the 767 has three hydraulic systems if one fails the other two back it up there was never any safety issue here
710773 this is an additional layer of safety checks over and above the normal day to day checks
710774 if there are significant problems the public has a right to know
710775 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen

710779 risks of hiring people from germany in iraq is still very high
710780 that hampers economic development should be left german government institutions german decide for themselves is going to iraq
710781 this eventually leads to the loss of contracts and pay the germans iraq where german products enjoy very good reputation to buy machines chinese and korean and eastern europe

710792 there were rumors of boulders coming down on us and we all ran like the others
710793 there were too many rumours we tried our best to keep things under control but it went out of hand
710794 it is becoming increasingly clear that structural factors like the growth in global food demand can be reasonably expected to maintain prices at sustained levels over the medium term though substantially below the most recent price hikes
710795 reasons for current price pressures are unambiguous a combination of steadily increasing demand and lagging supply or production shortfall exacerbated by short term economic and policy factors
710796 in whatever meetings we take part and whatever issue we raise the main aim is institutionalizing our nuclear rights

710799 our aim is to show the swiss building industry and perhaps the whole european building industry that you can build with less money but in a sustainable way and that it doesnt cost more than a normal building perhaps even less

710806 the anonymity of our air marshals is very important to our mission
710807 thats the primary reason we dont divulge details of investigations
710808 we dont reduce many dui cases down to reckless driving

710829 there were so many examples in the media of sexist comments where we never heard from the party leadership or barack obama
710830 were focused on why the democratic leadership was so silent about it during the campaign
710831 it was their obligation to come to the defence of one of their own primary candidates and they didnt they stayed silent during the campaign and thats not okay
710832 we have talked about healthcare about sharing the goal of universal coverage but not about a mandate

710837 for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard
710838 about the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing mat 20 4 he told them you also go and work in my vineyard and i will pay you whatever is right mat 20 5 so they went
710839 he went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing
710840 he said to them you also go and work in my vineyard
710841 when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman call the workers and pay them their wages beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first
710842 the workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius

710855 during sundays cabinet meeting the prime minister will raise for voting the issue of the release of palestinian prisoners within the framework of the u n brokered agreement with hezbollah
710856 there is no need to fear lebanons strength or the strength of its resistance which liberated the land and freed the detainees
710857 this is a clear declaration that lebanon is keen on maintaining the source of its force when dialogue sessions will be held later on we will discuss how the defensive strategy would be in the future and how to take benefit from all potentials and capacities
710858 it is wrong to say that the resistance is the problem and that we want to discuss its status israel and israeli aggression and occupation are the real problem
710859 israeli prime minister ehud olmert downfall wasnt because of the corruption case but was because of his weakness and disability to control the war and despite the immense us support and the winograd commissions forges to salvage olmert he was unable to resist before this huge defeat

710941 the first neutrons met all of our technical performance predicitions and creating them is a significant milestone in the life of the facility and in the completion of the project
710942 the isis second target station builds on the success and expertise we have developed over the past 20 years at isis and allows us to move further into the areas of soft matter advanced materials and bioscience we will be carrying out fundamental research that will shape the technological advances of tomorrow
710943 this is an incredible technical achievement by our staff and demonstrates how everyone can pull together and enable stfc to deliver massive science projects that underpin the long term future of science and innovation in the uk
710944 im very proud of every single person who has played a part in getting the isis second target station project through to this very important milestone
710945 this is tremendous news for the science community both in the uk and much further afield
710946 the isis second target station will open research into new types of materials that has not been previously possible at isis and we look forward to a world of new science flowing from the new instrument suite
710947 this is a remarkable achievement by the isis team and adds an exciting new dimension to the capabilities of the european neutron scattering toolkit
710948 isis is the worlds leading spallation neutron facility and has performed world class outstanding science
710949 adding the second target station is the next great step for isis to enhance the ability and extend the reputation of neutron sciences world wide
710950 together with the great scientific environment at isis the skilful design and the mature know how in neutron technology applied on the second target station will open up unexplored areas for pulsed cold neutron experiments isis can stay as the world leader even as more powerful spallation neutron sources such as j parc and the us spallation neutron source come online

710955 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
710956 packers president and ceo mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
710957 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
710958 the vision is to figure out how to re establish the connection between individuals and their natural environments and reconnect families in the process

710960 they own the land and they can do what they want with it

710977 so many people think that bullying is just a rite of passage
710978 kids have feelings too and so thats what we try to do is help them channel and be able to discuss and find a solution that works for them
710979 thats the key to the whole thing that violence is never the answer
710980 ive always liked the comedy part of it and that kind of stuff
710981 we have to start teaching these young kids that are getting on the internet and writing these things to be careful about the words theyre using
710982 one kid told us a really scary story about how he was bullied every day because he walked home i guess these kids pushed him down in the street in the bushes and stuff so we talked to him and last time we found out he was getting help from his teacher to try to stop the bullying
710983 our grandchildren accept us for ourselves without rebuke or effort to change us as no one in our entire lives has ever done not our parents siblings spouses friends and hardly ever our own grown children
710984 we see 2012 as a critical year if loads continue to grow
710985 they certainly can co exist if there is a need for both of them

710995 the united states word should not be so carelessly broken nor its standing in the international community so needlessly compromised
710996 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise u s interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling
710997 im where im at because i made an adolescent choice
710998 this is not about vengeance this is not about a deterrent or about closure its about the punishment
710999 everybody wants me to say closure or vengeance im never going to have closure its just a miracle word thats going to make us feel good but it aint going to happen

711056 its been an amazing thing to be inspiring so many fashion designers
711057 i was really surprised but its been a long time coming american fashion has been so comfortable for so long
711058 take a power magazine like gq and theyre basically endorsing the show and certainly the style of the show gq has a lot of influence over the way men dress
711059 were so pleased to get the fashion coverage because its just another way into mad men and its an important way in
711060 its just a furthering of mad men being a part of the pop culture conversation
711061 mad men contacted us a few months ago for permission to show the cover
711062 were not a proxy for broadcast media so there can be a shift as weve seen in the quarter between very measurable marketing services which are the largest part of our company vs what is spent in broadcast or some of the other media areas so we have seen shifts we havent seen reductions to our revenue base

711064 on my first week i was saying to people less belt holster more iphone
711065 that to me is for better or worse how i see the brand evolution
711066 we keep preaching about the consumer so if the magazines consumers profile is consistent with certain brand categories then those advertisers will find like minded prospects remember when it was unheard of to advertise automobiles in womens magazines
711067 reader feedback soon after we launched suggested that the rapid weight loss ads were unrealistic and did not fit with the edit in all you
711068 the editor and i together made a policy decision at that point not to carry these ads ever again walking away from significant ad revenue when we were still in launch mode
711069 fashion would be outside of wireds scope since it reports on how technology affects culture the economy and politics
711070 some readers may like it others may not if somehow the ads were tied to technology i could see it having relevance
711071 if its done right and there are 500 real high paying jobs out there i dont think it would be a bad thing
711072 its a mixture of ua students because were at the ua and families from the city so we get a lot of people

711074 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
711075 the status of the dialogue between catholics and anglicans will almost certainly change nevertheless i rejoice in the cardinals opening paragraphs in which he speaks of his hope to remain in serious dialogue in search for full unity so that the world may believe

711107 our commitment to advertising investment is a key component of our strategy and our strong execution gives us the confidence that we will continue to achieve our goals
711108 in terms of building our brand equities our investments in product quality marketing and innovation continue to pay off
711109 net sales and marketplace performance improved validating our strategy of increasing advertising and consumer investment behind core u s brands
711110 the consumer driven model unveiled last month is focusing the company on brands and innovation that offer the greatest potential for sustainable sales and earnings growth
711111 in this commodity inflation environment these companies need to push pricing through in order to defend their profits
711112 and its hard to imagine theyd have had as much success as they have if they hadnt been investing in the business over the last few years to make sure that their relationship with the consumer was as strong as possible
711113 losers cut marketing in a recession and the result is they simply accelerated their loss in market share after the recession
711114 but the pattern is there its not like they were investing a lot in advertising and failed
711115 ultimately because a lot of traffic youre driving is through marketing and promotion youre really cutting off your nose to spite your face
711116 it bought time but the problems didnt get better they got worse
711117 it is true that some companies try to cost reduce their way out of problems and all that does is delay the inevitable problem
711118 its likely that well see more companies getting into trouble
711119 as long as there is a credit crunch and consumer sector weakness the first priority of many marketers is to protect their balance sheet even if that means trimming budgets

711478 n o h d vida de que dicaprio um actor de muito talento e multifacetado mas quando come mos a olhar para a sua fotografia e a compar la com algumas fotos de l nine principalmente na inf ncia e juventude a semelhan a simplesmente impressionante eu diria mesmo que leonardo pode desempenhar o papel de dirigente da revolu o sem maquilhagem
711479 uma com dia grotesca onde nos finais do s c xx os nossos cientistas criam um clone de l nine que por for a do destino vai para os estados unidos e a em 2024 faz uma revolu o socialista
711480 na realidade entre ele e l nine existe uma semelhan a impressionante quase ao n vel gen tico sabido que dicaprio tem ra zes eslavas os seus antepassados do lado materno emigraram da r ssia para a alemanha quem sabe se eles se cruzaram com vladimir ilitch
711481 quando se olha para as fotografias do jovem l nine e de leonardo dicaprio fica se impressionado com a semelhan a interior a testa alta a express o id ntica do rosto
711482 se dicaprio realmente desempenhar o papel de l nine isso ser um grande salto naquilo a que chamamos
711483 nesse filme poder haver tantos anti americanismos de qualidade que os americanos se ir o rir mais do que o mundo se riu com borat

711498 direct investment income the bank of japan admits that the depreciation of the yen increases portfolio incomes if something stupid like this makes one richer of course the japanese will want a lot of weak yen activity going on but they have to pay for all this when they make purchases of commodities from other nations they dont buy much manufactured goods lets look at this pie chart by the bank of japan this is not a good thing it is an imbalance and since japan profits by weakening the yen vis a vis the dollar and since the dollar is backed by a government and economy running deep in the red this is tremendously unbalanced and totally fiscally unreasonable japan is content with this imbalance since it amplifies japans paper profits they will kill rather than let this get fixed when they export half of the transactions are in us dollars but imports are three quarters in us dollars no one really wants to use these stupid worthless yen not even the japanese trade with asia is bigger than trade with the us yet the dollar is used for trade not any asian currencies including the japanese themselves this graph clearly shows that japan is passively making record profits via servicing debts for others they can sit back and laugh while we struggle to pay them back for these lovely japanese carry trade loans the us is losing money borrowing and japan is making money lending we can see clearly when there was a depression in japan during the 1990 2000 decade but not since then indeed the growth is outstripping the bubble years this bank of japan chart clearly shows that exports to the us shrank in 2007 it grew the most with europe since the yen is tremendously much weaker than the euro the yen representing an economy that is enjoying record surpluses and record growth is weaker than the dollar and the euro and also does virtually no trade transactions with euros how about that i dont see any stories or analysis of this queer bizarre and i think utterly ridiculous situation is the euro even a currency beijing nikkei with a new anti monopoly law set to take effect in china friday many big companies operating there are abandoning commercial practices that might be taken as abusing their dominant positions in a particular sector as economy slows major banks face climbing bad loans again tokyo nikkei major banking groups are grappling with a rise in bad loans stemming from the sluggish economy not long after freeing themselves of similar troubles that had pushed japans financial system to the brink of crisis price hikes bolster upstream firms but undercut others tokyo nikkei producers of consumer goods have struggled to pass skyrocketing prices onto consumers out of fear of reduced patronage while their upstream counterparts including steelmakers and trading houses have fared much better 5 brokers bleed red ink 12 post lower 1q profits tokyo nikkei in the wake of the financial market turmoil stemming from the u s subprime loan crisis five of the nations 20 top brokerages logged net losses for the april june quarter while 12 posted reduced net profits toyota can it return to growth after recent troubles tokyo nikkei although toyota motor corp 7203 surpassed general motors corp to become the worlds leading automaker in terms of sales in the first six months of this year it was subsequently forced to revise its production and sales targets for the full year due to its failure to respond quickly to the ongoing u s economic slowdown and surging gasoline prices midsize condo builders collapse as financing dries up tokyo nikkei the survival of midsize condominium builders is being threatened as their business model of relying on real estate funds to buy their properties has unravelled amid the thinning inflow of funds into the property sector in the wake of the subprime loan crisis as well as the slumping domestic condo market the exact same economic troubles are hammering japan the global housing bubble also raged in japan but not as obviously as in australia england spain the us etc but it was there too now liquidity has dried up in japan yet how can that happen japan has ridiculously low interest rates lets look at what those fake banks in japan are offering savers

711562 jika allah menimpakan sesuatu kemudharatan kepadamu maka tidak ada yang dapat menghilangkannya kecuali dia dan jika allah menghendaki kebaikan bagi kamu maka tak ada yang dapat menolak kurnia nya
711563 jika kamu mempersekutukan tuhan niscaya akan hapuslah amalmu dan tentulah kamu termasuk orang orang yang merugi
711564 sesungguhnya orang yang mempersekutukan sesuatu dengan allah maka pasti allah mengharamkan kepadanya surga dan tempatnya ialah neraka tidaklah ada bagi orang orang zalim itu seorang penolongpun
711565 dalam keadaan menyekutukan sesuatu dengan nya ia akan masuk neraka
711566 barangsiapa yang menggantungkan jimat maka tidaklah allah akan mnyempurnakan urusannya dan barangsiapa yang meggantungkan ajimat berupa karang laut maka tidaklah allah akan memberikan ketenangan kepadanya
711567 lepaskanlah sebab tidaklah ia menambah kepadamu kecuali kelemahan dan penyakit kalau seandainya kamu meninggal dan benda itu ada padamu tidaklah engkau beruntung selama lamanya

711570 dan sungguhnya kami telah mengutus rasul pada tiap tiap umat untuk menyerukan sembahlah allah saja dan jauhilah thaghut itu maka di antara umat itu ada orang orang yang diberi petunjuk oleh allah dan ada pula di antaranya orang orang yang telah pasti kesesatan baginya maka berjalanlah kamu dimuka bumi dan perhatikanlah bagaimana kesudahan orang orang yang mendustakan rasul rasul
711571 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan mengampuni dosa syirik dan dia mengampuni segala dosa yang selain dari syirik itu bagi siapa yang dikehendaki nya barangsiapa yang mempersekutukan allah maka sungguh ia telah berbuat dosa yang besar

711625 during the medieval times there were occasions when the cook in the house of a wealthy knight did indeed put live birds often pigeons but im sure it could just as easily have been blackbirds inside a huge pastry crust on his own initiative this was seen as a great joke and the cook would usually have a real pie waiting to bring in when the birds had been released

711627 i had the honor of being one of jeromes pall bearers at the service i hold the honor blanket the family presented me as a special gift and treasure the honor blanket along with his hat and other special items the family passed to me are held in
711628 who is jerome bushyhead and how will i recognize him
711629 indian time took over and it was not to be
711630 once youve had the first four it becomes self regulating i could change a nappy diaper with one hand by the time i was six years old
711631 i spend a lot of time with my brothers and sisters theyre really important to me if im feeling down or alone or frightened its always them i turn to when i was a teenager i was very keen to leave home i just wanted to get into the world and do things
711632 its sort of ridiculous to compare the two because theyre so different but i do prefer film film is about the spontaneous and natural moment it should be the same in theatre but its not also and i know this is opposite to what many people say i think film is the actors medium and theatre is the directors on stage the director chooses what play is done and then determines the style and tone of the performance its all about the directors vision with film thats not so much the case and they never tell you to be anything but natural in theatre the term natural is used in a disparaging fashion i like to come back to the theatre though because of the writing
711633 promoting the parts i appear in is part of the business i understand that and accept that but its a big big intrusion into your life also as you become more of a personality you become less of an actor
711634 but as far as show creator michael hirst was concerned my character was the lenin of the reformation he wanted to annihilate the catholic church and basically did within five years
711635 hirst put a lot of sex in it and made it look young and fresh and edgy
711636 but once people get drawn into the story theyre good to go because the story is fantastic
711637 it really got me in the mode of thinking like a stage actor where you have to absolutely respect the language
711638 let me make sure i get this right you inserted the 1066 clocked it down to 800 added the new memory had it all running at 800 got everything booted but now youre having the same problems as before memory is all set to the same timings too 2 possible problems to investigate
711639 you know this looked a lot less gay on the rack
711640 in my research i was always looking for historical scenes which would seem quite contemporary even though people were in costume we didnt want another royal shakespeare company or masterpiece theatre kind of thing all these english actors in period costumes with elaborate and totally contrived mannerisms we wanted them to be and sound real and think real
711641 henry was a rock star of his time so we use a lot of leather and a lot of fabrics which are almost modern the cut of the collar is high and flattering with garments cut close to the body to accentuate his physique he was the mick jagger of his day
711642 not least because our henry is a young man i showed that in private moments we could have him in a collarless shirt i have used black leather and wool with touches of gold and white to evoke the rat pack of young aristocrats trying to gain a place in court
711643 the thinking behind the costumes was to present a deconstructed tudor that the clothes wouldnt be purist and odd for a contemporary audience
711644 i wanted the clothes to say to a modern audience how sexy or how magnificent or whatever not to be strange so that meant taking the tudor garments and adding touches that allow you to relate to them in a modern way
711645 what ive enjoyed most is that the series is very character driven which means i can develop each character through the clothes they wear so if youre watching it week after week you should be able to tell how the character has developed from the way they look have they gone up or down in the social pecking order anne boleyn is the most dramatic example by the end of the series shes pretty stunning
711646 i thought the old costumes would look shabby and worn in high definition
711647 but high definition loves the old dyes and non synthetic fibers
711648 costumes required for sam shepards kicking a dead horse at the abbey i did a ton of research and then deconstructed what i saw im always looking for the road back what was original about the period i am to represent and whats the road back to where we are now
711649 one of the really great aspects about the tudors is that jonathan really understands and appreciates clothes im so lucky
711650 henry viii had such charisma that when he entered a room people would stop talking
711651 its an old irish proverb that you serve your enemy well so every irish child would know a lot of english history
711652 they sent me six pieces then they sent me another 200 pieces
711653 i was a bit daunted because i saw it was art deco so i designed the dress to go with the pearls
711654 the complexity and the scale of the show and how to deliver it so that its not another bloody costume drama thats why i took the job
711655 i was working in a small theater and the costumes were so dreadful that i said oh look for gods sake
711656 men are intrinsically more vain than women in the beginning of the tudors production the men were so coy and shy about these clothes six weeks in they were strutting around the set
711657 if you had told me two years ago that the tudors would be such a drawstring at the heart
711658 i have heard that in england i am a us resident that silver drinking chalices used to be common wedding gifts but i have been unable to locate a single seller distributor of one im afraid take care wade
711659 well like they say you cant please all the people all the time there are lots of fans of the series despite the costumes and some because they love the costumes and thats imho
711660 i know that i dont look like the americans who have previously spoken
711661 yea vote for me cause im black and im different

711998 a warm and holy man he appreciated the genuine skepticism in my voice and he approached my question with the simplicity and conviction of a man who has devoted his life to the topic ah the problem of evil thats a tough one isnt it mr saab he laughed yes father i cant wrap my mind around it ive been thinking about it a lot well what is evil son let us start with that question okay st augustine in his confessions explains evil this way he says that evil as a thing does not actually exist you see because evil is a term used to describe a deficiency in goodness understand if you bought a whole pizza and it came with only one slice that pizza would be deficient because it is missing the other seven slices where goodness is not perfect that is what we call evil in other words good is something evil is something missing therefore good and evil can more accurately be stated as good and not good okay i follow you father walk with me he commanded god only created good you see so mr saab your question really is this why does god allow good to be missing in the world is it not i guess so father okay well why did god create the world in the first place he asked rhetorically god created the world because he desires that we share in his perfect love you see it is really that simple in order for this perfect love to exist it requires that he bestow upon man the gift of free will giving us the option of loving him how can there be true love if we are forced to love him love without free will is nothing imagine if a person forced you unwillingly to love a woman off the street we wouldnt call that a relationship at all would we let alone the foundation for a covenant god endows us with the ability to reject him and this rejection is what evil is you see evil is choice sometimes it is a direct choice but very often an indirect one thats why its important for us as christians to rid not only ourselves of evil but the whole world of evil as well

712013 the 35 centimeter rule is not scientific as most big pet dogs are quieter than smaller ones in reality
712014 people who make the rules have no knowledge whatsoever of dogs
712015 i know its pet owners responsibility to register their dogs but current regulation doesnt allow me to do so
712016 for big dogs being captured by the police almost always leads to a dead end
712017 we are carrying out measures as we did in the past
712018 driven by the need to maintain social stability the government has softened its stance on the problem of dog keeping
712019 i am outraged by the bureaucracy snub and inefficiency in relevant governmental departments
712020 existing regulations on dogs were made by relevant departments for their own convenience they inevitably deviate from common practice

712029 peaceful demonstrations in the streets by chinese animal welfare groups are showing the strength of feeling against the abject misery and torture suffered by millions of dogs and cats within the food industry today
712030 the scale of the cruelty in chinas live animal markets is immense and it is estimated that 10 million dogs or more are brutally slaughtered in the industry each year
712031 animals asia field investigators have witnessed trucks loaded with anything up to 2 000 dogs per truck arriving at wholesale markets having spent several days and nights squashed together in tiny cages unable to move without food water or shelter
712032 the dogs are then brutally lifted by the neck and hurled into a pen by the traders wielding metal tongs here they fight through fear hunger and desperation to survive before suffering a lingering violent death as they are either bludgeoned over the head stabbed in the neck or groin hung electrocuted or thrown conscious into drums of boiling water
712033 more and more chinese people are standing up against dog and cat eating in china in november 2007 we sponsored our second companion animal symposium in guangzhou which saw the leaders of 39 chinese animal welfare groups representing over 250 000 supporters calling upon the government to end the slaughter of dogs and cats for their meat and fur
712034 in china dogs are increasingly being recognised as friendly loyal and even crucial members of the family and society
712035 changing family demographics such as childless couples and increasing numbers of elderly people living alone mean that more and more people are turning to dogs for companionship and support
712036 now employed as sniffer dogs at airports and railway stations in china dogs are also proving invaluable and cheap assistants for law enforcement officers
712037 we know that many foreigners are offended when they see dog and cat meat on the menu but more importantly many chinese people are equally appalled
712038 i hope the government reflects on the wishes of its people closes this ghastly industry once and for all and allows dogs and cats to be recognised and cherished as our friends not food

712043 theyre negotiating seriously and they are negotiating intensely i cannot tell you that they are close to an agreement but they are working at it very hard theyre trying to do it out of the glare of the media its sometimes forgotten that the most successful negotiation that the palestinians and the israelis ever had was oslo and nobody even knew in 1993 that they were negotiating
712044 the plo commits itself to the middle east peace process and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two sides and declares that all outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations the plo renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of violence and will assume responsibility over all plo elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance prevent violations and discipline violators

712048 content on blogs in my barackobama represents the opinions of community members and in no way should be interpreted as endorsed or approved by the campaign
712049 the fact is that were police forces there we understood that like last week when there was a violent incident when they the hikers came to them the bedouin with weapons we were ready because we knew that this was a place of confrontation they bedouin set up cameras and therefore the police were there
712050 if the police were there and watched the confrontation what was the problem of the police to stand openly and prevent them the hikers from passing and if it was not permitted to stop them the situation as i see it looks like an ambush somebody hides out like thieves in the night
712051 im not the one who decides there are officers above me who decide what is overt and what is concealed
712052 you agree that special police forces were in the area at that time
712053 they wore a police hat and they shouted that they are police and identified themselves as police some were in a hiding place and some waited on alert
712054 all of sudden policemen disguised as civilians but with police hats suddenly came out from behind a small hill and arrested the person who shot in the air and some of the armed escorts
712055 police were surprised that to see how we managed to break through their barriers and we appeared 200 youths under their noses
712056 this incident is the direct result of a police provocation
712057 there is an outpost next to kochav hashachar where tens or hundreds of people intended to pass by openly the police were hiding out in the place in collusion with the bedouin when the bedouin at least thats the version we have began to attack verbally and physically the hikers until they withdrew and defended themselves
712058 the respondents do not have any criminal past but we are talking about a serious incident which could have ended differently
712059 after i have considered all the actions that are attributed to the respondents in the incident i am heeding the words of the petitioners representative that other such incidents can be expected in the near future

712134 today i made a lot of changes and at the end the players were exhausted both those who played today and those who played yesterday this is a sign the preparations are proceeding well
712135 today we were facing a team who were more ahead than us physically but we didnt do badly we could have gotten a draw i saw many positive things in the hamburg game but also some negative ones aside from the injuries today the team was less compact when the german side attacked
712136 sneijder is not right and were all frightened by his injury
712137 its a very difficult moment for him hes in a lot of pain he should have another test but we havent had a good look yet
712138 the doctor can explain it more precisely than i can but as i said hes not doing well and well lose him for some time there is a possibility that its his cruciate ligament thats a tough injury hopefully it wont come to that
712139 these matches are always beneficial theyre friendlies but because there is prestige everyone wants to do well against a major team
712140 sneijder is not right and were all frightened by his injury

712143 these matches are always beneficial theyre friendlies but because there is prestige everyone wants to do well against a major team
712144 we had a wrong attitude for an important friendly like this
712145 the match was difficult to begin with but after we went down 3 0 within the first 15 minutes things became more complicated
712146 it remains a bad blow to our image but lets hope the vacations are over for everyone now theres nothing to salvage lets look forward instead we cant complain about our attack because of all the absent players but we have to work on the defence even if we are getting back an important player like nesta he cannot solve all our problems alone
712147 flamini was the last player who had to solve our problems in this game it was his first game and he had to helped to give a good performance but that didnt happen

712188 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
712189 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
712190 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
712191 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
712192 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
712193 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
712194 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
712195 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
712196 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
712197 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
712198 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
712199 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
712200 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
712201 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
712202 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
712203 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
712204 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
712205 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
712206 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
712207 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
712208 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
712209 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
712210 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
712211 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
712212 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
712213 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
712214 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
712215 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
712216 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
712217 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
712218 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
712219 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
712220 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
712221 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
712222 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
712223 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
712224 we are here to come together for a program of action a legislative agenda to safely reduce the rate of incarceration for nonviolent offenders
712225 the only people who did well in this years budget were prison builders
712226 i am hoping that this resolution will be handed out at a lot of different clubs and organizations to build support for reforming the criminal justice system in florida
712227 between 1993 and 2007 the states inmate population has increased from 53 000 to over 97 000 without a change in direction florida is expected to reach a peak of nearly 125 000 inmates by 2013
712228 its a question of making our society function for all of us lets look at it in a way that understands that were all members of society

712253 these are the effects that i have witnessed on people who have attended this movement and either have had hands laid on them or claim to have been imparted with the spirit they come back with this kind of childlike drunken stupor descriptions of a burning sensation either in their veins heads or stomachs descriptions of being washed back and forth like the waves in the ocean dancing about like drunk inappropriate yelling and screaming like theyre at a football game young men whistling over and over and holding their heads and claiming that they feel the holy spirit about to split them in two one young mans back two teeth turned completely to some metallic finish people with their eyes rolled in the back of their heads and weaving around like theyre lost women just gyrating and pulsating like they re being ravaged from behind from some unseen force drunken uncontrollable laughter in the middle of a solemn prayer time people being slain in the spirit just falling down and being unable to move like somethings holding them down

712274 i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed
712275 additionally i would like to sincerely apologize to those fans offended by my wrongful actions last saturday night it was an overreaction on my part to what i felt was a series of public inaccurate and unfair remarks about me
712276 while my nine seasons there were filled with personal highlights like hitting my 400th 500th and 600th home runs in a reds uniform and the negatives of having to fight through too many injuries my biggest regret is that we were not able to win a world championship while i was there
712277 this is a non confrontational way to bring comfort and beauty to everyday spaces

712282 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers

712347 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
712348 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
712349 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
712350 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
712351 the important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical more easily sourced outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective

712359 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
712360 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
712361 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
712362 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question

712368 the idea on a flip turn is you have to set yourself going in with the proper momentum and timing in order to get the momentum off the wall that was probably his biggest mistake of that race
712369 i couldnt really push off the wall so i was easing into it i wasnt attacking the wall the way i usually do but now that my ankle is getting better ive been working on my turns a lot more

712387 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
712388 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform

712410 as the father of a paralyzed young man roman reed who inspired the roman reed spinal cord injury research act source of americas first state funded embryonic stem cell research i strongly oppose senate bill 1565 kuehl runner
712411 please be aware that senate bill 1565 has been changed since you voted on it
712412 first here is our stem cell programs current law which was enacted by the electorate and written into the california state constitution
712413 c a high priority shall be placed on funding pluripotent stem cell and progenitor cell research that cannot or is unlikely to receive timely or sufficient federal funding other research categories shall not be funded by the institute
712414 as you know our stem cell program may only be amended to enhance the ability of the institute to further the purposes of the measure section 8 amendments
712415 the original intention of sb 1565 to guarantee access of stem cell therapies to the uninsured has already been achieved and without the need for this bill
712416 but the runner amendment could gut the california stem cell program
712417 those who know oppose sb 1565 is opposed by the coalition for the advancement of medical research which is a board of more than 80 medical educational and disease advocacy groups as well as every other stem cell research support group which has taken a position on the issue
712418 on behalf of every california family with a loved one suffering from chronic disease or disability i urge your no vote on senate bill 1565 when it comes before you for concurrence

712574 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
712575 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
712576 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
712577 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
712578 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
712579 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
712580 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
712581 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
712582 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
712583 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go
712584 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
712585 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
712586 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings

712590 la verdad es que ha sido una entrada fuerte que no he podido evitar puesto que era el pie de apoyo y lo ten a sobre el terreno soy optimista y espero recuperarme cuanto antes
712591 estamos muy disgustados por la lesi n de sneijder es grave y es la peor noticia que pod amos tener
712592 tiene por lo menos el ligamento interno roto est muy mal muy disgustado llorando porque es un problema grave y muy doloroso
712593 es un jugador muy importante para nosotros pero as es el deporte nos sentimos mal por l ha tenido muy mala suerte
712594 ha habido carreras este a o en las que he estado en disposici n de luchar por la victoria pero siempre hubo algo que me fue mal mediada la carrera de hoy las cosas han empezado a ir bien para m y he comenzado a presionar a felipe y finalmente ha funcionado
712595 lo siento por felipe porque ha hecho una gran carrera pero mi coche ha respondido bien y sab a que pod a luchar por la victoria este es un gran momento para m algo que desde hace muchos a os era mi objetivo espero que este triunfo sea el primero de muchos
712596 la carrera podr a haber sido mejor para m mi salida ha sido buena pero la de felipe ha sido mejor y me ha adelantado he conseguido mantener la distancia durante el primer stint espacio de tiempo entre el primer y segundo repostaje y me he sentido c modo en el segundo porque estaba igualando sus tiempos y yo iba a alargar m s mi segunda parada
712597 ten a la sensaci n de que pod a adelantarle massa pero el pinchazo del neum tico ha frenado mis progresos no s qu ha pasado al menos he sumado cuatro puntos y mantengo mi liderato en el campeonato
712598 ha pasado sin ning n tipo de aviso estaba administrando el ritmo porque ten a una buena ventaja sobre el segundo despu s de que lewis hamilton se quedara atr s por sus problemas y no estaba corriendo ning n riesgo
712599 la competici n puede ser cruel ahora no debemos rendirnos sino reaccionar r pidamente
712600 para m ha sido duro porque cuando pasas mucho tiempo detr s de un coche m s lento se hace frustrante y aburrido cuando al final pude presionar el coche iba muy bien pero era demasiado tarde cuando estaba detr s de glock hacia el final tuve que reducir porque ten a un problema mec nico y el equipo me dijo que me asegurara de llevar el coche a la meta
712601 ha sido un fin de semana decepcionante pero he conseguido un resultado decente ahora debemos intentar solucionar los problemas que tenemos en calificaci n para salir delante y aprovechar el potencial del coche
712602 lesi n grave de los ligamentos de la rodilla izquierda
712603 este resultado compensa de sobras la mala suerte de hockenheim y ahora debemos empezar a puntuar regularmente hasta final de temporada
712604 es una sensaci n incre ble no pod a cre rmelo cuando vi que a felipe le fallaba el motor y yo iba segundo conseguir un resultado as en mi primer a o es fant stico sab a que ten amos velocidad y nos ha ido bien todo el fin de semana hoy he hecho una buena salida y he ganado una posici n en la primera curva el coche iba muy bien hasta casi al final cuando tuve problemas con los neum ticos blandos despu s de la ltima parada y kimi ven a por detr s
712605 sneijder no est bien y estamos todos asustados por la lesi n es un momento muy dif cil tiene mucho dolor hay que hacer la ltima prueba pero no tiene buena pinta
712606 es mejor que lo explique con m s precisi n el doctor pero ya digo que no est bien le vamos a perder alg n tiempo hay posibilidad de que sea el ligamento cruzado es una lesi n dura esperemos que sea menos al final
712607 si vemos que en la falta de la jugada de la lesi n de wesley ni ha pitado falta qu vamos a hacer es lo ltimo que quer amos se puede perder por un penalti pero no con esa dureza
712608 estos partidos siempre son as no tienen car cter amistoso porque hay mucho prestigio cada uno quiere hacer un buen papel ganando a un equipo importante por eso and bamos con mucho cuidado para no correr riesgo con los jugadores de la selecci n porque son partidos serios
712609 primero tenemos que volver a casa y recuperar los nimos luego veremos simplemente es una cosa de f tbol todos los grandes futbolistas han pasado por estas cosas el volver a ser el de siempre pero en este momento hay que mirar con tranquilidad que vamos a hacer
712610 es una lastima porque es un gran torneo y piensa que como el a o pasado en mosc hay que parar un d a entre las dos jornadas el peligro es alt simo al jugar dos partidos con tanta intensidad con grandes equipos

712614 hes his own person he dont really care what anybody thinks hes going to do what he feels like
712615 ive got a lot of things in my head like when i travel a lot i just see a bunch of different things that i put in the back of my mind
712616 i try to think about a movie like how people might re enact different characters
712617 i start putting together stories i start getting good grades on it and i just thought about it as that could be one of my hidden talents hopefully one day ill get that out there
712618 its going to be like the ghetto version of it
712619 ill take that full responsibility if its given to me and try to do whats best
712620 hopefully i can get a lot more returns i had an all right season but i didnt get a lot of returns so if i was a full time starter i feel like i can make a lot of things happen
712621 we tell this to aundrae all of the time he is his own worst enemy
712622 he has got to do things the way we want him to do it hes a little bit of a free rider and a cowboy thats what ive seen him improve on hes just got to make sure hes doing it exactly the way we want it to be done because it puts us all on the same page
712623 its important that they understand the flexibility and creativity that they have along that line when youre thinking about assignment only youre thinking about that line youre not taking in what the defense is doing and the creativity you have based on what the defense presents
712624 i won a tournament in japan this year and my dad thought it would be good for me to play there and gain more experience
712625 but now i think i might change my plans and go to america a little sooner
712626 to win a major is a dream come true i couldnt sleep last night and i was very nervous today but i spoke to my dad last night in korea and he told me i had a chance
712627 my family are really happy i am here and proud of what i am doing and they will support both
712628 its not as though chinese divers are perfect but there is something to learn from them
712629 the divers in the united states have the same passion they love their sport just as much and their families make the same sacrifices to help them so we are all on the same page
712630 at the 2004 olympics the team didnt do so well but we have worked hard in the last three years brought home medals a for competitions and i believe we will break through here
712631 there is nothing to choose between the united states and the chinese teams we have a lot of respect for them and they are great friends of ours
712632 they push us higher and you have to be on top of your game against them
712633 it will come down to who is the better mentally prepared and who is on top of their game on the day

712969 forse il suo cane non abituato a conversare al telefono venga con lui nel mio ufficio quando meglio lo ritiene opportuno daccordo
712970 perch non hai detto un cazzo di niente non ci pensi che possiamo diventare ricchi che potremmo fare la dolce vita immaginati le montagne di cibo per cane immaginati le centinaia anzi migliaia di barboncine con tanto di pedigree

712997 while the recent credit crunch has obviously had a significant impact upon the local money market there is limited evidence to suggest the costs of funding are still increasing
712998 the major banks have not only survived but strengthened thanks to the credit crisis becoming the market price setter for the first time since they relinquished the position to specialist home loan lenders more than a decade ago
712999 unfortunately for consumers this shift has come at the expense of competition with smaller regional participants building societies credit unions and non bank lenders losing market share or being pushed out entirely

713025 a 1 increase in fuel prices can add as much as 38 million to qantas group costs
713026 instead of a plane taking the standard wide arc approach to an airport the new system cuts the distance that needs to be travelled and thereby trims minutes off landing times
713027 with all the approaches and landings we do every day it adds up to millions of dollars that will be saved in fuel burn we have the system already fitted to the planes
713028 getting it introduced across the country will involve working with airports
713029 a great thing about the qantas brand is that it commands a premium because of the product
713030 nothing could be further from the truth than i would want to make the qantas brand a low cost carrier
713031 momma if you love me at all you will let me sleep
713032 if your water breaks in the bathtub how are you gonna know
713033 if there was security in the south why would we come here
713034 we will stay here even for 10 years until the bombardment ends
713035 do you know the taliban entered kandahar city and broke into the prison
713036 there were armored vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
713037 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
713038 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
713039 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us
713040 the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
713041 there was fighting in the village a hundred times roadside bombs bombardment firing and shooting
713042 the taliban are coming during the night with heavy weapons riding on vehicles and we cannot even dare ask them to leave because if they see someone at night outside they will slaughter them and accuse them of being spies
713043 his mother was cooking and he was lying beside her
713044 the whole village was destroyed and after that we left
713045 we dont know from which side they fired but we heard that
713046 if the taliban fire from over there do you come and bomb this village
713047 we only want a stable country whether with the taliban or the foreigners
713048 if they kill if they wound innocent people we dont want them
713049 if they build and bring peace we will accept them
713050 but i will not forgive the foreigners for this crime

713054 i dont know whether i will be allowed to campaign after this whether i am detained in the lock up or not i will definitely contest in permatang pauh
713055 these are the times we find out who we really are
713056 the u s created the deadlock on an issue which was not trade but related to livelihood of farmers i can negotiate commerce but i cannot negotiate livelihood security
713057 it is disheartening to know that the talks collapsed over the issue of a reasonable trigger point needed to safeguard the livelihood concerns of millions of subsistence farmers in developing countries even the 10 percent import surge proposal from india and other countries was very liberal
713058 i am happy that developing countries could not be divided or pushed around but i am not that happy that the talks failed
713059 in the wto each one of the 153 member countries has a vote that does not depend on the size of the country or the volume of its international trade this ensures that the writ of the large and the powerful does not prevail and is hence good for small developing countries
713060 as food prices go up further in the u s and in europe many poor countries including quite a few in africa that are dependent on food imports would get hurt very badly leading to more poverty social tension and political turmoil
713061 why have representatives of only 30 countries been mainly involved in the geneva talks what about the interests of the remaining 123 countries the wto negotiations have become a joke
713062 whereas the rich act as bullies the emerging developing countries are not exactly holy cows who are doing a lot to improve livelihood conditions for their subsistence farmers
713063 the ability of trade to dampen country specific macroeconomic problems for example due to high food prices will be greatly reduced
713064 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
713065 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
713066 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
713067 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
713068 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
713069 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
713070 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
713071 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
713072 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
713073 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
713074 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
713075 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
713076 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
713077 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
713078 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
713079 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
713080 if it takes the iconic polar bear for people to say maybe we need to do something thats a good thing
713081 were very encouraged by the successful field testing and follow up laboratory testing of this working pld prototype the specially designed antenna is working as planned while reaching the working prototype stage represents a significant advancement in the development of pld we continue to pursue further enhancements especially with regard to miniaturization and the supply we should be able to reduce the size of the device dramatically before the end of this year
713082 how much longer before implants are mandatory by law for all american citizens and those in the rest of the world
713083 there has been a lot of interest in the devices but that digital angel still needs to do more to get the public used to what they can accomplish

713291 we will not only host a quality and unique games but build a more scenic greener and more civilised city in a sustainable manner

713293 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
713294 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
713295 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
713296 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
713297 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
713298 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
713299 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
713300 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
713301 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
713302 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
713303 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
713304 i have no interest in being a martyr im just trying to be a good bishop

713307 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
713308 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people

713356 people see that im from north carolina and say what are you doing in open wheel racing
713357 i started in club racing when i was seventeen and my friends were into sports cars so i just moved up from there
713358 watching justin and the others was very helpful and i learned a ton hanging around rick mears i picked up something new every time it was definitely a worthwhile experience
713359 as i like driving in the wet i drove in the rain in star mazda when we raced at mid ohio and finished well
713360 we started twenty first and were up to eleventh then i joined the fun off track and broke the reverse cable and had to finish with only second gear it was definitely an up and down day
713361 i kept in touch with rahal letterman team manager scott roembke and bobby rahal and when a spot came open after mid ohio i gave them a call about driving for them and here we are
713362 the biggest thing for me will be on the physical side ive been prepared all year long and i think im ready for it
713363 i think it will be very important to be focused on the indy lights since were in the battle for the championship and at the same time i want to help acura and andretti green get another victory with the prototype team
713364 having a lead even a 1 point lead does help your confidence but theres a long way to go so we have to take it one weekend at a time looking race by race ive won cup races before big titles like a f3 fia world championship one off events or two events so far ive never won a long distance championship but ive watched people do it before and they take it race by race and be as humble as they can i have no choice but to be humble because im not exactly running away with a 200 point lead
713365 it might well be resiliency things can turn on you pretty quickly and being a fan of surfing ill just say that you have to try to ride the wave for as long as you can and never give up when you get headwind ive been leading or tied atop after 8 of 12 rounds and 5 of those times i had an edge of less than 5 points and im still there on top even people whore not a fan of mine will concede that i am a driver who can handle pressure id better do as its a safe bet that the 2008 season will go down to the wire
713366 yeah i was determined to reap as many points as possible because the opportunity was there and i knew i had to take some chances but as those who have watched the race either on site or on espn2 will have noticed one thing is to be able to pull off a clean move on a bright day and a whole different story is to pass someone on a skiddy treacherous surface where you have to keep fingers crossed any time you move off the usual line at mid ohio i was able to do more than a few successful moves but i got caught off base a couple of times at turn 5 in particular the mishaps with pablo donoso and logan gomez are quite another story
713367 we have tough competition matos is considered one of the best up and coming open wheel racers in the whole continent hes also one of the best ive ever raced against i have a lot of respect for him hes very fast weve gone head to head throughout the season we may seem to be a bit stronger than the others now but that can change every weekend
713368 i think franck perera and jonny reid are also an excellent benchmark on road courses to gauge a young drivers talent panther racings drivers will be back up front on ovals and my team mates can be fast furthermore i will not forget how consistent and fast bia ana beatriz has been so far points wise i guess shell be in contention till the chicagoland round
713369 success breeds success and i am not winning enough thats what you mean i did not expect this to be asked on my own web site well i would have loved to run away with the title the way it happened to alex lloyd last year and for sure sam would agree with me but you know one of the things you have to understand about firestone indy lights is that were talking about a feeder series here that is its not a place to stay its built to be a revolving door with guys coming in and going out some going up some just gone
713370 youll not be able to find two seasons that you can actually compare because the field is different the winners usually are somewhere else the 2 year drivers improve rookies have an impact and furthermore some of the rookies are rookie by default but experience wise are race winners from the word go
713371 in short no im not surprised that we have to fight tooth and nail to keep the title at sams shop because the level this season is quite high only time will tell but down the road people might well find out that this indy lights season was for motorsports talent what the 1983 nfl draft was for quarterbacks you know the year they picked john elway dan marino and jim kelly all bunched up
713372 no definitely not we always win and we lose as a team
713373 as you said all three sam schmidt motorsports drivers have won races which confirms that we have equal support and everybody works hard because the team is committed to winning sometimes with my engineer tim neff we made the wrong decision and the 7 lucas oil lifelock dallara was not the quickest car on track period
713374 pointing fingers will not take you anywhere having taken part in five road course rounds in 2007 i can easily provide my help in making the car better there ive paid my dues on road courses but having started the season lacking oval experience i could not help at some of the oval venues and we struggled there
713375 its frustrating to be driving feeling like a sitting duck but sometimes you cannot get it right specially after iowa we talked at length from those conversations it was apparent to me that a fresh start was the best thing for me and for tim when you have a bad break you have to explain that and lay out a response and move on the essence of racing is competition not fretting over hurt feelings and bruised egos
713376 its time for an american driver to win this thing
713377 you just cant give one rationale which explains it all some drivers were shining at ovals and awfully slow at road courses some had a difficult transition on ovals for others it was how to figure out how to adjust the 2008 car compared to the 2007 dallara whose chassis has been reinforced it would take time and plenty of different scripts
713378 well possibly you did not know that at the outset of my career i cut my teeth in the british feeder series therefore ive learned something there it seems
713379 were fortunate to have wade drive for us this weekend doug zoster our engineer has been part of wade s successful runs in the past we think this will be a positive for us and look forward to taking to the track on friday
713380 to build the gap to win well make some changes for tomorrow and try to do it again we achieved our main goal to move into the lead of the championship with this race
713381 i couldnt stay close to him with no yellow today
713382 he was very strong on the race anyway its good to be second and well see what happens on sunday
713383 we lost the lead in the championship but only by a hair its still close and well keep on trying
713384 hes such a good racer but maybe the gods of racing were looking out for me today
713385 cars were going everywhere dropping off the track it was impossible to stay on
713386 i threw positions away at the first then inherited some at the end we had a dry setup on the car despite the rain tires and the car really came on strong at the end as the racing line dried
713387 i think everyone knows that rubber and water dont mix very well
713388 i just came into the pits there was no excuse for it
713389 the yellow came out at the end so i thought the race was over it was done
713390 what confused me most was when the safety car came onto the track and then came off again
713391 i dropped into first gear to follow it then pulled off i didnt know what to do
713392 i lost but it is going to make me hungrier for a win than ever before
713393 it was hard but were still in good shape for the championship and well go out and attack every race the rest of the way
713394 four ragpickers were killed and several were injured in the blast it appears to be an explosion of a crude bomb
713395 it is the worst tragedy on k2 since 1986 when 12 climbers were killed due to exposure
713396 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain i panicked when a pakistani high altitude carrier fell straight onto my back with his entire weight
713397 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff

713406 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
713407 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
713408 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
713409 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
713410 we are not going to speculate or jump to conclusions until we have gathered all the evidence
713411 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult

713452 after the killings at the other school i did have some thoughts that they did it all wrong
713453 i mean to say that i havent ever thought of killing people in school before however they guys down in atlanta left behind a manifesto that said they wanted to kill as many people as possible before taking their own lives and i thought it odd that they chose to walk down the halls of the school during class time and shoot whomever they came across i thought that if they really wanted to do what they said they would have waited for an assembly or gone to the cafeteria during lunch time thats all ive never fantasized about killing thats really the only thought ive ever had about it
713454 actually before when i said i hadnt killed an animal before i actual have im sorry i lied i was feeling pressured to answer differently ive killed rabbits before on hunting trips
713455 yes my father is the one who takes me hunting
713456 so your father has seen you kill small animals and he approves
713457 so you dont find any pleasure in shooting a small animal
713458 of course i dont find pleasure in it i feel sad for the animal especially if its still living after being shot
713459 i do it for the sport of it with my family hunting rabbits on my grandfathers farm had been done for generations
713460 a second ago you said it wasnt fun and you didnt do it for the sport of it
713461 yes i do im physically bigger and sometimes smarter however i would never torturer or otherwise hurt a small animal for pleasure if thats what youre asking
713462 i dont mean to appear uncooperative its just that everything i say is being misinterpreted and i dont want to cause any trouble
713463 so are you or are you not looking for a gun
713464 no maam my dad and i are looking for a used canoe i was asked to stand up and turnaround the cop told me he was placing the handcuffs on me for my own protection the psychologists were making notes hastily and then we all walked out of the classroom down the hall and out a side exit there were about thirty others on the side of the building with us the policeman was whispering into is microphone and listening to the responses very stealthily after a few moments one of the teachers i recognized came up to our group and told us we had to move at least two hundred feet from the building while the others did so the policeman and the psychologists took me around to the front of the building i was still in handcuffs and everyone was watching me once inside and the doors were closed the cop started demanding where the bomb was i dont think id ever used the word before now but i was i apologized over and over that i had no idea what he was talking about to no avail he was hell bent on me delivering him a bomb four or five minutes of intense interrogation ensued which seamed like longer with the cop becoming more and more intense with each set of questions finally a police negotiator arrived and took me into a mobile command unit it was a fancy rv with darkened glass i assumed bullet proof lots of computers and seven or eight people with head sets typing and talking at computers he took me to a back room that had a nice couch and a desk where he sat id seen police shows before and i knew he was trying to become my friend by being casual so i would turn over what ever information i had more readily he offered me a cookie and i declined politely you can make things real easy on yourself if you just tell us where the bomb is
713465 i dont have a bomb and i just want to talk with my parents

713509 im trying to save the planet and we cant have a vote on drilling and lifting the moratorium at all and i have the gavel and im not going to give it up
713510 well you know maybe i would accept offshore drilling as part of a comprehensive plan
713511 im personally against it but to get a compromise id be happy to you know look at something like that
713512 we need to drill more and at least give us a vote what are they scared of

713522 when you are greeted with a greeting greet in return with what is better than it or at least return it equally

713524 the game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition
713525 the flowers the gorgeous mystic multi colored flowers are not the flowers of life but people yes people are the true flowers of life and it has been a most precious pleasure to have temporarily strolled in your garden
713526 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
713527 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
713528 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something
713529 you always succeed in making me laugh or cry and think and learn thank you for your blog its a treasure
713530 youre such a delicate flower i want you to write the blurb for the dust jacket when i finally write my novel
713531 thats all right erica you can talk dirty to me in kerrville
713532 you used to be fun you now act like a fascist
713533 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
713534 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
713535 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
713536 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
713537 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house
713538 i like you just the way you are a dooshbag
713539 girl you are slicker than cow patties on wet dew in the morning and you can play half rubber better than anyone
713540 one of the sweetest most intelligent and perceptive ladies i have never met
713541 erica has cornered the market on crap blogging in a highly disgusting but yet entertaining way
713542 i can have a mason jar of grade a pure d buck goat pee especially delivered to the troll of your choice at any given time
713543 erica has a heart two sizes too big for her may god bless her and keep her
713544 omg i so totally rate right now erica has left anti nj words in the comments here on my blog
713545 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game
713546 china julia child and yiddish how do these things go together why in a post by erica of course need you ask lol
713547 i dont do memes and i dont do links i do do gratuitous sex you know my email
713548 as you gaze into the mullet remember that the mullet also gazes into you
713549 we have done some rehearsals and in one rehearsal we encountered periodic rain
713550 that may have turned out to be a test for us so we are very confident of producing a successful opening ceremony
713551 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
713552 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
713553 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
713554 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
713555 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
713556 we need to learn from the west not only allowing freedom of speech but also allowing people to gather and express their political views
713557 catechism of the catholic church ccc c 1994 1997 united states catholic conference inc

713559 an activity in which only baptized believers were to participate
713560 likely a reference to the messianic community psalm 80 8 following up with a doxology
713561 concluding with another doxology that was followed by a community meal which though not detailed in the didache likely was a precursor of the pot luck suppers we see in some modern churches notice this early guidebook for christian worship sort of an early day
713562 the flowering of mithraism occurred after the close of the new testament canon much too late for it to have influenced anything that appears in the new testament
713563 the celebrant consecrated bread and water which he mixed with perfumed haoma juice and ate this food while performing the functions of divine service
713564 i hope the sky can stay blue like this both during and after the olympic games
713565 this will give foreigners a good impression of the city and leave a legacy to beijing citizens
713566 its much better than i expected theres none of the gunk in the air
713567 there is a little haze in the air but that reminds me of los angeles in 1984 but its nothing like ive been reading about
713568 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
713569 a safe olympics is also a key indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
713570 protest by athletes doesnt really mar the games because that is something even the ioc would be opposed to
713571 but i think major protests that the chinese put down in front of television cameras particularly if they are foreign protesters that could look very bad
713572 when you are the biggest country in the world and youre an illiberal regime and youre hosting the olympics then its bound to be political
713573 these multibillion dollar iconic olympic facilities are meant to show that china is not simply the great wall its modern its powerful its a player

713580 stadium facilities academic support center buy into what were trying to accomplish and invest in it emotionally
713581 this summer we did some community service and cleaned the stadium
713582 once we were finished we all went and threw out all of the trash together at the same time as a team that may sound insignificant but thats how you build team chemistry
713583 i follow with deep friendship this great sporting event the most important and awaited on a world level and i wish that it offer the international community a valid example of coexistence among people of different background in the respect of common dignity
713584 each can give their best in the true olympic spirit
713585 to go back into my past and at the same time walk toward the future
713586 it has never been done before i doubt it will be repeated this is it weve got a golden opportunity to fast forward our research
713587 i immediately jumped off my seat i thought this is what ive been waiting for i said thank god for the olympics for me this is 10 times better than winning the lottery
713588 if mother nature cooperates i expect there would be an impact but it all depends on the wind directions
713589 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
713590 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities
713591 hopefully with our data china can see the need to take a dramatic policy strategy to continue the good policies they conducted during the games
713592 in contrast to often dismal diplomacy in other areas bushs handling of china after a rough start has had some sense of nuance and statecraft
713593 it didnt seem like there was any doubt it was going in
713594 i wish i wanted it as much as i used to but i dont
713595 ive been with her for 10 years a lot of wins she hit every green today it is the sign of a champion to come out when you dont have a chance of winning and play like that shes great nobodys done it better ill never forget this
713596 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
713597 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
713598 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
713599 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
713600 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you
713601 the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit that perfect 6 iron and make that putt

713603 this appears to make a mockery of the governments supposed commitment to meeting an eu target to cut red tape by 25 per cent by 2010 it is steadily increasing under this prime minister
713604 last year the fpb carried out a survey into the cost of complying with the raft of health and safety legislation that this government has imposed on businesses on average the fpbs members spend 14 hours per month filling out forms
713605 the government is confusing legislation with governing there is a worrying trend in government that thinks that more and more issues relating to social matters and civil issues can be dealt with through the criminal justice system

713618 my basic explanation is that most of the oil reserves in world are controlled by state owned oil companies
713619 its the explicit policy of opec to keep supplies tight and prices high and other countries like russia agree so exxon becomes kind of a free rider to that problem
713620 the historical perspective is that the oil companies always blame the environmentalists

713628 the hope of some scientists is that they might be able to harness stem cells and program them to generate pluripotent stem cell lines capable of differentiating into many different types of cells which have the genes of patients
713629 this would open up the possibility of producing a large supply of immune matched cells to that patient that could be used in transplantation methodologies
713630 the other hope and one thats much closer upon us is if you could produce the cell types that become sick in that person you might be able to use them in the laboratory to come to understand basic aspects of the disease and take the study of disease out of patients where its very difficult and put it into the petri dish
713631 we dont at all fully understand als and it is our lack of understanding of that disease process which we believe is preventing us from developing more effective treatments
713632 because the disease process is happening in the spinal cord in the central nervous system of patients we dont at all have access to living examples of the neurons that are undergoing the disease process no way could we go to als patients and take samples of their motor neurons
713633 there are still several important caveats for these cells that weve made that are important to be aware of
713634 but for the moment were going to have to press forward with scnt research just in case that doesnt work out

713641 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
713642 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
713643 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
713644 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
713645 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
713646 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
713647 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
713648 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
713649 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed

713669 visst r det konstigt trots kunskap om att det f rekommer verv ld fr n ordningsvakter tar polisen f r givet att i valet mellan tre nerslagna m nniskor och sju utan en skr ma r det de slagna offren som r de skyldiga

713673 det finns tillr ckligt underlag f r att h vda att det tycks f rekomma att vissa ordningsvakter i inte obetydlig omfattning talar helt eller delvis osanning n r de h rs i m l r rande krogv ld
713674 det st r emellertid klart att de krogg ster som uts tts f r l gner fr n vakter samtidigt uts tts f r avsev rda risker i fr ga om r ttss kerheten i de bed mningar som domstolen har att g ra

713955 at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so i cant complain
713956 it was not as bad as it could have been and not as good either
713957 its just unfortunate i was the one to get a puncture and it was a case of oh no not again
713958 i had it several times last year and thats what lost me the championship
713959 but my lead is bigger now and you would never have thought that with all that has gone on this year
713960 it was a tough day and one well probably learn from
713961 ferrari were strong although if we had been out in front then it perhaps would have been a little different
713962 but they showed some really strong pace which we knew they had its just you guys the media that seem to think there is a huge difference
713963 we had a little bit of luck on our side but it doesnt feel any worse
713964 the team knew the potential was there but we just havent been able to nail it on a sunday
713965 but we just kept our focus worked logically to improve and were heading in the right direction
713966 the race just shows you how close its going to be until the end of the season and we just have to keep pushing our development
713967 we have new parts coming all the time and im confident we will be able to join the fight but it will be close all the time

714031 in the beginners mind there are many possibilities in the experts there are few
714032 i was adamant i was going to get it right
714033 ive put a lot of hours in got good support from the boys and as i say from the coaching staff and we just got stuck into it and it came off
714034 it is good to see that nothing has changed in the game it comes down to that most often having passion
714035 weve got a responsibility now to use it the performance as a yardstick were trying to bring through a lot of young players and if you can bring them through in that sort of environment where you lay it all out like that it has got to be good for new zealand rugby for the future
714036 it just shows you something about the game and sometimes how you are meant to play it
714037 but you cant get too carried away its one victory ive been here long enough now to know youve just got to earn them week after week
714038 thatll be the next challenge for us to lay that sort of platform and show the same sort of passion
714039 i thought the referee mark lawrence refereed very well tonight hes gained a lot of confidence over the last couple of years i thought he was very good that helps
714040 it gives us a foundation it gives us some confidence it gives us a wee bit of relief from the pressure and you know what that has been like and so we can build from there hopefully
714041 the forwards played really well today they made the first half because they did all the hard work and then we got the wind in the second half and that made it a lot easier
714042 then i thought i would go through with it i thought i actually dropped it really badly and it wouldnt go through but it just made it
714043 if it was any other province that beating auckland would be their season they would just be happy that they beat auckland hopefully we can take what we can from that game and just move on forward and get some more wins
714044 we havent put any pressure on ourselves and in that game there we could have panicked and rushed things but the coach has given us a word that we use when it is tight and the boys were yelling that out there
714045 the boys are a lot fitter and we may give away a bit of size but the fitness helps
714046 the first half we obviously had a lot of ball the points didnt come our way and we coughed it up a fair bit and at halftime we talked about retaining ball and playing for territory
714047 auckland like to move the ball thats something we concentrated on all week and we wanted to shut their time and space down and we were able to do that
714048 the set piece was very good weve done a lot of work with the scrum
714049 we dont want to get too far ahead of ourselves thats a different auckland side to what it has been the last few years and its a long competition weve got little things that we want to achieve through the year and thats the first one out of the way
714050 well done to counties they thoroughly deserved it and weve just got to get back on the horse and get going again
714051 we werent able to put the game plan we had practiced all week but mainly due to the passion that counties showed
714052 we talked about it but its all very well talking about it we just didnt execute our game plan as well as we wanted to and we paid the price
714053 the game is still the basics you get your quality ball and then you can launch
714054 he continued telling others about christ even after he had jumped into the water and was clinging to a piece of wreckage hed already given his lifejacket to another man
714055 when i was drifting alone on a spar that awful night
714056 the tide brought mr harper also on a piece of wreck near me man he said are you saved from sin and death by christ no i said i am not he replied believe in the lord jesus christ and you will be saved
714057 the waves bore him away but brought him back a little later and he asked if i had allowed christ to save me yet no i said i cannot honestly say that i have he said again believe in jesus christ and shortly after he went down and there alone in the night and with two miles of water under me i believed
714058 for i am not ashamed of the gospel the good news of life forever with god for all who turn from sin and believe in jesus christ it is the power of god for salvation to everyone who has faith to the jew first and also to the greek which means everybody else
714059 i am speaking the truth in christ i am not lying my conscience confirms it by the holy spirit i have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart for i could wish that i myself were accursed and cut off from christ for the sake of my own people my kindred according to the flesh they are israelites and to them belong the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and from them according to the flesh comes the messiah who is over all god blessed forever amen

714063 but we are in charge of our own destiny if we can win the remaining games then weve got a big show

714145 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
714146 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
714147 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
714148 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
714149 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
714150 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
714151 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed

714176 the court finds the memorial at mt soledad including its latin cross communicates the primarily nonreligious messages of military service death and sacrifice
714177 as such despite its location on public land the memorial is constitutional
714178 if you want to put a cross on your front lawn we will be the first to defend you
714179 when the government is sponsoring and endorsing the preeminent symbol of one religion thats when we have a problem
714180 along with numerous purely secular symbols in an overall context that reinforces its secular message
714181 it is a 43 foot cross on one of the highest points in san diego
714182 if the cross is not a religious symbol i dont know what is
714183 these same babysteps are what we all have to selves to take so many times in our quest to get
714184 i cant be anti semitic you jews arent semitic youre khazars just look at your skin color
714185 i am happy that in the spd there are a number of opinions represented from wolfgang clement to erhard eppler
714186 team members who always shoot the ball into their own goal shouldnt be surprised if they suddenly arent welcome anymore
714187 clements comments prior to the election in hesse were of course underhanded and disruptive but they shouldnt have been taken any more seriously than those of statler and waldorf in the muppet show they only became politically important because of the massive attention that was called to them had he been ignored nobody would remember his comments now
714188 clement was also never the future of the party rather he has always been part of its conscience he understands how to guide the spd to power on both the state and national level and how to keep it there his left wing critics have a lot to learn
714189 the decision of the north rhine westphalia arbitration commission to throw clement out of the party isnt just dumb it is a nationwide debacle for the spd clement may be arrogant and he may have made a number of mistakes but the blow delivered to a man who has dedicated 38 years of his life to the spd is excessive and it is misguided because it shows just how little freedom of expression there is in parts of the spd
714190 the federal party may be furious but it should also be worried that worse might be around the corner the clement debate will also bring a new debate about the policies of the schr der era and about the partys direction
714191 a reprimand is the mildest punishment that a party arbitration commission can mete out for infringements the like clements wolfgang clement should have accepted a reprimand handed down earlier because he had earned it but as usual he refused to admit wrongdoing when it came to the next level of hearings his stubbornness provided grist to the mill of those who wanted him thrown out of the spd
714192 clements offense is to be a prime mover behind the agenda 2010 reforms and one of the loudest voices against efforts to water them down schr der is out of the picture and former party chair and government minister franz m ntefering is likewise quiet clements warning against ypsilantis energy policies in hesse finally gave his enemies an excuse to shut him up should the efforts to throw him out succeed the spd may soon lose more members on the right as well as on the left
714193 this is the worst thing that could possibly have happened to the spd
714194 were not going to stand for this violence thats taking our young people
714195 the impact of the rising fuel prices on the local economy is extremely serious
714196 the entire government must make all out efforts to overcome the difficult situation

714199 very hot when we asked them for more information bush laughed and said when we share information with your guys the bad guys always run away
714200 the question is why its taken the americans so long to see what the isi is doing
714201 weve been telling them for years but they wouldnt buy it
714202 there is no involvement by the isi of any form in afghanistan
714203 the security of pakistan afghanistan the entire region and maybe that of the whole world will be determined by developments in the tribal areas over the next few months
714204 the indian embassy bombing seems to have finally provided it this is the smoking gun weve all been looking for
714205 what we were trying to do was bring national security and the war on terror under the interior ministry but it was wrongly announced
714206 they said they were still waiting for a signal to act in the tribal areas to be honest none of us could think of a thing they had done in six months
714207 we need to identify these people and weed them out
714208 it was the first thing i read on my blackberry when i got off the plane
714209 its been common knowledge for many years that the isi is behind the taliban

714216 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
714217 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
714218 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
714219 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
714220 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
714221 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
714222 an atlantic beach woman was taken into police custody after investigators said
714223 at least 15 militants were killed and many injured in an exchange of fire with security forces near sij bund in matta district
714224 some sort of statement of shared beliefs and a more or less binding agreement to stick to them
714225 it seems that a number of groups of clergy have voted for a ban on gay bishops and church blessings for homosexual couples as part of a long term plan to preserve at least the core of the communion
714226 bullies always come back for more and the one thing that i think the archbishop is blind to is the fact that nothing short of total victory will satisfy these guys
714227 embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other
714228 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
714229 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
714230 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
714231 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on
714232 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
714233 five minutes later a strong gas smell took over the dormitories followed by the deafening explosion we felt the flames rise up around us
714234 a national unity government is the answer if the likud doesnt want to join there are other parties in the knesset and i am certain that they will join a coalition led by me
714235 my ability to form a national unity government a national emergency government is extremely high
714236 governmental stability because israel is facing large existential security challenges
714237 i wouldnt recommend that anyone predict the future on the basis of the polls
714238 it is a matter of the mood and it will change i am certain that i will win the primary
714239 we are serious in talks and we want the talks to be based on the law so it will bear practical results we hope that other sides are serious too
714240 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
714241 when we were in france we told them about the syrian position on irans nuclear issue but they asked us if we have details of the iranian programme
714242 in this trip we got details so in future if we are asked again we know irans position
714243 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks and this is a clear message to the international community to continue with real and effective sanctions
714244 we need to understand that we need to act today in terms of sanctions sanctions can be effective as long as the iranians and the entire world understand that all the options are on the table
714245 a lot of the riders report they have smarting eyes sinus congestion and headaches
714246 you look at all the cities we go into and how densely populated they are

714255 having begun in the spirit are you now being perfected in the flesh
714256 this is the first time in my life that i have felt i am actually doing something about what the democrats have done in the past and are doing now to black people
714257 if the democrats had left us alone after the republicans freed us from slavery we wouldnt be having this discussion today they are keeping blacks in virtual slavery
714258 obviously we werent consulted before she decided to do any of this
714259 its a fruitless debate and it may conjure up more ill will toward the party we should be spending money on debating the democrats on the issues
714260 look beyond barack obamas skin color and soaring rhetoric and see an arrogant elitist millionaire
714261 we would tell her you cant go around bashing the democratic party and then expect them to come to our side in droves
714262 she would take the approach well youre not a real republican then
714263 i spent a few thousand and garnered half a million in free coverage by my estimate
714264 they have been convinced wrongly the republican party is a racist party

714269 this bond isnt about slapping another coat of paint on the problem its about fundamentally transforming our district into small safe and independent schools
714270 the way this bond has been teed up borders on incompetence
714271 two weeks ago we were talking about a well thought 3 2 billion bond in the last 10 days with pressure from the charter school community the mayor and eli broad it doubled
714272 its a shortsighted policy that confuses taking a course with learning

714274 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
714275 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
714276 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections
714277 we need a comprehensive national aids strategy with measurable outcome targets a timeline for action increased funding and a particular focus on those most at risk including racial and ethnic minorities
714278 living with the dual burdens of racism and sexism slave women in the plantation south assumed roles within the family and community that contrasted sharply with traditional female roles in the larger american society in this ground breaking book deborah gray white explores the situation of these women comparing the myths that stereotyped them with the realities of their lives

714289 as we now have developed treatments that are easier to take in terms of number of pills number of doses in the day and potential adverse effects and we now know there seem to be additional benefits with starting earlier the pendulum is swinging back to starting treatment earlier
714290 also importantly is the recognition of comorbidities that should prompt you to start treatment earlier including cardiovascular risk and hiv associated necropathy
714291 the take home message is prevention is always better than treatment which seems to be possible through the utilization of the latest diagnostic techniques

714294 at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so i cant complain
714295 it was not as bad as it could have been and not as good either
714296 its just unfortunate i was the one to get a puncture and it was a case of oh no not again
714297 i had it several times last year and thats what lost me the championship
714298 but my lead is bigger now and you would never have thought that with all that has gone on this year
714299 it was a tough day and one well probably learn from
714300 ferrari were strong although if we had been out in front then it perhaps would have been a little different
714301 but they showed some really strong pace which we knew they had its just you guys the media that seem to think there is a huge difference
714302 we had a little bit of luck on our side but it doesnt feel any worse
714303 the team knew the potential was there but we just havent been able to nail it on a sunday
714304 but we just kept our focus worked logically to improve and were heading in the right direction
714305 the race just shows you how close its going to be until the end of the season and we just have to keep pushing our development
714306 we have new parts coming all the time and im confident we will be able to join the fight but it will be close all the time
714307 heikki drove superbly scoring his first victory in fine style and converting his excellent qualifying pace which has been apparent all season into a thoroughly well deserved win

714347 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the economic situation is worse than we had all predicted
714348 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
714349 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less
714350 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
714351 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
714352 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
714353 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become

714359 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
714360 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
714361 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
714362 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
714363 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
714364 well maybe it will as its part of a larger energy package
714365 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
714366 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
714367 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
714368 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
714369 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
714370 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
714371 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
714372 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
714373 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
714374 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
714375 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
714376 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate

714395 before i posted that sign people kept tripping over him
714396 darn these psuedo stalkers not only are they lushes they cant follow the 3 word rule

714399 we never thought anyone else would care to try it
714400 the issue of parachutes will undoubtedly reduce pilots aggressive and fighting spirit because the knowledge that this apparatus is available will soften the pilots resolve to engage the enemy more closely
714401 we had been out on a raid and were flying back near ghent belgium which we thought a safe distance from the lines
714402 that was why the engineers were constantly tinkering with their motors
714403 but the night was passing and to avoid running into their fire again we made a detour which delayed us somewhat
714404 imagine our surprise then to find an airplane coming at us from the rear
714405 that meant it was an enemy plane already in the best position to attack for we could not fight him from the control car
714406 an instant later i felt a shock the ship trembled my wheel went dead there was no feel to it and i knew our controls had been shot away as the car lurched sidewise i was knocked flat and it must have been while i was trying to regain my feet that the rest of the crew either jumped or were thrown out for i saw none of them again and well might they have jumped for the great hull of the ship was now a roaring blistering hell we were falling a blazing mass without thinking i flattened myself on the floor and gripped the boards trying to escape the unbearable heat from above which was actually roasting me i wondered how long it would take to fall a mile that would be the end i knew but it would be a blessing for then i would no longer feel that terrible heat then it let up the car had torn loose from the ship but everything went black and i came to my senses here in the hospital
714407 do you know what is happening with your website because it is anarchy over there do you have a gun

714641 instead of learning from the life learn for the life
714642 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
714643 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
714644 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age

714651 consumers are looking for easy answers and when i shop i prefer to see a logo on something and just buy it
714652 but the biggest piece of advice i have is dont buy a product because it has some green dot on it unless you understand exactly what that green dot means

714662 i am convinced that its all about eagerness that its missing i must find it get it back its out there its probably pointless to talk about it its a bit zen ill never make it as long as i try to only when i dont try will i make it fucking buddhists they think theyre so bloody clever
714663 i flipped through some pages but started sweating and had to put it down it was too much for me there are limits to what i can handle right now i walked around the flat for awhile feeling uneasy to divert my thoughts i started to look through one of my brothers old photo albums there are several photographs of me there i am little and often dressed in the strangest clothes corduroy always corduroy i must have had outrageous self confidence as a child

714665 what do they know of cricket who only cricket know
714666 it was one of the rare mornings when the sun shone and you could glimpse the green grass and the english style houses in the distance this is theirs he thought they can keep it you had to be british or like the british to want to come and freeze your arse off here when over there lay argentina so fine and wide and with the sun shining down on it
714667 the dillos had plenty of time in between shifts of digging they always dug in the morning so that the wind would cover the noise of falling rocks they talked together what do you want a shag sleep a good bath to be home to sleep in laundered white sheets have a shag to have a decent meal think about that grilled beef see my folks they couldnt believe it they checked your folks yes and then a shag and a bath said the one who talked about his old folks at homer to cover his embarrassment

714674 so this is a song that zack and i wrote and recorded together he wrote most of the lyrics and i did most of the guitar work the inspiration behind the lyrics and the mood the guitar line sets may be obvious to some people but its definitely one that we both know well and have experienced individually

714676 we are really excited about this new enhancement of the clia id card
714677 this initiative by clia is in response to discussion and recommendation by the clia travel agent advisory board our purpose in recommending this change was to upgrade the clia id card to recognize professional agents committed to enhancing their professional skills through continuing education leading to advanced certification and those agents who have already achieved that status
714678 clia has an obligation to provide member benefits including the option of obtaining a clia id card
714679 we also have an obligation to provide member cruise lines and other industry partners assurance that our agent partners are actively engaged in the sale of travel and are committed to professional development
714680 clias training programs are frequently acknowledged as the best in the travel industry and we strongly believe that this evolution of id card requirements is a win win win situation for the clia agent for the traveling consumer and for industry suppliers who recognize the value of clia agents
714681 i feel good that as one of the travel professionals who spoke out about clias id requirements that it finally found its way home im proud of clia and terry dale for implementing these new requirements hats off to them its important we continue the fight for increased agent standards
714682 as for me i plan to keep it going clias move was a very important step in this direction now we just need the true ossn and travel sellers nacta to follow with increased requirements to help prevent the pseudo agents from focusing on them
714683 clia certification is proven to increase travel agent sales and enhances industry position and credibility it also provides the traveling consumer a higher level of service and professionalism and demonstrates to the industry supplier that the clia agent is a dedicated professional it makes perfect sense to enhance the value of the clia id card by making these new modifications

714706 we will take part in any negotiations and talk about any issue which consolidates our nuclear rights but iran will not give an inch on its nuclear rights mahmoud ahmadinejad noted
714707 given the iranian nuclear standoff syria attaches great importance to international treaties directly related to the issue as to international accords iran has the right to enrich uranium and to operate a nuclear plant like any other state
714708 despite efforts made by certain states to disrupt tehran damascus ties these relations will remain unshakable and permanent
714709 i am the author of my life my story goes how i want it to go
714710 i am in love with every church and mosque and temple and any kind of shrine because i know that
714711 but hes not so pleased about the reception hip hop and rap have received in grand rapids and hes not alone among local performers who feel their music has gotten to make a bad pun a bad rap even though they do see some recent improvements on the local scene
714712 the average american probably views hip hop in a negative way because of what they see portrayed on the videos especially if you dont understand the culture
714713 we also turn our hardships of wanting to create violence into an off switch by expressing our feelings and over exaggerated emotions into words or lyrics or other forms of poetry
714714 at our events we try to invite everybody and make it multicultural
714715 unfortunately this group of people had a problem with that group of people and the shooting just so happened to be there it could have been anywhere
714716 our music doesnt promote violence but its hard for people to see that
714717 were trying to get it back to its original form it doesnt have to be about drugs money and violence the more we do shows the more people come and we can demonstrate that on a consistent basis
714718 the biggest concern is that theyre not hearing our advertising
714719 to overlook that is to overlook a large spectrum of culture
714720 incidences of violence are not really what people think it is far and few between
714721 once i dropped the word hip hop clubs shut doors tried to renege on contracts changed dress codes
714722 all out of the fear and ignorance of what hip hop is
714723 they want my business they want my money but slap some dress codes on it and kill the things im about
714724 i dont believe wearing a hoody makes you a bad person
714725 i never wanted a dress code and we didnt have a dress code and we didnt have any violence issues ever
714726 i think we hit with such a broad spectrum of people because we have a voice for almost every type of person
714727 its not that grand rapids sucks or is lame it just has a much smaller base to pull from
714728 we need to make a concerted effort to work together
714729 we went out to see them a few times and saw the energy and the passion for the music they had

714740 what the mystics called the secret of one is the inner unification of the sometimes competing sometimes complementing masculine and feminine energies that reside within each of us regardless whether we are male or female
714741 if this interpretation is correct it says that the torah is a mystical or esoteric text
714742 the mystics have been saying all these years that the text conceals more than it reveals it is structured with different levels of meaning and reveals itself over time were talking about one tradition that goes all the way back
714743 marks unveiling is part of a mystic lineage that presents a prismatic experience of god that says there are ways of experiencing god that contain and explode categories simultaneously
714744 this god is not a male or even a female but a male female or female male a god that holds tension and paradox a full spectrum bandwidth god
714745 as post moderns weve been conditioned to a different relationship with language
714746 thats why there is all this interest now in jewish mysticism

714858 we saw this market develop in 2006 with quite a large number of guests from the middle east coming in over the summer this year we decided to support this market and provide all that they need to make their stay in hong kong an enjoyable stay
714859 hong kong has everything that london and new york offers designer shopping fabulous scenery world class services and superb sightseeing in a very safe environment its a big draw for families and business travellers alike he added

714863 claus levin sepstrup imponerede hans viden om emnet var fantastisk og vigtigst af alt han var entusiastisk og ekstremt overbevisende

714869 after all these years i cannot give you any excuse whatsoever
714870 it is just one of those things that occurred i have to some extent harmed you
714871 my inconvenient truth for al gore is you can save polar bears by going on a diet at least if its done nationwide
714872 hopefully it will increase public confidence in the work of lawyers
714873 at the moment theres no post graduate qualification we have students coming from different faculties of law madrassas islamic schools with different levels of competence and legal knowledge
714874 what this is going to do is create a common standard for all defence lawyers
714875 even if we make contact with prisoners afghan and foreign officials dont give us the time to meet them regularly
714876 in criminal cases it can be difficult because you have serious human rights issues women and children are considered property and basic due process rights are not necessarily respected
714877 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine
714878 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
714879 we crawled to the border that was our solution and i think we stayed at the border for two or three hours until the israeli army let the injured enter
714880 fatah officials in gaza should stay in their posts and should not leave gaza to hamas
714881 continue to hope even if we fight between each other or have differences
714882 will quickly discover it committed a very big act of stupidity
714883 hopefully it will increase public confidence in the work of lawyers
714884 at the moment theres no post graduate qualification we have students coming from different faculties of law madrassas islamic schools with different levels of competence and legal knowledge
714885 what this is going to do is create a common standard for all defence lawyers

714888 god let me pass on to her a positive attitude
714889 not recommended for people with dialup or metered broadband internet access emphasis mine
714890 that is just a taste of things to come especially if youre a fan of video services like hulu
714891 curiously representatives from other telecommunications companies praised the decision even though they objected to the commission meddling in how they manage their networks they said they would prefer such rulings to legislation from congress which has discussed enshrining net neutrality principles in the law
714892 a few people are using the lions share of our bandwidth were not allowed to block software like bittorrent used by these bandwidth hogs were not allowed to discriminate in any way so well have to charge by the megabyte instead so that costs will be fairly allocated and a few users dont spoil things for the rest of us it would be bad for our users to allow them to actually have unlimited internet access this plan doesnt discriminate against anyone
714893 we need policy to help cut a path for more competition rather than protecting incumbents a bandwidth competition act of 2008 not bogus net neutrality
714894 municipal or privately run wireless data services using wi fi or wimax should be sprouting like weeds
714895 a stroke of a pen can cure these ills incumbents be damned they will adjust i personally would climb telephone poles on my street to run fiber if i could get 100 megabit internet service any takers talk about an economic stimulus this is the type of infrastructure we need the stock market will fund it all as well as resolve overbuild problems
714896 and guess what the online video boom has taken its toll on the isp market as well with customers voting with their feet for better plans and as for all the metered packages that were all the rage just two or three years ago none of the big german isps are even advertising them anymore instead theyre trying to sell premium packages bundled with fast unmetered broadband access 1 amp 1 for example one of germanys biggest isps the company is now offering its customers a dsl package with 16mbit unlimited bandwidth and 100 movies on demand streamed to your pc for just 40 euros per month beats paying 30 per movie download doesnt it
714897 why do we have to choose between bush and gore when 200 years ago people chose between adams and jefferson
714898 this may seem humiliating to a man but the exemplar christian is a woman
714899 i dont give a fuck if i have the right or not now get me my fucking egg roll you paranoid twit

714906 para tomar las precauciones y las medidas necesarias necesitamos concertar las empresas los choferes que son los directamente responsables el ministerio de transportes y los gobiernos regionales que por ley y la constituci n tienen a su cargo las actividades de supervisi n de las carreteras en sus departamentos
714907 aunque despu s la tachen y la insulten como abusiva
714908 hay que poner un freno a esta suma de irresponsabilidades globales donde participan muchos actores y responsables y que no es solamente responsabilidad del ministerio o la ministra
714909 corresponde a cada chofer saber cu l es su l mite de trabajo y no ser irresponsable por su propia familia y la de sus pasajeros y corresponde a los gobiernos regionales actuar con m s efectividad

714920 although downside risks to growth remain they appear to have diminished somewhat and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased
714921 the problem is that people over interpreted greenspan because he never said very much
714922 with bernanke he generally says what he means and when you over interpret his comments you miss the target
714923 the fed reaffirmed in its statement that the rate cuts are over and that the next change will be up but i dont see any special urgency about how soon that rate increase will take place
714924 i think it is going to take that long for the economy to find its footing
714925 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighborhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
714926 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
714927 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
714928 we received 47 civilians who were injured in the blast and so far five have died in the hospital three of them women
714929 its the largest number of civilians we have received from one incident in weeks

714935 his energy could concentrate to a pitch of white hot steel leaving behind a trail of awesome ideas sometimes malformed conceived with brilliance but finally unsustainable
714936 the top five best selling classic novels of the year
714937 there weapons should be directed toward israel not toward each other
714938 weapons should not be used for palestinians to kill each other
714939 to direct their weapons against israel rather than against each other
714940 feuding groups should realize that the ordinary residents of ain al hilweh refuse to face the same agony as our compatriots at nahr al bared
714941 are completely aware of the tense security situation inside of their camp
714942 kids staged this demonstration to urge feuding groups to stop their skirmishes and more importantly to send out the message that they are worried about the fate of their camp
714943 in charge of sensitive files and closely linked to the syrian top brass
714944 right of the lebanese people army and resistance to liberate the israeli occupied shebaa farms kafar shuba hills and the lebanese section of al ghajar village and defend lebanon through using all legal and possible means
714945 adding this phrase is worthwhile as it will lead to achieving a general consensus over the policy statement of the new government
714946 most of the issues in the draft statement came in line with the principles of the march 14 forces
714947 as for the resistance it was only normal to spend much time discussing such a strategic issue and in the end we arrived at stressing the role and authority of lebanese state with respect to the conflict between lebanon and israel
714948 but i insist that adding the phrase under the guardianship of the state to paragraph 24 of the draft statement is necessary to reaffirm the role of the state
714949 what is mentioned in the introduction applies to all the statements chapters
714950 the lf will be reserved about any phrase which contradicts with its principles
714951 some people are still influenced by the 2005 elections which took place under specific circumstances which no longer exist
714952 in 2005 the christians voted the way they did for specific reasons but eventually their votes were trashed
714953 to tell the outside that the lebanese are not united over the issue of the resistance
714954 giving the state control over the resistance simply contradicts with the way the resistance functions
714955 the resistance was the result of the nature of the conflict with the israeli enemy in the light of the absence of the state in the past the relation between the resistance and the state should be that of understanding and cooperation the resistance is not ignoring the state and should not be viewed as a violation of its sovereignty
714956 some parties wanted the ministerial statement to speak about expelling the palestinians from lebanon this is not how the palestinians should be treated on the contrary they should given their civil rights
714957 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organization with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
714958 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organization including having ties with israel
714959 we see this as another trumped up charge against the bahais in order for the government to go through the motions of setting them up on charges and convicting them on charges
714960 a case has been filed whose defendants are two brothers they held conferences on such topics as aids which drew the attention of domestic and foreign organizations and ngos
714961 they would organize foreign trips for people and train them they were aware of what they were doing and their training was of the nature of a velvet revolution
714962 a security prosecution office is continuing to investigate the case
714963 around three to four months ago it became evident that both were involved with anti revolutionary groups outside iran and our investigations confirmed it
714964 because the international organization is committed to the principle that criminals should not enjoy immunity
714965 you shouldnt doubt my commitment to the culture of holding criminals accountable for their acts and you shouldnt doubt my commitment to the international tribunal for lebanon to try suspects in the 2005 assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri and related crimes
714966 yet to examine the full dossier concerning the international court
714967 failing to incarcerate criminals would reflect weakness and encourage perpetrators to pursue their criminal schemes
714968 poisoned the lives of the lebanese for a long time
714969 we will not rest until we reveal the truth behind those horrific assassinations
714970 still requires some more time and conditions to be established
714971 in order to prove that lebanon is a civilized country and that the lebanese are responsible people
714972 are likely to ensure that the tribunal wont be politicized
714973 to help the lebanese solve all pending issues and provide the framework for building a proper state
714974 hizbullah leader sayyed hassan nasrallahs recent call for dialogue among the lebanese in addition to syrian israeli talks are likely to appease tensions in lebanon and allow various groups to launch dialogue
714975 this means that at the end of the year the investigator will assume his new position as prosecutor for the international court
714976 i believe that bellmare now has something that will enable him to proceed to assume the position of prosecutor
714977 in order to reduce expenses and also to protect their lives
714978 energy fueled in ways that do not use up natural resources or harm the environment
714979 as such the amount of wind energy over land could potentially cover over five times the current global energy and about 40 times the current electricity uses with little incremental pollution
714980 satellite based studies by the german aerospace center dlr have shown that using less than 0 3 percent of the entire desert areas of the mena region solar thermal power plants can generate enough electricity and desalinated seawater to supply current demands in eu mena and anticipated increases in those demands in the future
714981 a center for solar energy research and hopefully over the next 30 to 50 years and will be a major megawatt exporter
714982 we shall also go on with the democratic process and start the elections on its date
714983 our position is firm there will be no cooperation with the so called international criminal court
714984 the correct position for the au therefore should be to investigate ourselves
714985 these colonial superpowers are waging a targeted campaign against our country
714986 the president of sudan is accused of being directly linked to genocide in darfur
714987 the mujahed sheikh and educator abu mohammad ibrahim bin abi al faraj al masri
714988 an expert may have gone but he has left behind thanks be to god experts whom he trained during years of giving patience and forbearance for the sake of right
714989 this is totally baseless the claim is rubbish there is no truth in this
714990 the younger generations of lebanese should avoid previous mistakes and work hard for the welfare of lebanon and to preserve their countrys unity
714991 all those who work on impeding the work of the newly formed cabinet
714992 some are using all possible means to obstruct a powerful start for the new government while the lebanese are plunging into more distress and despair
714993 common challenges facing the two countries in terms of dealing with terrorism and militancy
714994 decided that their respective foreign ministers will meet to prepare grounds for a framework for close and constructive engagement between the two countries to build confidence and develop a common strategy at the political military and intelligence levels
714995 the two sides agreed to coordinate their efforts to stop cross border terrorism
714996 compared to previous years their numbers have also decreased during the summer season due to the increase in sea turtles that approach the lebanese shores in order to reproduce they primarily feed on jellyfish
714997 fishermen believe that when jellyfish approach they bring with them schools of small and medium sized fish that use the jellyfish as shields from larger fish

715025 when i discovered that the recruiter would be paid 500 for my body i jumped in the freezing water and claimed the bounty myself
715026 i met a freed prisoner of andersonville he was coming home his farm was lost his family all dead damn it joe he was planning to live in a cave
715027 his family spent part of the year underground it was cool in the summer and warm in the winter
715028 if it gets any hotter id like to sleep in a cave
715029 doesnt a photographer live for the sunlight dont you and your brethren worship at the alter of helios or is it aten
715030 im partial to selene daughter of hyperion and theia my good work is under moonlight
715031 why such herculean efforts when the sun is waiting to serve you
715032 any fool can record an image as apollo drives his gleaming chariot across the sky it takes some ingenuity to capture the light hiding in the shadows
715033 the shadows of the deep caves will require much ingenuity i would presume
715034 for the eggs the albumen process requires lots of eggs
715035 the negatives and paper are treated to retain the images i cant rely on conventional techniques i have to create my own with possibility of endless variations
715036 its the only way i can expect to find the working formula everything is designed for the amplification of light im trying large medium and small apertures there are going to be times when i will use five or more cameras and every single lantern and candle that i have
715037 and you i take are something apart from flesh and blood
715038 i walk the earth like other men but i am connected into a transcendental circuitry that allows me to pursue my aims while helping others pursue theirs with virtually no additional effort i operate like a funicular railway
715039 imagine two small trains chained together one goes up the hill one goes down the hill gravity provides the fuel the only power needed is that which is lost to friction
715040 friction are the few coins that escape your own pocket
715041 yes young man that lose of transferable energy friction is when i have to pay for something myself
715042 there are those who need to know how practical how effective their inventions are before they invest heavily i test i report i suggest
715043 lafferty and associates a philadelphia legal and investment firm they work with inventors
715044 lucky for lafferty he found me at first i worked with one inventor directly he was a washington d c engineering professor he invented the greatest and worst lantern ever
715045 it operated on a unique principle allowed it to burn brighter than any other but was so complicated it hardly worked at all
715046 look at the sun for a moment then shut your eyes
715047 i dont understand how does this apply to a lantern
715048 no thats incidental to its purpose the purpose of a lantern is help a person see the room
715049 let suppose i had a lantern that could project a beam of light onto a wall the size of a marble the room is completely black except for that one spot
715050 yes i understand the room is dark expect in that half inch area
715051 now imagine that our lantern is attached to a ball bearing swivel it can easily project a beam along an arc
715052 you could move the beam of light back and forth
715053 yes i move the beam of light two inches to the left to position b now position b is lit but position a is now dark
715054 thats one hundred per cent true i can only light one area at a time imagine that i move the beam back to position a it visible but then i move it back to position b fast i keep on swiveling the light between these two positions what do i see
715055 position a then a moment later position b and so on
715056 no i see position a and position b at the same time what is lit and what you see is not the same
715057 the space between the two position do you see them as well
715058 a conventional lamp takes very bright small light a coal oil flame and radiates it to a much larger area any given point in a room lit but a conventional light would represent a small fraction of the brightness of the flame however the lamp issues the light constantly
715059 a single undiluted beam of light strikes a point in the room for a fraction of a second then moves to another point and then another and another
715060 that one beam of light is able to move so quickly that it can illuminate an entire room
715061 young joseph for the purpose of my explanation i have vastly over simplified the operation of the lamp it is constructed with many beams of light projecting from a cluster of small prisms there are two flames the top for light the one in the bottom chamber for heat which animates the carousel on top
715062 the light was powerful but so complex that it only operated under the best of conditions from the time that the wick was lit it took nearly an hour for the carousel achieve the speed necessary for the individual specs of light to merge into one continuous light the spinning could make you nauseous the only one i had shattered it happened on the night that the sultana sunk as i read the story about the assassination no lantern ever burned brighter no replacement never received
715063 youre going underground and youre going to make your own tin and coal oil sun have you shaken your fist and shouted at god lately
715064 are you going to live as this ex prisoner did summer and winter under spring and fall above
715065 im staging a photographic exhibit of the timmons cave of st louis at the mercantile library
715066 i was getting back to washington the sultana was overoverloaded with union army passengers coming home using the lantern i read to him and two or three hundred of the most desolate men god ever shook a fist at many from andersonville i knew that because i photographed them the days of liberation
715067 but not much else got through to them in the final hours of their incarceration the prisoners boarded the sultana ignorant of lincolns death
715068 was coming back to a cave i photographed men with nothing to go back to
715069 at two in the morning we turned into paddys hen and chickens islands for supplies
715070 the food badly stored was putrid and rotten the soldiers were hungry after waiting 15 minutes in the fog a one legged rowboat man hobbled on boarded in a hoarse sickly voice he yelled can anyone read a telegram i couldnt tell whether he couldnt read at all or his voice wasnt strong to read aloud i pushed aside cotton bales and hay to grabbed it i used the light from a sleeping mans lantern i read it aloud notice to all americans i shouted as loud as i could getting the attention of a few stragglers still asleep gods wrath has taken vengeance upon evil the murderer of beloved abraham lincoln has been shot praise the lord that john wilkes booth is burning in hell armageddon erupted while these words were still hanging in the air
715071 it wasnt fist against flesh the gas of hell ruptured two inch thick pennsylvania cast iron
715072 it was three boilers tons of pressurized steam hotter than the lava of krakatau burst with dragon fury first one explosion followed by two louder blasts sounding like a keg of detonated nitroglycerin saturated in hideous flames the boards of the wooded deck splintered into the night sky like clusters of chinese fireworks the flames singeing thier skin like a blast furnace forced hundreds of men into the frigid water their agonizing screams still echo on the uneasy and rippling surface of the mississippi
715073 the filthy liars claim only 1 500 men died that night
715074 of course they are not too eager to admit that it was dangerously overbooked
715075 with the surrender of lee and the assassination of the president there was hardly a mention of it
715076 besides you cant trust newspapers to look out for the victims the dead dont buy advertising but shipping lines do
715077 it was americans deadliest naval disaster and it you hadnt been there you wouldnt have know it happened
715078 now that your dreams of military glory are dimmer what do you plan to do with yourself
715079 you should meet james lafferty he crossed the atlantic in 51 with the job of a junior partner in patent a firm he walked in as the senior partner
715080 he told the secretary that she had emerald eyes that was that
715081 some might say they were green others could have said hazel sage or kelly he said emerald after that she was the secretary with emerald eyes but of course he had the authority
715082 this is all that remains of the circus with the red silk tent dont let pirates have it
715083 young joseph as you can see an expedition even off the river can run into a snag
715084 mere mortals on and off the river are snag prone
715085 be my guest for lunch i have some business i want to discuss with you
715086 dat screamn and hollering its satan yelln to souls hes tryn to git
715087 said one of the porters as he mounted his burro
715088 yell all he want satan mrs satans cookn is just going to have to get cold i aint getn any closer ill eat jerky and stale bread
715089 its a magnificent flute the changing relative temperatures move the air through the catacombs if you listen carefully you can tell that there are several distinct sounds the air striking and bouncing off various surfaces creates vibrations that will yield different sounds depending on the passageways
715090 id go in there but without any light i cant see anything what good it do
715091 one farmer had a chicken live all summer without a head
715092 at the carnival the contortionist owned a big fat chicken no head too that went on that way for over a year she forced slop down its throat to keep it alive
715093 what are you proposing to do about our immediate headless wonder
715094 young joseph this is not what i am paying you for you are to help with the experiments keep records write letters based on our research not foolishly lose your life for a chicken
715095 ill use these thick branches tipped in kerosene i should be able to see well enough
715096 luther do you have any more advice that you want to give young joseph
715097 if you have some more splendid ideas on how pulitzer can do your job better this is the time to speak
715098 may not be your calling but you are a fine medic i dont think that galen or hippocrates could have done better
715099 i did it in the carnival i fixed up the fire eater horses even an elephant
715100 luther any mummy wrapper would be impressed with your skills i bet we could just toss young joseph back in the cave and hed be preserved for a thousand years
715101 after i have helped you with your initial preparations i am going to continue with my original plan
715102 joseph of course you cant retreat with the first unpleasantness
715103 unpleasantness is the sound of a soprano who reaches for notes that exceed her abilities a sausage that is too spicy or pants that are so tight that they constrict breathing
715104 i will find an appropriate place for it in my notebook of cherished wisdom
715105 who can tell about these kinds of things i might come to my senses one day perhaps when i shave off my beard i will look at the scars of my disfigured face and with a thunderous epiphany decide that my destiny is to decorate spiny rocks in caves with my blood and sharpen the claws of flying vermin with my face
715106 it will pay enough for a couple of meals and a bed be patient young man i have a feeling that more work is coming much more
715107 same pay you are going to do quite well for yourself young man
715108 i know you we met a few days ago you worked for a photographer name whilely
715109 remember you ran after the chicken when your son dropped the case
715110 why not maybe that same chicken brought the disease to my son
715111 a new orleans doctor from the boat looked at him just after you and mr whiley left doctor said he had treated several cases with similar symptoms in cape girardeau and blytheville they all died my son he died the yesterday last year the floods came to many cities along the river this year what came was even worse
715112 i dont mean any disrespect young man but you say your name like its suppose to mean something
715113 no no apologies i wasnt critical i was curious it was as if i had heard your name in some kind of context apart from this experience today as if i had heard it in the future when you work in a cemetery for as many years as i have you cant help get strange feelings with people dieing and their family mourning folks say that i have a special sense an intuition about things that are coming
715114 the st louis wharves are the mississippis cornucopia of excess it brings to us more good and evil than any city deserves
715115 mr pulitzer you should have seen them stalactites 20 foot tall rock tears they hung from the ceiling of a stone cathedral like pipes from the almightys organ we didnt find no devil in there it had to be gods work
715116 mr whileys exhibition isnt it supposed to start today all that work all that planning hell have nothing to show for it
715117 dont you know about the epidemic the plague is eating the city like locust what difference does it make a few photographs on a wall when the apocalypse is rearing over the like a black horse of death look around
715118 see all the smoke its not coming from chimneys to make hot coffee and biscuits block after block theyre burning homes of the dead
715119 ive buried enough men and children to know how serious it is
715120 in all of the time that we were there there was only moment that he was happy he found one of the lanterns called the jordan 7 it was made from sharply cut glass like an ostrich egg sized diamond
715121 when youre in the caves and the wind howls and the bats flutter a beacons bright light floods fear
715122 he took a thousand exposures he didnt sleep he was obsessed kerosene fumed all the time six or seven of the lanterns broke glass shattered under the heat there were spills and small fires all of the time sometimes with the photographic chemicals and the smell of the kerosene you couldnt breathe at least i couldnt breathe none of the pictures were quite good enough
715123 most were never finished the chemicals werent given the chance to finish too fuzzy bad focus he said to the ones that were finished they were burned in the campfire every night
715124 he probably didnt want anyone to see his work that wasnt perfect
715125 youre right he wouldnt let me see anything me what do i know about photography
715126 there are a couple of things i should tell you
715127 one photograph survived it was the first one it dried in the cave on a ledge by the stream when the fire broke out i had to move a lot of materials i shoved it inside the case to protect it hot wax from a candle streamed on it making tight seal i havent looked at i dont want to im not going to
715128 he didnt want me to see the photographs until they were right
715129 he did it the first day in the cave when you left he exposed it for seven hours he said that with such a small aperture i think thats the word he used aperture the detail is going to be sharp
715130 he couldnt eat the chickens we roasted when the cholera took him he just drank the cave water
715131 just looking at the feathers disgusted him once the wind blew a basket of feathers into the cave and he cried he cried joseph this is a man that i work for he paid me a couple bits day and i had to watch him cry and watch him die
715132 every day i kept on saying to myself how smart you were to escape
715133 i dont know what good it will do to tell you
715134 he was very sick toward the end he was just
715135 he said that if you kept your word his photographs would be hanging in the library like god intended them to be
715136 i dont want to tell you this because its not right
715137 prayed to god to make your future as black as the caves and
715138 this is not a day to talk about cholera today we celebrate chess
715139 ill wait on that couch wake me when hes back
715140 a man died for this library i am here to redeem that honor
715141 yes yes of course that andersonville photographer he works for matthew brady my word he died
715142 he came to st louis to create a photographic exhibition of the timmons cave he was killed by cholera pursuing this quest today i buried him in blackamore cemetery
715143 mr pulitzer im just the secretary you will really need to speak to the librarian mr hitchcock
715144 you can speak to mr hitchcock for just a couple of minutes
715145 a man is measured by his intriguing en passant his facility with the fianchetto and deft discovery of that middle ground that lies between wise protection of the king and the cowardliness of prophylaxis
715146 it is the players fierce drive to conquer and occasionally show mercy that establishes his merit not his clothes and never should his clothes be harshly judged when they are the tools he employs to come to his citys defense in its hour of greatest peril
715147 an impressive title for such a young man from what land did you obtain this distinction
715148 to avoid the wrath of my rooks the white pawns scattered like roaches
715149 not as much as i had hoped but less than i had depended on
715150 what is the immediate objective of attila the rook are you here to enjoy our refreshments and sharpen your skills on the board
715151 as beneficial as that may be im on a mission on behalf of a fallen soldier
715152 gentlemen fellow chess players this young man is here because of the andersonville photographer carmen thomas whiley he died today
715153 i think that i should read a letter that i received today from james vincent di paul lafferty of lafferty and associates of philadelphia dear mr hitchcock and the honorable board of directors of the st louis mercantile library
715154 gentleman i know that you have come here for chess and not palace intrigue but this matter should only take a few minutes
715155 mr hitchcock i think that i can speak for my fellow chess players when i say we are always interested in a little palace intrigue
715156 lafferty continues to say enclosed you will find a check payable at the first national bank of st
715157 with your permission i would like to share on observation
715158 my name is carl schurz i publish a german language daily newspaper called the westliche post may i know your name
715159 although i am known as attila the rock in chess circles my family name is pulitzer i am joseph pulitzer of budapest
715160 young man i knew a philip pulitzer but he was from mak any possible relation after all pulitzer is an unusual name
715161 this is very interesting indeed maybe you can tell me my wife says that philip had extraordinary powers she used to tell young children in the kindergarten in new york that your father could make it rain could change the arrival of trains and even the nutrients in the soil
715162 margarethe my wife was given to fanciful stories i always told the children his success came from his diligence to improving himself and showing kindness to others
715163 which did you inherit from you father supernatural powers or diligence
715164 perhaps this portion of your questions can be delayed we are here to discuss the business at hand
715165 forgive me mr hitchcock and honored guest the relevant observation is that i see the development of an interesting dilemma
715166 quite simply mr pulitzer suggests that he has knowledge of the exact location of the lanterns why we speaking as a member of the board of the mercantile library control the funds
715167 if there was some way that the board could have some assurances that you did posses the information you claim
715168 please this will just take a moment i am here only for the purpose of redemption any possible financial reward for my unintentional involvement in what has to be considered a crime was completely unexpected and unrequired it may be a shock to esteemed gentlemen here such as yourself that someone who sleeps in a shed and wears rags does not snip at a possible easy fortune like a mute who has seen meat fall off a wagon i am now in that most peculiar of predicaments the very item that i have come here to deliver for redemption could very well be that assurance or proof that you require
715169 at my young age i cannot tell my fate nor do any of you know yours what i can say is that if i hand over this valise i will complete my mission if on the way out i stop off at your secretarys office and draw a map with detailed instructions on how to recover the lanterns then i believe that no one in this room has any rights or justifications for asking assurances of me
715170 im sure you will agree that we have been more than patient with this intrigue
715171 yes of course joseph pulitzer has agreed to provide the instructions on how to reclaim the lanterns apparently he is asking nothing which is more mr hitchcock than you require of my patience the mercantile library stands to make a handsome profit for gods sake is this matter not yet closed
715172 that chess is something more than moving carved wooden pieces around a black and white board were it not we could just as well play jackstraws tiddly winks or for that matter even checkers
715173 chess teaches us a myriad of subtle lessons many of them seemingly contradictory pawns the lowest of the social order are sacrificed so that their betters can advance yet it is only the pawn through diligent persistent effort who finally succeeds to the enemys nest can transform himself from the weakest to the most powerful as a queen let us set aside the virtues of strategy tactics and cunning lets focus on the lessons of chivalry and what is chivalry
715174 i could not disagree with your definitions gentlemen however i think that it is something more specific it is the deliberate fidelity to a personal code of honor
715175 is there a code of honor to which this discussion is relevant
715176 is it not the purpose of this institution to foster the economic success of st louis and it inhabitants
715177 having read many of your editorials i can approximate where i think you are headed in less time
715178 the library is violating its own ethical code by not sharing the reward with mr pulitzer
715179 i will provide instructions to the secretary but i am leaving as i came
715180 your rook is in danger sacrifice your queen shes the only one thats replaceable
715181 gentlemen st louis is at the mercy of men who can mobilize thought and action
715182 send lafferty his lanterns and this telegram lanterns are on next available train stop keep the money stop we need something more valuable stop immediately drop your pen and come to st louis to mobilize our men against the plague stop
715183 that has this and that and definitely not good for you
715184 we are serious in talks and we want the talks to be based on the law so it will bear practical results we hope that other sides are serious too
715185 will not give up an inch on its nuclear rights
715186 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
715187 when we were in france we told them about the syrian position on irans nuclear issue but they asked us if we have details of the iranian program
715188 on this trip we got details so in the future if we are asked again we know irans position
715189 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
715190 they leave the un security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
715191 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks and this is a clear message to the international community to continue with real and effective sanctions
715192 the international community is being watched not only by iran but also by irans neighbors and when the international community shows hesitation it is perceived as weakness
715193 we live in a neighborhood in which you either beat the bully or join it
715194 we need to understand that we need to act today in terms of sanctions sanctions can be effective as long as the iranians and the entire world understand that all the options are on the table this is what we need to do today
715195 her job was to carry out recruitment brainwash new recruits and then push them to carry out criminal activities
715196 the car bomb attack took place early sunday and was aimed at the city security forces in tizi ouzou leaving 25 wounded including four police officers
715197 four civilians among the wounded are under medical treatment and a policeman requires minor surgery
715198 that allows people in similar struggles to relate my experience to their own and maybe use whats of benefit to them
715199 conflict resolution success processes have common threads inclusivity representation and equality
715200 everyone has to see and treat everyone with equal respect you cannot have a framework of resolving conflict based entirely on your terms you have to have a mutual understanding of everyones views
715201 the key to the process in the north of ireland was people could see that politics were working ability to deliver is meaningless if youre faced with a political vacuum things had to be achieved and aims have to be realized to keep people on board the political process has to deliver meaningful change otherwise the ability to deliver people counts for nothing
715202 when it comes to the middle east conflict the arabs no longer see any difference between republicans and democrats
715203 both parties vie with one another in expressing total support for israel
715204 we are the most natural of allies and like israel itself that alliance is for ever
715205 remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
715206 im here to reaffirm the special relationship between israel and the us and my abiding commitment to israels security
715207 obama paid his respects to dozens of israeli victims in sderot while neglecting to mention the thousands of recent palestinian victims of israeli violence
715208 how can anyone expect him to be even handed on the issue when he becomes president
715209 is not exclusive to the republicans but permeates both political parties
715210 when it comes to israel theres virtually no difference in republican and democratic party policies
715211 the democratic administration of former us president bill clinton for example consisted of even more jewish zionists including the defense secretary william cohen the secretary of state madeleine albright and the national security adviser samuel berger than the current republican bush administration
715212 these people occupy most of the top political and military positions throughout the american political system
715213 anyone who thinks washington can serve as a fair mediator in the israel palestine conflict under republicans or democrats is delusional
715214 securing israels presence in the middle east the return of the jews to israel and the eventual construction of the jewish temple on the site where the al aqsa mosque now stands
715215 they have used us military force to spread their version of democracy which excludes all forms of political islam be it lebanons hizbullah hamas in palestine or the egyptian muslim brotherhood
715216 these people have a greater attachment to israel and world zionism than they do to the us
715217 but they have tried hard to convince the american public that us and israeli interests are one and the same
715218 the zionist lobby can make or break any would be presidential candidate
715219 this isnt due to its large voting numbers but to its enormous influence on the media both in the us and in western europe
715220 since then neoconservative elements have bought up many important american media institutions including major news outlets
715221 this along with the establishment of numerous research centers and think tanks has been their primary means of promoting the neoconservative agenda in the us
715222 a coalition service member was killed and another wounded when their convoy struck an ied improvised explosive device this morning in kabul
715223 the effect on the overall growth rate wont be as much as they are forecasting
715224 dont forget that a larger number of our firms are suffering from many more problems
715225 should respect the laws and policies of their host countries and know that the fight against israel should take place in lebanon and not anywhere else
715226 our brother emigrants should be aware that they are not supposed to be fighting israel in their host countries especially that these countries are not occupied by israel
715227 it is your right to respect the resistance and to preserve the sovereignty and independence of your country we truly appreciate that
715228 there is no need to fear hizbullah and the resistance which liberated the land and the detainees
715229 the lebanese the army and the resistance have the right to liberate or the occupied shebaa farms and the kfar shouba hills
715230 this is a clear declaration that lebanon is keen on maintaining the source of its force
715231 when dialogue sessions will be held later on we will discuss the defense strategy and how to benefit from all our potentials and capacities
715232 it is grossly misleading to say that the resistance is the problem in lebanon and that we want to discuss its status

715238 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if found to be guilty they will be brought to justice those proven innocent will be released
715239 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
715240 yesterday evening abu mazen abbas and palestinian premier salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
715241 shortly afterward israeli defense minister ehud barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to the gaza strip
715242 dialogue is important we have called for it egypt has agreed to invite palestinian factions to meet in cairo
715243 we cant lose hope we disagree and fight but we have to work together to bridge the big gap created unfortunately by hamas
715244 continued factional infighting harms the palestinian cause and threatens efforts to help establish an independent palestinian state

715295 i have been asked this question very often and my usual answer is that you tell me where the oil prices will go in near term and then i will give the inflation figure
715296 what i can definitely tell you is that in the next 12 months the inflation will come down to normal levels of five to six per cent
715297 this could be an exceptionally bad year but over a period of time we will achieve the targeted growth of nine per cent

715318 in order to look like a man you will wear nothing except the skin of an animal you killed with your bare hands
715319 a man is never wrong if you disagree with this you are wrong
715320 you may occasionally state i dont know to avoid being wrong this should be avoided when possible and should when necessary be replaced by only a rugged grunt

715327 we are not going to speculate or jump to conclusions until we have gathered all the evidence
715328 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult
715329 we would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks and successful outcome so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy
715330 it is the worst tragedy on k2 since 1986 when 12 climbers were killed due to exposure
715331 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain i panicked when a pakistani high altitude carrier fell straight onto my back with his entire weight
715332 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
715333 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
715334 at present it is believed that anyone who is classified as position unknown will not be coming back
715335 the lower they come to the ground the closer they are to safety but they are totally exhausted and not out of danger yet
715336 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
715337 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
715338 we will not only host a quality and unique games but build a more scenic greener and more civilised city in a sustainable manner
715339 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
715340 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
715341 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
715342 a lot of the dead are women and children and elderly people people thought there would be a landslide and the stampede started and that was when people were crushed to death
715343 some of the bodies were taken home straight away by relatives and some were taken to the doctor and could have perished then but there are around 125 to 150 dead people
715344 a lot of people were confined in a small area
715345 at least 15 militants were killed and many injured in an exchange of fire with security forces near sij bund in matta district
715346 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
715347 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
715348 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
715349 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
715350 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
715351 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
715352 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
715353 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
715354 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
715355 i have no interest in being a martyr im just trying to be a good bishop
715356 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
715357 to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
715358 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
715359 we deeply appreciate and value senator obamas perspective on this important issue
715360 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24th as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

715368 the skulls are often claimed to exhibit paranormal phenomena by some members of the new age movement and have often been portrayed as such in fiction
715369 anna hedges claimed that she found the skull buried under a collapsed altar inside a temple in lubaantun in british honduras now belize as far as can be ascertained f a mitchell hedges himself made no mention of the alleged discovery in any of his writings on lubaantun also others present at the time of the excavation have not been documented as noting either the skulls discovery or annas presence at the dig
715370 we can well perceive how the whole human race is encompassed with great with incalculable afflictions we see it languishing on its bed of sickness sore tried and disillusioned they that are intoxicated by self conceit have interposed themselves between it and the divine and infallible physician witness how they have entangled all men themselves included in the mesh of their devices they can neither discover the cause of the disease nor have they any knowledge of the remedy they have conceived the straight to be crooked and have imagined their friend an enemy
715371 that which god hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal cause one common faith
715372 in the past there have been creeds such for example as the belief in magic or divination which have been very widely accepted but we now know them to have been quite absurdly false yet they have exerted the very greatest influence on human history the species homo has not changed and there are still very many who are only too eager to believe in such things not by any means all of them confined to the less advanced civilizations and it must be expected that this tendency will continue to recur again and again

715376 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
715377 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
715378 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
715379 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you

715413 in theology endless mistakes result from supposing that the conditions bounds and limits of our finite existence apply to god the doctrine of his aseity meaning that god has life in himself and draws his unending energy from himself stands as a bulwark against such mistakes in our life of faith we easily impoverish ourselves by embracing an idea of god that is too limited and small and again the doctrine of gods aseity stands as a bulwark to stop this happening it is vital for spiritual health to believe that god is great cf ps 95 1 7 and grasping the truth of his aseity is the first step on the road to doing this

715480 mas s esteve entre os titulares por uma circunst ncia
715481 ainda vamos ver o que melhor para a equipe mas o resultado positivo d uma tranq ilidade para usarmos esses jogadores tudo ser definido durante os treinos da semana
715482 n s est vamos jogando dentro da proposta diminuindo os espa os do goi s mas tivemos um erro no fim do primeiro tempo e tomamos um gol bobo isso acabou com a nossa id ia inicial
715483 n s tivemos de sair um pouco mais no segundo tempo e o goi s soube aproveitar eles tiveram muita velocidade nos contragolpes e n s erramos demais na frente
715484 a corrida come ou bem a tudo foi para o inferno no primeiro pit stop uma vez que os rapazes precisaram usar um extintor de inc ndio
715485 aconteceu de novo na segunda parada e fiquei com espuma dentro e fora do meu visor sem conseguir ver nada a tive que fazer outra parada para limp lo
715486 n o encontramos a verdadeira causa do incidente mas tem uma grande possibilidade de pneu furado
715487 n o conseguimos analisar a rea apontada porque ele correu meia volta com um pneu dianteiro rebaixado e os lados estavam bastante danificados portanto a possibilidade de um corte lateral
715488 quando h marcas de murchamento isto significa que h uma rea pr xima do ch o portanto poss vel que uma pedra afiada tenha tocado a parte lateral do pneu o que mostra que pode ter havido um furo
715489 claro que pelos resultados que o jadel j conquistou o foco fica mais para ele mas n o me sinto exclu do estou chegando aos poucos conquistando meu espa o vamos ver se consigo ser a zebra dessa olimp ada
715490 eu n o penso muito nisso at porque o melhor salto do jadel 17 90 m que ele fez no ano passado
715491 acho que a partir de 17 40 m um saltador pode pensar em medalhas estou trabalhando para isso
715492 n o encontramos uma causa certa mas alta a possibilidade de detritos
715493 tivemos dois lados neste final de semana primeiro uma boa in cio e depois os problemas na classifica o a corrida tamb m come ou bem eu tinha um desempenho bom ent o teve a adversidade do pitstop que se repetiu na segunda parada
715494 estava jogando torneios na europa e realmente senti que estava um n vel um pouco acima das outras mas hoje era uma final e estava um pouco nervosa
715495 faltava um pouco de confian a para mim e agora com esse t tulo vou para os torneios mais tranquila
715496 comecei um pouco nervoso a partida mas consegui me concentrar para fazer um bom primeiro set e a ganhei confian a nicolas n o jogou t o bem hoje e fui mais feliz nos pontos importantes estou muito contente pelo t tulo principalmente porque ele aconteceu contra um tenista t o experiente
715497 foi uma corrida dif cil j que brigamos muito est vamos muito pesados no in cio da corrida mas o ritmo n o estava t o ruim e pude me manter com os outros minha frente
715498 na verdade as duas williams estavam apenas duas voltas mais pesadas do que eu quando eu estava atr s delas por m eu mantive o mesmo ritmo mesmo no final da corrida nas ltimas voltas eu pude virar 1min22s6 o que um bom tempo de volta
715499 considero um bom final de semana com este sexto lugar e o p dio de ontem
715500 larguei bem e ganhei uma posi o ainda na segunda volta j passei outro carro e fiquei em sexto

715510 what can you say about the cre transaction slowdown this article points out
715511 the number of sales are definitely slowing down for a couple of reasons the credit markets are making it difficult to obtain financing many pending sales are taking 2 to 3 times longer to close as well lenders are being far more conservative in their underwriting which is resulting in lower ltvs the cost of capital is increasing as lenders increase their spreads and up front costs and this all results to higher costs for investors and therefore lower return on their investment
715512 so the costs are up and returns are down how does that affect the behavior of the sellers and buyers
715513 well that creates a spread between bid and ask price for commercial properties in this new environment sellers are asking too much for their properties and buyers are offering less than before many sellers are realizing they cant get the prices they might have 18 months ago and that now may not be a good time to sell and many of the buyers that were in the market 18 months ago are out the 1031 buyers for example so we are seeing less transactions taking place
715514 what do you see with regards to sales volumes looking forward
715515 i think the slowdown is temporary credit markets will come back to more normal conditions and it will gradually become easier to secure financing sellers will eventually come back down to earth over the the rest of this year and in to 2009 we will continue to see slower sales volumes than in the past in the meantime there will still be a small number of distressed sellers who have to sell and will do so at depressed prices a lot of the people we are seeing sell now are in trouble
715516 what tips would you give our students who are eager to buy

715703 jack white has cast doubt over whether his band the white stripes will ever play live again
715704 i guess its up to meg the beatles did it quite touring but continued as a band im joking but if we didnt ever tour again it wouldnt matter to me
715705 there are so many different aspects to being creative that it doesnt matter if one component is changed its been changing all the time since the band started
715706 if something touring isnt working for you and its detrimental to you then you have to figure out a new way to attack it a new way to look at it i think thats what megs doing

715712 my thoughts are with the mcdonnell family as they come to terms with their great loss following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country at gerard becoming the first irish person to scale k2 it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother
715713 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
715714 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
715715 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
715716 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states

715718 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
715719 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
715720 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
715721 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
715722 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process

715737 his mother had no job no pension no husband so from a young age ratko had to fight to survive
715738 but he was strong he could swim faster than anyone dive deeper run faster throw stones over his shoulder farther than anyone he is stubborn determined and never gives up if there is a world under the sea then he is hiding there
715739 he is the one with the most blood on his hands
715740 radovan is an exhibitionist a poet intellectual who likes to show off but ratko is understated and extremely disciplined
715741 he has many friends in the military who are deeply loyal to him i think he would kill himself before he would turn himself in he has too much dignity to be captured
715742 i have supported hundreds of pieces of legislation which would help americans obtain an equal opportunity in america i am proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of dr martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination in any shape or form in america today
715743 in arizona a bill to recognize a holiday honoring mlk failed in the legislature so then gov bruce babbitt a democrat declared one through executive order in january 1987 the first act of arizonas new governor republican evan mecham was to rescind the executive order by his predecessor to create an mlk holiday arizonas stance became a national controversy mccain backed the decision at the time
715744 in a vote likely to haunt him for the rest of his public career mccain voted against 1983 legislation establishing the third monday in january as the federal holiday marking kings birthday back home in arizona he supported gov evan mechams decision in 1987 to rescind an executive order creating a state holiday for king but later reversed his position
715745 i believe that barry goldwater to start with regretted his vote on the 1964 civil rights act
715746 i think that barry grew like all of us grow and evolve in 1983 when i was brand new in the congress i voted against the recognition of dr martin luther king that was a mistake ok and later i had the chance to help fight for the recognition of dr martin luther king as a holiday in my state
715747 to prohibit federal financing for the martin luther king jr federal holiday commission
715748 civil rights act of 1990 is designed to overturn several recent supreme court rulings that made it much more difficult for individual employees to prove discrimination the legislation being fought by business also would impose new penalties on employers convicted of job discrimination

715862 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people

715879 an earthquake of the magnitude of 9 11 can shift the tectonic plates of international politics
715880 thats as much an accident of personalities as anything else
715881 we used to have strong arguments and many differences of perspective but they were all kept inside the administration the president decided and that was it so its partly a question of how conflict is handled its more public now
715882 must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role
715883 we should expect future coalitions to be ad hoc assemblies often not lasting beyond the crisis being confronted
715884 there is an international community that can be led by the only real power left in the world and that is the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along
715885 for america this is a time of unrivaled military power economic promise and cultural influence
715886 our vision is that no great power or coalition of powers dominates or endangers our friends
715887 when i was coming up with what was a dangerous world
715888 we knew exactly who the they were it was us versus them and it was clear who the them were today were not so sure who the they are but we know theyre there
715889 many wondered what new direction our foreign policy would take we spoke as always of long term problems and regional crises throughout the world but there was no single immediate global threat that any roomful of experts could agree upon
715890 all of that changed five months ago the threat is known and our role is clear now
715891 cannot know today whether russia or for that matter china will be neutral friend foe or part of a hostile alliance in the future
715892 it cannot therefore be sensible now to codify the character and quantity of us strategic nuclear forces to some approximation of parity in us and russian strategic nuclear force structures
715893 where the united states may face multiple potential opponents but were not sure who they might be
715894 in the event that us relations with russia significantly worsen in the future the us may need to revive its nuclear force levels and posture
715895 we were surprised on september 11 and let there be no doubt we will be surprised again
715896 is to defend our nation against the unknown the uncertain the unseen and the unexpected
715897 our friends and allies in the middle east and europe
715898 the driving force of middle east politics including on such important matters as the middle east peace process
715899 yasir arafat was forced to make peace once radical alternatives he could turn to like iraq had disappeared
715900 the containment of iraq is failing the united states needs to accelerate saddams demise if it truly wants to help the peace process
715901 the road that leads to real security and peace the road runs through baghdad
715902 turn the whole region into a cauldron and thus destroy the war on terrorism
715903 to try to help those trying to understand the problems we face with iraq and the options available to the united states
715904 a potentially costly war now or a far worse war in the near future
715905 all of the arguments in favor of deterrence are flawed in that they overstate the certainty that any leader in possession of nuclear weapons can be deterred at all times
715906 the unique threat posed by saddam hussein the serial aggressor and mass murderer and his pursuit of nuclear weapons
715907 we rightly devoted all of the united states diplomatic intelligence and military attention to eradicating the threat from and as long as that remains the case we should not indulge in a distraction as great as toppling saddam
715908 the united states has agreed to discuss any material breach of iraqs obligations with the security council but without jeopardizing our freedom of action to defend our country
715909 the councils unified stand maximizes the possibility admittedly slim that iraq can be disarmed without war
715910 if somehow iraq were able to acquire sufficient nuclear material from foreign sources it could probably produce nuclear weapons on short order perhaps in a matter of months

715931 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise u s interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling
715932 im where im at because i made an adolescent choice
715933 this is not about vengeance this is not about a deterrent or about closure its about the punishment
715934 everybody wants me to say closure or vengeance im never going to have closure its just a miracle word thats going to make us feel good but it aint going to happen
715935 the law is clear texas is bound not by the world court but by the u s supreme court which reviewed this matter and determined that this convicted murderers execution shall proceed
715936 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
715937 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
715938 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
715939 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
715940 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
715941 i am theresa a catholic mom of 5 wife of incredibly supportive husband ed currently having a blast homeschooling superboy 12 and jbug 6 in beautiful fairbanks alaska

715943 en esta misma lavander a otras personas que no ten an la apariencia de ser hispanas no fueron registradas por los agentes
715944 uno de ellos el guatemalteco magnolio s lo estaba doblando su ropa luego de haberla lavado y los agentes entraron a la lavander a sin tener ning n permiso para hacerlo este es un espacio privado y necesitan permiso para hacerlo
715945 el d a que detuvieron a mi marido recib una llamada y un agente del border patrol patrulla fronteriza burl ndose me dijo si quer a ir a acompa ar a mi esposo a la c rcel centro de detenci n
715946 yo le respond d jese de burlarse y p seme a mi marido sent mucho miedo pero lo que m s tristeza me da es que ya han pasado casi tres semanas sin verlo
715947 mcnamara expresses no regret for his greater wrong failing to speak the truth then when it mattered
715948 a major national disaster surely has a higher obligation to the country than to the president
715949 the united states is involved in a war in vietnam american troops will stay until victory
715950 actually the united states has been deeply involved in the fate of vietnam since 1949 when the decision was made to subsidize the continuation of french rule against the communist viet minh rebellion
715951 theres no question the oplan 34 a covert operations had a bearing on it
715952 our navy was not associated with was not aware of any south vietnamese actions if there were any i say this flatly this is a fact
715953 there have been some covert operations in that area that we have been carrying on so i imagine they wanted to put a stop to it
715954 the pentagon had envisaged since january 1964 that south vietnamese covert operations against the north could lead to enemy retaliation and hence to american bombing of the north
715955 deliberately lied in order to make the north vietnamese action as provocative as possible
715956 appear to have played a key role in hanois decision to attack the maddox the ongoing desoto naval patrols also likely contributed to that decision
715957 mr secretary i hear what you are saying but its not going to work it wont work in this north vietnamese kind of society
715958 denied areas were too difficult to penetrate it was a staggering concession
715959 there has never been an official of deputy assistant secretary rank or higher including myself who could have passed in office a midterm freshman exam in modern vietnamese history if such a course existed in this country
715960 thereby defusing at least for the moment a crisis in kosovo that might well have led to military intervention by one or more western powers
715961 we understand better now that the us understands very little about vietnam even now in this conference the us understands very little
715962 why bother the time has passed even if in the end we all agree on something what difference will it make it will make no difference i have finished
715963 but really your bullets are the killers of our people we see that this is americas gift to vietnam allowing the french to kill our people so how can we conclude that you are not our enemy but please try to understand me when i say
715964 i am beginning to think that not only did we not understand each other im beginning to think that we did not want to understand each other
715965 as for our reaction the psychology of our reaction all of these points all of these proposals all of these initiatives all of these intermediaries all of these efforts foundered and could not be taken with total seriousness because of the bombing
715966 maybe it was a tragedy for you you wanted to replace the french you failed men died so yes it was tragic because they died for a bad cause but for us the war was a noble sacrifice so i agree that you missed opportunities and that you need to draw lessons but us i think we would do nothing different under the circumstances
715967 a movement of the back of his hand across his face as one would discourage a pesky gnat
715968 the actual relationship between north vietnams government and the southern revolution was both more complex and more direct than westerners like to believe more complex than johnson and the now departed richard nixon thought and more direct than many antiwar figures believed
715969 the time has come to push the armed struggle against the enemy
715970 we had to watch the nlf carefully in those days we were not sure what they would say on one day that we had to undo the next
715971 we always believed there would be a place for us in a new government of reconciliation
715972 we attacked on too large a front and seeing enemies everywhere resorted to terror worse still torture came to be regarded as normal practice
715973 leaders in washington in supporting a despot betrayed their own stated principles in the name of fighting communism
715974 the fundamental enemy the root cause of the agony over the vietnam war was mutual ignorance the inability of washington and hanoi to penetrate the outlook of the other side
715975 american ignorance of the history language and culture of vietnam
715976 at no point during the long 1964 were american leaders hemmed in on vietnam they always possessed real choice neither domestic nor international considerations compelled them to escalate the war
715977 has hanoi shown any serious interest in negotiations yes repeatedly
715978 the same thing could never have been said of the united states
715979 american policymakers from mid 1963 onward were not merely skeptical of the possibility of finding an early political solution to the war but acutely fearful of such a prospect and strongly determined to prevent one
715980 the stakes in preserving an anti communist south vietnam are so high that in our judgment we must go on bending every effort to win
715981 it would demonstrate that the us was a good doctor willing to keep promises be tough take risks get bloodied and hurt the enemy badly
715982 ball always talked tough on the war tougher than almost anyone else
715983 by all accounts george ball treasured his position in the administration and sought to do nothing that might jeopardize it he hoped one day to be johnsons secretary of state
715984 if we go down this road we will not bring them to their knees or to the negotiating table we could bomb them back into the stone age they will disappear into the jungle and they will wait us out because they know something we know deep down and they know that we know which is that some day were going to go home
715985 profound personal insecurity and his egomania led him not only to personalize the goals he aspired to but also to personalize all forms of dissent
715986 the most thorough and best documented account yet of the american decision to go to war
715987 the survival of an independent government in south vietnam is so important to the security of all of southeast asia and to the free world that i can conceive of no alternative other than to take all necessary measures within our capability to prevent a communist victory
715988 remarks by leading civilians showed a willingness to consider the use of nuclear weapons in response to north vietnamese or chinese aggression against the south just as the chiefs had suggested
715989 when someone asked whether nuclear weapons might be used mcnamara said that he could not imagine such a case but mcgeorge bundy predicted that under certain circumstances both military and political pressure for their use might arise
715990 occurred largely because of cold war policies adopted by the state and defense departments in 1954 1956
715991 use of atomic weapons should result in a considerable reduction in friendly casualties and in a more rapid cessation of hostilities
715992 did everything it could to build up pro american anti communist regimes in southeast asia while preparing to meet renewed communist aggression with american military force including atomic weapons
715993 never questioned the assumptions of the pentagon and state department and supported intervention in southeast asia from 1961 on
715994 helped hide the true situation from the president the rest of the government and the american people thereby putting off the need to reevaluate american policy kennedy died believing mistakenly that the war was still going well
715995 accepted the need to conceal new departures from the american people and loyally collaborated in deceiving the public
715996 the first war in history lost in the columns of the new york times
715997 equipment is not what you need you need men that will fight and you need officers that will fight and will lead the men i dont think youve lost a tank to enemy fire you lost all the tanks in the 20th because the men abandoned them led by the officers youve lost most of your artillery because it was abandoned and people wouldnt fight
715998 were inspired in part by the example of the successful struggle of the indochinese communists against the united states
715999 around the globe from berlin to thailand are people whose well being rests in part on the belief that they can count on us if they are attacked to leave vietnam to its fate would shake the confidence of all these people in the value of americas commitment the value of americas word
716000 by enabling the north vietnamese to bleed the united states in combat
716001 often without realizing it in direct combat with soviet andchinese troops
716002 dissolve into word games or assertions resting on flimsy or nonexistent evidence
716003 made the correct decision to avoid a direct confrontation with the sino soviet bloc over indochina such a confrontation might have caused a localized conflict in southeast asia to escalate into a global conflict on the nuclear level
716004 the path of war seemed endless desperate and leading nowhere the soldiers waited in fear hoping they would not be ordered in as support forces to hurl themselves into the arena to almost certain death
716005 guard against the idea of the south having fought valiantly or been meritorious in any way
716006 what would a vietnamese make of a phrase that uses the name of his country to stand not for his nation but for a debacle in another nations history
716007 were strangely silent during the next period of their suffering when hundreds of thousands felt that their best choice was to entrust their lives and those of their children to tiny unseaworthy boats on the treacherous south china sea
716008 for a moment allow that having committed such errors should disqualify them from continuing to govern
716009 step outside their restrictive system only by thinking and speaking to their friends as though they lived in a free civil society they live in truth surrounded by many a lie
716010 but its will and ability to make its vital decisions independently were never in doubt
716011 was never able to step out of the large american shadow that enveloped him
716012 qualified southerners eager to serve now that peace had finally been restored
716013 the victory of the north by any accurate description was an attack by the north on the south we soldiers from the north feel sad today we feel sorry for the southerners
716014 the vietnamese are indeed not a reliable people an occupation does not last very long before they raise their arms against us and expel us from their country the history of past dynasties has proved this fact
716015 the more deeply one probes into the history of the us involvement in vietnam the more evident it becomes that a seriously distorted picture has been presented
716016 its the first time in my life i have won tournaments back to back
716017 usually i would win a tournament and the next week i would lose in the first round
716018 so i was happy when i won the first match and then i was just taking it one match at a time

716068 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
716069 to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
716070 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
716071 we deeply appreciate and value senator obamas perspective on this important issue
716072 i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of and i hope he will be the nominee
716073 theyve decided they cant win on the issues and so theyre going to try to destroy his character
716074 i have no idea what hes saying or what he means soaring rhetoric feel good persona ever changing positions
716075 the reason were not in town hall meetings testing these two candidates is because doesnt want to be tested

716080 the main reason santa is so jolly is because he knows where all the bad girls live
716081 it was a classic durango land use battle with 30 percent of the people saying you better not let them in 30 percent saying you better not keep them out and 40 percent saying we know you cant keep them out just make sure they do the right thing and thats what we tried to do
716082 ive hated to see durango change so much i didnt support wal mart coming in then either
716083 but quite honestly i try to balance my support wal mart saves a lot of us who cant afford the luxury of paying more for basic supplies or appliances by going there for those things it allows the common folk to support our local people too
716084 there are a lot of reasons that businesses fail but i dont think anybody has been directly forced out by wal mart
716085 it was not an easy process for them to go through they resented what they had to do here in durango
716086 in the big picture i think it dawned on them that if they built a good looking building it had a positive impact on their sales volume now people from farmington come up to shop here and they have their own wal mart down there
716087 its been shown theres need and room for retail at all levels but downtown cant be duplicated and you cant replace the experience of a downtown environment
716088 were thriving down here and we credit a lot of that to the community who sees the big picture and is willing to support businesses like ours but i wouldnt say theyve ever been a threat to our sales
716089 id have to say theyre welcome as far as were concerned because they havent affected our business one way or the other

716103 it has been a great week for the teams that are trying to survive it is no coincidence that those teams have stepped up they are all in survival mode you can have game plans and all that but at the end of the day the team that wants it the most and is passionate about it will always step up

716119 history has rarely seen factors like this occur at the same time
716120 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
716121 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
716122 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
716123 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
716124 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
716125 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
716126 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
716127 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation

716130 in order to revive and re energize efforts for nuclear disarmament we need to challenge the persistent notion that nuclear weapons are a necessary evil
716131 we need to remind people that even when these weapons are not actually used they exact an enormous cost in the form of monetary technological and human resources consumed to develop deploy and maintain them
716132 the only complete defence is the elimination of nuclear weapons and the assurance that they will never be produced again

716394 canada often praises itself of being party to all six major international human rights conventions that is missing one small point there are nine not six major human rights treaties and canada has not yet ratified the international convention on protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families
716395 the record shows that she was a determined advocate for the adoption of international human rights standards and that she spoke out for many victims around the world
716396 as a case study in how to strengthen and improve the proper role and functioning
716397 nations large and small exert considerable effort to avoid being named and shamed in the international arena as a violator of human rights
716398 many of them ruled by regimes with poor records on human rights and democracy including sri lanka myanmar pakistan sudan and zimbabwe out of 79 official criticisms of countries that arbour issued only 10 were dedicated to condemning free democracies
716399 arbour spoke out against certain violations by iran however unlike other high un officials she failed to address iranian president ahmadinejads anti semitic campaign of holocaust denial and incitement to genocide by contrast upon demands from certain un alliances arbour did issue statements about perceived offences to islam which may have encouraged the islamic states campaign at the un to curb freedom of speech

716402 when confronted by a large legal bill of approximately 10 000 from the defenders in a personal injury case i instructed the solicitors then representing me to lodge a motion to the court of session on basis you outline that is the clear potential for a serious conflict of interest arising given the auditor of the court of session would be ruling on matters relating to a fellow professionals expenses my solicitors refused to submit the motion claiming it was incompetent when i suggested it was for the court to decide this and i should at least be allowed the opportunity to present the motion and receive the courts decision my solicitors threatened to withdraw if i insisted on submitting the motion

716424 last weekend australians were warned that 80 per cent of the countrys truck drivers were about to go on strike for two weeks
716425 the organisers of the strike claimed that shops would run out of food within three days and that water would have to be rationed because the treatment plants would run out of chemicals
716426 despite these threats the strike failed with australias major trucking companies reporting no significant disruption it failed because australias truck drivers recognised that going on strike would not fix the issues facing our industry
716427 many people in the trucking industry are doing it tough and there is enormous frustration particularly about the forthcoming fatigue laws
716428 but our industrys issues can only be fixed through professionalism high standards and by talking to governments the ata and its member organisations have achieved enormous wins for the industry by taking this approach although we recognise there is always more to do
716429 the lesson of the strike is that operators and drivers who want to support the industry should join an ata member organisation the ata and its member organisations give the trucking industry a voice and a real chance to influence the federal and state governments
716430 the world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender there are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind there are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined we have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith we have enough greed we need more goodness we have enough vanity we need more virtue we have enough popularity we need more purity

716475 and i believe fundamentally that in 1980 the election was all about ronald reagan
716476 people did not want another four years of jimmy carter but they were not clear or comfortable for much of the way with whether reagan got over the bar of acceptability to be commander in chief and president of the united states

716501 this is my lifestyle but i wouldnt want a normal life or id get bored
716502 i always knew this was what i had to do
716503 i remember when i was really young standing on my bed like it was a stage singing at the top of my lungs and visualizing thousands of people surrounding me
716504 when i get upset and really need to get it out of me i go to my guitar sometimes i feel like my guitar is my therapist
716505 i started working with these really talented people but i just wasnt feeling it the songs werent representative of me
716506 then they started talking about having people write for me but i had to write myself i had to do my music it was a really stressful time but i never considered giving up
716507 we totally clicked because he just let me guide he really understood me and let me do my thing
716508 in this past year ive really grown as a writer complicated wasnt written about anyone in particular it is basically about life people being fake and relationships
716509 that is definitely one of my ex boys he didnt give me what i needed emotionally
716510 it doesnt matter now and plus i got a good song out of it

716520 were looking for people who can write cogent persuasive columns
716521 to be a champion you have to believe in yourself when nobody else will
716522 obstacles dont have to stop you if you run into a wall dont turn around and give up figure out how to climb it go through it or work around it
716523 lifes battles dont always go to the stronger or faster man but sooner or later the man who wins is the man who thinks he can
716524 although cew tries to blame lynda it is difficult to defend someone whose actions are indefensible and heidi you are a good mom it is so hard to defend someone you know
716525 if you get the right incident the american public will support
716526 are we playing high school with you know 5 000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal yeah we are were playing you know whos the first guy to run off the highway with us and iran
716527 the u s was thinking of flying u2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over iraq painted in u n colours
716528 if saddam fired on them he would be in breach
716529 if there was security in the south why would we come here
716530 we will stay here even for 10 years until the bombardment ends
716531 do you know the taliban entered kandahar city and broke into the prison
716532 there were armored vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
716533 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
716534 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
716535 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us
716536 the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
716537 there was fighting in the village a hundred times roadside bombs bombardment firing and shooting
716538 the taliban are coming during the night with heavy weapons riding on vehicles and we cannot even dare ask them to leave because if they see someone at night outside they will slaughter them and accuse them of being spies
716539 his mother was cooking and he was lying beside her
716540 the whole village was destroyed and after that we left
716541 we dont know from which side they fired but we heard that
716542 if the taliban fire from over there do you come and bomb this village
716543 we only want a stable country whether with the taliban or the foreigners
716544 if they kill if they wound innocent people we dont want them
716545 if they build and bring peace we will accept them
716546 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
716547 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
716548 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
716549 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
716550 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
716551 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
716552 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
716553 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
716554 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way
716555 distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era
716556 theres just a handful of us left but it has become easier for us domestic folks to compete
716557 this is not just about steel but also maple syrup and avocados and blueberries at the grocery store
716558 avocado salad in minneapolis in january is just not going to work in this new world because flying it in is going to make it cost as much as a rib eye
716559 being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money
716560 green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down
716561 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
716562 they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production
716563 i didnt know you could do that with your body sexually
716564 it is the hardest decision but also the easiest decision ive ever had to make
716565 i gave it all i could give i wish i could have had one more stab at australia but ive had five unbelievable years played in some exciting games and unbelievable series ive lost matches won matches and felt all the emotions but it is right time to move forward now as captain
716566 that was very special to be part of a series that captured a nation people in the street coming up to congratulate me people who had never seen cricket before was very special
716567 i am moving better than ever in the field and hopefully i will make a few runs for yorkshire and get back
716568 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
716569 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
716570 its something ive been thinking about for some time and really it was thursday night the night before i made the century believe it or not and thats when i told the wife and i knew it was time to go
716571 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
716572 excuse me have you seen a blowfish driving a sports car
716573 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
716574 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
716575 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
716576 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
716577 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
716578 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
716579 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
716580 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
716581 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
716582 i said sure what can come of such a case
716583 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
716584 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
716585 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
716586 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in renal failure and that we are now seeing three times a week for dialysis
716587 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
716588 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
716589 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
716590 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
716591 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
716592 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
716593 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
716594 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
716595 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
716596 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
716597 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
716598 that facility could have taken care of me any day
716599 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
716600 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
716601 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
716602 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
716603 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
716604 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
716605 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home
716606 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
716607 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
716608 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
716609 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
716610 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
716611 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
716612 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
716613 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
716614 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
716615 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
716616 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
716617 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
716618 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
716619 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
716620 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
716621 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
716622 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
716623 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
716624 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you
716625 if people are worried that because im taking over doctor who its going to be really really frightening well then tough
716626 the do something awards the pre party of the teen choice awards
716627 i refuse to sit back like we did in 2000 and 2004 this administration is the worst administration in american foreign policy in modern history maybe ever the idea that they are competent to continue to conduct our foreign policy to make us more secure and make israel secure is preposterous every single thing theyve touched has been a near disaster
716628 are we capturing killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting training and deploying against us
716629 based on my experience in talking to al qaeda members
716630 futile and immoral policy of containment which abandons countless human beings to a despotism and godless terrorism
716631 im not going to be the one to announce this decision you need to address your interest in this to the state department

716635 its a very clear choice and whether it be on iran or whether it be on iraq or whether it be on other national security issues
716636 senator obama does not have the experience and the knowledge and clearly the judgment my friends
716637 i will not accept from senator obama who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform any lectures on my regard for those who did
716638 liberals saw the savagery of the 9 11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers
716639 we have only two choices appeasement or war suicide or surrender humiliation or holocaust to be either red or dead
716640 since 9 11 our principal export to the world has been our fear
716641 when people feel uncertain theyd rather have somebody whos strong and wrong than somebody whos weak and right

716648 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
716649 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
716650 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
716651 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
716652 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
716653 sehwag scoring 201 in a total of 329 was amazing he played two superb knocks in both innings to ensure we had a decent score to defend the opening wicket partnerships were very crucial for us
716654 we have regrouped and done it in the past and the way our openers batted and sharma and harbhajan bowled augurs well for the third test
716655 restricting india to a 269 total in the second innings was brilliant our batting was not consistent and thats where we lost a target of 307 was a good score to chase and we didnt get the ideal start
716656 this is the last chance for flight to paris the doors are closing
716657 valeri was probably the big bonus from the draw at stockport
716658 it was important that he was able to get on the pitch clear his mind that he is free from injury now we can move forward it is up to the strikers to grab the initiative and show what they can do and he did that for the short time he was on the pitch
716659 we have high hopes that he will come back bigger faster and stronger because his work in training is really explosive and dynamic and once he has worked on his match fitness that will help us
716660 elite was a truly seminal property that featured some concepts that have still not been emulated to this day
716661 the value of the elite ip rights in todays market is difficult to ascertain as it has been well overa decade since the last release
716662 however the popularity of elites core gameplay concepts in many of todays best selling offline and online titles and the failure in critics eyes of the market to produce a comparable elite style game that lives up to the original release would suggest that it still has considerable potential
716663 i would clearly love to carry on with that cast
716664 we had such a wonderful time shooting we were constantly cracking up but its too early to speculate we really have everything going for us
716665 its the perfect time to bring it back and show these characters in their early years and get a bit of a backstory
716666 its just the right time i feel to move forward with a new captain and new direction
716667 ive put my heart and soul into the job but my head is telling me to pack it in
716668 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsmen i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
716669 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
716670 there are areas which really help the umpires but there are areas where it takes a longer time
716671 there is still some doubt whether someone looking at a television can make a call
716672 ive enjoyed every minute since linking up with manager steve bruce again and i love the wigan fans
716673 this victory is bigger than just us so therefore i would have to say that it is my best
716674 ive got some really meaningful innings in my life like the double hundreds here at this ground and at lords in 2003 they have got to go down as some of my greatest achievements
716675 but so many south africa teams have come here since readmission and strived for victories so there are so many people back home who id like to have shared this with tonight
716676 we got off to such a good start at 65 for none and i thought a couple of more partnerships and we are there and all of a sudden after a couple of good deliveries and some sightscreen issues we were 93 for four
716677 then i just started focusing on taking my innings by ten runs at a time
716678 its a real bitter blow because when we had that partnership in the morning between paul collingwood and ryan sidebottom and set them 280 i would have put us to win because i knew the wicket was wearing
716679 weve just witnessed a very special innings by graeme smith under that kind of pressure we had that flurry of wickets in the afternoon when i thought wed blow them away but graeme smith and south africa over the last three matches have been better than us

716700 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying

716708 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
716709 there is nothing on the record to indicate obama ever withdrew his support from odinga
716710 even after odinga signed the agreement with the muslims in kenya
716711 appears even today to be a direct and active supporter of odinga as odinga himself frequently boasts
716712 something obama has done almost every day since he arrived in kenya last week
716713 i think odinga has to look at critically where he is receiving his advice from just because somebody wants to run for president and he is using senator obama as his stooge as his puppet to be able to get where he wants to get
716714 for their own separate reasons odinga and sheik abdullah abdi joined forces
716715 sheik abdullah abdi agreed to swing islamic voters to odinga in kenya and odinga agreed to support islam should he become president
716716 by endorsing raila odinga during his 2006 visit to kenya obama positioned himself to be seen by kenyans as an important u s senator who was joining forces with his luo tribal kinsman this positioning further sided obama with raila odinga as he ran against president mwai kibaki in the december 2007 presidential election in kenya

716724 in one of their wards there was a credit machine that was unattended and she was there to visit a family member and decided lets try it so she had swiped her debit card for the 200 and it worked
716725 what she would do is people would say oh i need money and she would say give me your debit card and she would go there and transfer 10 000 15 000 and they would have it in their bank account the next day go to the bank withdraw next month and say whats it for oh im buying a car or my friend just paid me for this so it wasnt suspicious
716726 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
716727 the big idea being bandied around at the moment is the reality tv show it would be based on tv talent show searches like the bbc did to find an actress to play maria in the sound of music
716728 there are a number of channel 4 executives who are keen on the idea but there is a fear that some stuffy viewers may not like it

716754 nasa hopes the falcon 9 can help fill the mission gap that will exist while it develops a successor to the shuttle
716755 we are hearing from the launch control center that there has been an anomaly on that vehicle
716756 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit
716757 unfortunately a problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together this is under investigation

716765 we should take things slowly because in the beginning everything is always pink
716766 the future of nashville is under construction now future generations have to live with what we as developers create that places a heavy responsibility on us to be excellent to only be involved in quality developments alex s palmer amp company is totally committed to developing space that is as functional and aesthetic as we can possibly make it for out time and for the future
716767 how can two large retial developments both survive in the st clair county area
716768 we learned it would cost 8 000 apiece to demolish them but found out they can be moved for 5 800 apiece

716772 if it hadnt been for a group of fraternity guys
716773 the voting system in the u s is still not sufficiently accurate to determine the winner in a very close election
716774 by the time were done with the mock election nobody will have any doubt
716775 i got to the point where i couldnt finish the pitches
716776 i still feel it a little bit but its 100 better than last week
716777 im surprised its gone on this long for one reason we are perilously close to going bankrupt to not being able to pay our bills
716778 that also tells a lot of people whether their firefighters teachers or nurses after we get these people were going to come after you
716779 republicans dont want to make the cuts that are necessary to balance the budget without a tax increase
716780 they were engaged in criminal activities and inciting the public
716781 on the issue of being held for more than 48 hours before being produced in court contrary to the law police told me that they needed to investigate more because these people had committed serious crimes
716782 i wasnt satisfied with the police explanation but i didnt see any big crisis because police told me that there was a remedy
716783 the mistake of the other magistrate was to say release them unconditionally because you dont know what crime they had committed suppose they had committed a serious crime that introduces impunity
716784 the procedures are important but even more important is the substance of the cases i am satisfied that there is the rule of law in uganda even if there is a breach there are ways for that to be solved
716785 stark reminders of the fragility of peace in the sudan
716786 the root cause of the problem has been the failure of the two parties to agree on an approach to implement the abyei protocol
716787 from the discipline the respect the attention to detail and awareness of how a team works all those lessons carried me through life
716788 it was as if you just rang my bell and it rang to the core
716789 most everyone was on a steady diet of ibuprofen and there were a lot of knee braces and back braces
716790 i realized this man really had a kind heart and a kind soul
716791 i nudged the guy next to me and said hey look its dede she looks exactly the same
716792 it was like the best thing that ever happened to you in your life
716793 you get goose bumps thinking about it and your heart has this feeling of wanting to burst
716794 if there is anyone present that has just cause why this couple should not be united
716795 i had come to the realization that i would likely spend the rest of my days without that special person in my life
716796 if anyone ever asked me what part of my life you are i would just have to look at them and smile and say the best part
716797 there is no cabinet minister who has handed me a resignation letter but there are some cabinet members whom i wanted to replace who i heard are part of the ministers announcing their resignations
716798 i asked him for a debate on mohamed dheere but he pm nur adde said he there is no debate because he pm nur adde already made the decision to fire mohamed dheere
716799 the phenomenon is universal and pervasive in kenya it is not confined to one class age group or region the causes as well as the consequences of being a single mother vary
716800 kenyan parents do not accept daughters back in their home once they are married my mother told me to go back to my husband and persevere as she had done with my father but i wanted to take control of my life even if that meant raising the children myself in hardship
716801 i was pregnant when i became single and went to the family planning association for advice and help soon i joined them and was then selected by a german organisation for a course in berlin to become a trainer of community workers myself
716802 i had completed my form iv higher secondary but after the child was born neither my family nor my school wanted me back if i had wanted to study further at all i had to go to a different school
716803 i did not want the child after my boyfriend left me because he himself was still in school but as a mother i could not abandon him
716804 we have worked with mothers as young as 13 and widows as old as 40 years old their needs are different from each other and it takes a network of womens groups to address them
716805 our financial and human resources are too small and the magnitude of the problem is too big the best we can do is to pool our strengths through networking
716806 unmarried girls who become pregnant face three alternatives she may marry the father if she is in school she most likely will drop out the marriage as well as the pregnancy may be unwanted and soon result in divorce or abandonment often experiencing societal disapproval and economic hardship or she may have an abortion typically illegal and unsafe
716807 schools in the formal system prefer not to readmit those who get pregnant while studying even though there is no law barring them
716808 above all young mothers become adults directly after childhood without the intervening phase of adolescence
716809 the main risk factor is the low latrine coverage in the newly created idp camps or in the villages to which the people are returning most people use the bush and when it rains the water takes the faeces into water sources and contaminates them
716810 our population still practices communal hand washing or use water in the same basin so if one of them visited the toilet and his or her faeces had hepatitis e then the others will definitely get the virus
716811 an average of 112 people share one latrine in the idp camps almost six times above the standard requirement of 20 people per latrine
716812 we need an independent electoral commission so that we can get the military and security agents out of the electoral process because they promote the nrm interests
716813 the other area of co operation we need to work on
716814 is fielding one candidate and formation of a coalition government after winning elections this is what we call electoral alliance
716815 the issue of fielding a single presidential candidate is something that is so far away
716816 we need to study each other and build confidence you cant rush just to remove the nrm for the sake of it before you reach a point of talking about one presidential candidate build confidence stop bashing each other and we must develop a working relationship
716817 we are moving in different directions the opposition who came before us view new entrants with suspicious eyes and that dents the single candidate project
716818 we need to look at our programmes examine them and harmonise our strategies
716819 nobody has told me anything that is contrary to this approach
716820 i think all those who are pro democracy are pro co operation but there are malingerers within the opposition there are sympathisers of the ruling regime who claim to be with us but are with the nrm
716821 yes collaboration is all right but we need to ensure the electoral law is changed in time
716822 the question of presidency and removal is diverting us from building parties as institutions
716823 i am deeply troubled about the continuing threats and attacks against humanitarian agencies working in darfur
716824 following two attacks against their teams and premises in just one week m decins sans fronti res has announced it has no choice but to evacuate its team from two locations in north darfur the departure of msf team leaves some 65 000 people without essential medical assistance
716825 impunity for such attacks must end hundreds of thousands of people rely on the assistance these aid organizations deliver and we cannot afford to have them absent from darfur
716826 the united states abstained because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president omar al bashir
716827 criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes
716828 18 utility helicopters and about 12 to 18 combat helicopters that can go to do reconnaissance and other things as of today there is no country in the world that has volunteered to give us that capability zero
716829 already two children are said to have died of hunger many others are malnourished
716830 most of the displaced are now resorting to eating fruit from the acacia trees the only accessible thing
716831 the idps have become displaced again this time they are heading to the southern districts where there are no local and international aid agencies
716832 only a few business premises are open the hospitals are however totally closed
716833 there are an estimated 15 000 idps in the town with little or nothing to eat their situation is very desperate
716834 most are from mogadishu but we also have people who have lost their livestock and moved to the town in search of help
716835 the current environment of conflict displacement and insecurity in southern and central somalia has a seriously negative impact on childrens and young peoples long term psychosocial welfare and healthy development
716836 after tearing the clothes of their victims and raping them in turns in full view of the entire family the assailants would turn to their victims husbands and kill them
716837 women were sexually and physically abused by all people their tribesmen the raiders and even service providers in the camps where they were perceived to be safe
716838 you have to take in a substantial amount of faeces about one gram to be able to get hepatitis e
716839 i dont think anyone intends to eat faeces but because of poor hygiene they end up consuming food with faeces
716840 the main thrust of the accelerated response will be to break the transmission chain at individual and household levels where the problem originates
716841 the accelerated response will also reinforce case management through provision of medicines and supplies and increase the number of qualified health workers in some health facilities
716842 the ministry of health should send film vans to carry out sensitisation because much as we are blaming the local leaders for not doing enough to sensitise the people the people at the centre have also not done much
716843 we need these technical people to tell us what interventions they have put in place
716844 you have to take in a substantial amount of faeces about one gram to be able to get hepatitis e
716845 i dont think anyone intends to eat faeces but because of poor hygiene they end up consuming food with faeces
716846 environmental health experts from the ministry of health headquarters have since confirmed that all water sources in the affected areas except the boreholes are contaminated
716847 after these violent attacks we have had to suspend activities and evacuate all our staff from tawila and shangil tobaya
716848 it was a difficult decision because this suspension of activities leaves the people with no medical care but it is impossible for our teams to work and provide medical aid without a minimum guarantee of security and respect for humanitarian work
716849 these days you sometimes go out there and come back empty handed
716850 my income has declined by over 70 percent and the impact on my familys livelihood is serious i am struggling to make ends meet trying to establish other businesses to balance the situation
716851 i have had to change my childrens schools to ones that i can afford
716852 the fishing business is no longer sustainable and many of my friends feel frustrated i am thinking about selling some of my assets to diversify my options i am beginning to fail to provide some essential needs for my family
716853 this has been brought about by carelessness of both the communities and governments along the lake we dont know how long it will go on because we have talked to everybody who could listen but the authorities are more interested in development
716854 but information indicates that only 10 percent of the sewage gets treated
716855 we have many players licensed to go fishing by local governments to mitigate this we are planning to again centralise licensing because local governments are more interested in the revenue not conservation
716856 we were earning over 150 million from fish exports in the past years but i dont think that we shall even earn 90 million this year
716857 anybody attracted by the huge demand available on the market can get his boat and line up his gear to start fishing
716858 this has created a lot of pressure on the lake and the fishing gear used is not the best to allow the resource to renew
716859 we also plan to promote the use of fishing gear that allows the fish to grow as mostly young fish are being caught currently
716860 the flower factories are all located along the lake in all three countries and they use a lot of chemicals that end up in the lake
716861 over 75 percent of the wetlands have been significantly affected by human activities and 13 percent are severely degraded
716862 population growth around the continents largest lake is significantly higher than the rest of africa
716863 if they are not managed properly the continents lakes face loss of sustainability for future generations
716864 from the preliminary results cyanobacteria like anabaena were found in the water samples these can be very toxic for plants and animals including humans because of the toxin microcystin
716865 they can accumulate in the fish tissues liver intestines and gallbladder which means that secondary contamination by eating toxic fish from an infected pond or lake is possible
716866 all our companies in the world will have one brand name
716867 it is very important that the name reflects our values and our strength this is what we hope to achieve with zain
716868 this is a very important acquisition for celtel as the operator with the largest footprint in africa we bring a broad understanding of the trends and challenges of mobile telephony the perfect complement to kencells successful experience in kenya
716869 contrary to most of the other markets the second operator celtel not only failed to narrow its lag behind safaricom in terms of market share but lost subscribers in the second half of 2007
716870 moved to the cuban camp with the full consent of the kenyan government as part of collaboration between the two governments to fight global terrorism
716871 we are working on equipping our troops because i think the mission and the purpose of the mission has great importance in as far as the lives of people who are affected in darfur are concerned
716872 its not good to just keep saying if there isnt this am going away because that would belittle the importance of the mission i dont think that is what anybody intends to do
716873 one is what could be provided by the un using the countries that have means
716874 what we did was we linked it with karenzis indictment
716875 first of all we have a problem with the indictments in a general sense but also with the un a body we belong to that should try to be fair to all its members and which is behind the establishment of the ictr international criminal tribunal for rwanda
716876 they listen or base their decision on what a french or spanish judge is saying about somebody from a member country before they put them to work that itself is strange and we made this clear to them
716877 it is reflective of the failure of political will across the board on everything that has to do with darfur and sudan
716878 it means a way of responding timely to incidents as they occur around the darfur region and the troops can respond rapidly to incidents when they are developing
716879 it is becoming very difficult to help darfuris on the ground who are suffering from continual attacks
716880 people who are familiar with operations in iraq and afghanistan would know that the lives of soldiers and civilians and chances of surviving from injuries improve dramatically with access to helicopters
716881 the member states of the security council and especially the p5 britain france russia china and the u s have authorised the icc to investigate the killing in sudan theyve authorised the hybrid protection force theyve authorised ambassador salim to launch a peace process that would conclude with an agreement for sudan
716882 in each case however when required to provide back up efforts it failed and the failure to provide helicopters has direct consequences for the people on the ground and for the peacekeepers
716883 no heavy lift helicopters have been transferred or provided making it impossible for the force to be mobile confront aggression or even defend itself
716884 since january first according to the secretary general 190 000 darfuris have been displaced and nine people have lost their lives
716885 from the perspective of the coalition it is outrageous that the members of the security council send troops into a conflict zone without the minimum of the equipment needed to protect themselves
716886 i encourage european governments and the united states to come forward and tell the world what theyve got available and what they can make available
716887 this leads to a wide range of possible forcing scenarios
716888 we are totally against the killing of aid workers and call upon all somali people to embrace peace
716889 the somali civil society and media were equally hard hit with killings of a well known peace activist in beletweyne and a journalist in kismayo
716890 unfortunately july started off on an equally sad note with the killing of a senior un staff member in mogadishu on 6 july
716891 and everything must be done to ensure they come to an end
716892 the government position is that it does not condone the killing or kidnapping of those who are trying to help the somali people
716893 the government does not condone torture and in any case the joint forces were strictly directed to operate within the rule of law
716894 hey eliana so what are you doing for the prom
716895 we started the work on monday morning june 30 i provided some site specific training to the crew on chemicals that we knew had been found at the apartment and then we mobilized to the site within the first few minutes i found two bottles of an unknown unlabeled material under the kitchen sink they were plastic bottles but the caps had been covered over with tape probably to make sure the bottles did not leak since the bottles were out of the way our five person crew continued working on setting everything up and began to move some of the bulk debris
716896 met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew called black forest berry honest tea
716897 its hard to imagine america responding to small ball when we have all these problems
716898 so much whining about his opponent and so few new ideas of his own alter confesses to being disappointed in a senator he once thought wouldnt engage in such the real question is what all of this might mean for a mccain presidency
716899 let us not look backward in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness
716900 we started the work on monday morning june 30 i provided some site specific training to the crew on chemicals that we knew had been found at the apartment and then we mobilized to the site within the first few minutes i found two bottles of an unknown unlabeled material under the kitchen sink they were plastic bottles but the caps had been covered over with tape probably to make sure the bottles did not leak since the bottles were out of the way our five person crew continued working on setting everything up and began to move some of the bulk debris
716901 het is erg prettig om voor de tweede week op rij een toernooi te winnen
716902 normaal gezien win ik een toernooi en verlies ik een week later in de eerste ronde
716903 es un p rdida total de tiempo y atenci n en un momento en que millones de personas est n perdiendo sus casas y sus puestos de trabajo
716904 es una manera fr vola de escoger al nuevo presidente de estados unidos
716905 creemos que es humor stico nos la estamos pasando bien y lo estamos disfrutando
716906 una p rdida enorme del dinero que donan los admiradores de mccain a su campa a
716907 ik ga me niet verontschuldigen voor iets waarvoor het ioc niet verantwoordelijk is
716908 ik ga me niet verontschuldigen voor iets waarvoor het ioc niet verantwoordelijk is
716909 fantastisch om te zien dat ook zoveel jonge mensen zijn teksten helemaal kunnen meezingen
716910 belangrijkste vaststelling is wellicht dat gemoedelijkheid dit festival blijft kenmerken ondanks de schaalvergroting van de voorbije jaren
716911 nu en dan kregen we wat regen te verwerken maar voor problemen zorgde dat niet
716912 hier en daar gooien we wat stro uit op modderige plekken
716913 ik ga me niet verontschuldigen voor iets waarvoor het ioc niet verantwoordelijk is
716914 luego de encontrar a la primera buscamos entre cientos de piedras y hallamos otra
716915 las diferencias en los animales peque os son mucho m s sutiles y por eso frecuentemente se pasan por alto
716916 el adn es tan diferente entre dos peque as serpientes como entre dos grandes lo que nos permite observar las diferencias que no vemos a simple vista
716917 el hombre acusado en la haya fue ubicado y detenido en una acci n realizada por las fuerzas de seguridad serbias
716918 escenas infernales escritas en las p ginas m s oscuras de la historia de la humanidad
716919 la detenci n de karadzic abrir las puertas europeas a serbia
716920 este pa s necesita asistencia financiera y pol tica para las reformas que comenz a principios de 2000 tras la ca da de milosevic la nica forma de lograrlo es unirse totalmente a la comunidad internacional esta detenci n es un paso en la direcci n correcta
716921 es una noticia horrible y este d a por el lunes es el m s triste de la historia de serbia
716922 serbia puede desaparecer por las decisiones de los traidores dem cratas que en cualquier momento entregan al pa s a los extranjeros
716923 la noticia llev alivio a las familias de las v ctimas aunque un poco tarde
716924 just take on this one class until november they are so brilliant i do not want to abandon them at this stage
716925 only about 10 knew about the benefits of voluntary testing and counseling and less that 50 knew their serostatus
716926 you simply cannot conserve marine resources successfully without talking to local communities
716927 people use these resources intensively their lives depend on them it is just not possible to conserve without looking at what problems the communities face
716928 madagascars conservation areas have traditionally been in wilderness regions with small human populations
716929 now with a push towards creating so many more protected areas they are increasingly going to be in places where they affect far greater numbers of people this calls for a whole new approach to the management of protected areas
716930 the people who live and work in an area feel it is their territory
716931 they do not they cannot be told by others what to do using a top down approach just creates problems it is better to start from the bottom and work upwards
716932 some villages are aware that resource degradation is a serious problem and they want to solve it but in some areas this is not the case we can guide and give advice but its not our role to impose marine parks or ban fishing in an area
716933 there are many problems here but first we need to help reduce fishing
716934 but to do that people need other work they need other jobs so they dont need to fish
716935 ser un banco ultramoderno para ayudar a todos no s lo a los ricos y la clase media sino tambi n al pueblo hasta en los sitios m s apartados y pobres
716936 uno de los planes que tengo con el bbanco de venezuela una vez sea nacionalizado en las pr ximas semanas va a ser municipalizarlo que llegue a todo el pa s
716937 la oposici n sali a decir que nos estrellamos incluso algunos empezaron a decir que est bamos arremetiendo contra espa a y es que esos venezolanos no tienen patria son ap tridas
716938 y esos quieren gobernar a venezuela nunca m s la gobernar n volver n superm n rin tin tin capulina y tint n pero ustedes nunca volver n escu lidos
716939 the decision is basically a formalisation of the reality because unmee has really not been on the ground
716940 both countries do not want to go to war but the situation is very sensitive and the troops are close to each other
716941 the mission was sent at the request of both countries to keep the peace after a two year war claimed at least 70 000 ethiopian and eritrean lives
716942 it was a difficult mission in geographically harsh locations but the men and women who served did not flinch
716943 the secretary general expresses hope that the parties would be able to break the current stalemate and create conditions necessary for the normalisation of their relations which is key to peace and stability in the region
716944 there is no clear mechanism for engagement at the moment
716945 ethiopia has a firm stand that the conflict between ethiopia and eritrea ought to be solved through peaceful means
716946 unmees presence was really symbolic it was not a peace enforcement force it does not have the capability of deterrent so its not going to have any impact
716947 legally ethiopias occupation of eritrea is untenable it cannot be accepted by the international community i think our focus has been on the legal end and the diplomatic dimensions of the issue
716948 both regimes have used it as an excuse to enhance their domestic power at the expense of democracy and economic growth thus reducing the attractiveness to them of diplomatic compromise
716949 they support the others domestic rebels and each is convinced that the fall of the others regime is imminent and the only real solution to the border dispute
716950 tive oportunidade de estar com eles h um tempo atr s no afeganist o e da parte das autoridades militares os elogios nossa for a foram extremamente gratificantes
716951 a for a tinha duas miss es atribu das uma o compromisso com a isaf for a internacional de assist ncia e seguran a no afeganist o e no final da miss o com a isaf t nhamos o compromisso e a miss o de fazer a retrac o dos meios e os materiais que estavam no teatro de opera es no afeganist o para territ rio nacional parte disso eu tinha uma terceira miss o que foi conseguida e que era de trazer todos os militares s os e salvos a portugal
716952 eu estive presente estava na coluna mas tive grande confian a pois os meus homens conseguiram superar a amea a instantaneamente com o seu poder de fogo
716953 na altura em que eu fui n o havia metade das coisas que h agora como estradas e pavimentos
716954 as saudades s o bastantes e estar longe deles foi muito complicado principalmente porque foi a primeira vez que foi em miss o para o estrangeiro
716955 eu apenas comecei a escrever o gui o mas quando falei com os produtores do projecto soube que eles come aram activamente a procurar o actor que possa encarnar a imagem de l nine entre outros pretendem come ar conversa es com os agentes de leonardo dicaprio o que sa do de todo o cora o e estou disposto se for necess rio a fazer altera es no gui o para que o actor querido de todos aceite a proposta
716956 n o h d vida de que dicaprio um actor de muito talento e multifacetado mas quando come mos a olhar para a sua fotografia e a compar la com algumas fotos de l nine principalmente na inf ncia e juventude a semelhan a simplesmente impressionante eu diria mesmo que leonardo pode desempenhar o papel de dirigente da revolu o sem maquilhagem
716957 uma com dia grotesca onde nos finais do s c xx os nossos cientistas criam um clone de l nine que por for a do destino vai para os estados unidos e a em 2024 faz uma revolu o socialista
716958 na realidade entre ele e l nine existe uma semelhan a impressionante quase ao n vel gen tico sabido que dicaprio tem ra zes eslavas os seus antepassados do lado materno emigraram da r ssia para a alemanha quem sabe se eles se cruzaram com vladimir ilitch
716959 quando se olha para as fotografias do jovem l nine e de leonardo dicaprio fica se impressionado com a semelhan a interior a testa alta a express o id ntica do rosto
716960 se dicaprio realmente desempenhar o papel de l nine isso ser um grande salto naquilo a que chamamos
716961 nesse filme poder haver tantos anti americanismos de qualidade que os americanos se ir o rir mais do que o mundo se riu com borat
716962 dicaprio um grande actor e pode desempenhar qualquer papel penso que esse papel poder despertar nele um grande talento como c mico
716963 estamos convencidos de que es tiempo de detener el sida pueden contar con espa a para ello
716964 compromiso firme del gobierno de espa a en la lucha contra el sida
716965 el incremento constante de las aportaciones al fondo global de lucha contra el vih la tuberculosis y la malaria que para el periodo 2008 2012 alcanzar los 600 millones de d lares
716966 esperanza de vida de un enfermo de sida en los pa ses de renta media y alta haya aumentado entre 14 y 25 a os
716967 exactamente el mismo n mero de a os que ha retrocedido la esperanza de vida en aquellos pa ses de menor renta
716968 the conduct actions and unwarranted utterances by mr kimunya amount to gross misconduct and the chair speaker strongly takes great exception to them i therefore without any reservation severely reprimand the member for kipipiri for gross misconduct
716969 by alleging that if the substantive speaker was in chair the motion would not have been allowed mr kimunya cast aspersions on the integrity capacity and independence of the chair it was far fetched speculative and unacceptable
716970 kimunya cast aspersions on this house at a goat eating ceremony where he said that were the speaker in the country the motion would not have passed
716971 mr speaker sir we are turning to you to clarify whether or not you gave assurances that the motion passed by the house in the former minister was out of order
716972 what i said about carrying debate outside applies only to debates on substantive motions which result in a definite solution the subject matter of such debates indeed must not be discussed by hon member publicly outside the house while debate is pending whatever the nature of the proceedings things said by hon members in this house may only be answered by other members in this house
716973 to show maximum restraint and refrain from any threat or use of force against each other and to avoid provocative military activities
716974 reached a level so as to undermine the basis of the missions mandate and compelled it to temporarily relocate from eritrea
716975 by accident or design following the withdrawal of unmee remains a reality
716976 the work of unmee is coming to an end not because its mandate has been implemented but because it has become impossible for the mission to implement it
716977 the responsibility for the current impasse falls on the parties and on the parties alone
716978 reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements of its president pertaining to the situation between ethiopia and eritrea
716979 stressing once again its unwavering commitment to the peace process and to the full and expeditious implementation of the agreement on cessation of hostilities of 18 june 2000 s 2000 601 and the peace agreement of 12 december 2000 s 2000 1183 hereinafter referred to as
716980 considering that ethiopia and eritrea bear a shared responsibility in the implementation of the algiers agreements in which they agreed that the delimitation and demarcation determinations of the eritrea ethiopia boundary commission eebc shall be final and binding and that their forces shall respect the integrity of the temporary security zone tsz
716981 regretting that eritreas obstructions towards the united nations mission in ethiopia and eritrea unmee reached a level so as to undermine the basis of the missions mandate and compelled unmee to temporarily relocate from eritrea stressing that this relocation was without prejudice to the algiers agreements and to the integrity of the tsz and recalling the security councils previous condemnation of eritreas lack of cooperation
716982 having considered the special report of the secretary general of 7 april 2008 s 2008 226 the letters from ethiopia and eritrea dated respectively 17 and 18 june 2008 in response to the letters of the president of the security council of 10 june 2008 and the letter from the secretary general of 28 july 2008 s 2008 496 in response to the letter of the president of the security council of 3 july 2008
716983 2 demands ethiopia and eritrea to comply fully with their obligations under the algiers agreements to show maximum restraint and refrain from any threat or use of force against each other and to avoid provocative military activities
716984 4 requests the secretary general to further explore with ethiopia and eritrea the possibility of a united nations presence in ethiopia and eritrea in the context of the maintenance of international peace and security
716985 to say that trolls pose a threat to the internet at this point is like saying that crows pose a threat to farming
716986 yes i think we all troll from time to time most often in person were just not always aware of it
716987 be conservative in what you do be liberal in what you accept from others
716988 the americans have already dubbed all thats going on in libya the
716989 the fact is that qaddafis 2003 decision to denounce terrorism and shut down libyan development of nuclear chemical and biological weapons has been portrayed as a sudden conversion although negotiations with the americans had begun under president clinton 1993 2001 and the reason is almost too cynical and embarrassing to tell by clintons second term his administration was coming under strong pressure from american oil firms because in defiance of u n and e u sanctions italys eni frances total and spains pepsol already had large scale operations in libya western experts estimate that the cost of production of high quality libyan crude is just 1 per barrel
716990 four ragpickers were killed and several were injured in the blast it appears to be an explosion of a crude bomb
716991 les premiers 60 km sont plats ensuite il y a douze c tes et douze descentes et le kilom tre final est en mont e explique paco antequera le s lectionneur espagnol cest id al pour valverde qui se d fend tr s bien sur ce genre de parcours s lectifs

716997 i saw a little girl in tears she was looking for her parents
716998 luckily she was able to give me her name i grabbed her and ran to the gates but it was too late
716999 it is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage but not a child this never happens
717000 it is the worst tragedy on k2 since 1986 when 12 climbers were killed due to exposure
717001 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain i panicked when a pakistani high altitude carrier fell straight onto my back with his entire weight
717002 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
717003 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
717004 at present it is believed that anyone who is classified as position unknown will not be coming back
717005 the lower they come to the ground the closer they are to safety but they are totally exhausted and not out of danger yet
717006 at least 15 militants were killed and many injured in an exchange of fire with security forces near sij bund in matta district
717007 le maintien est obligatoire et ce le plus vite possible
717008 a sample kept on site exploded which led to the plutonium leak inside the laboratory
717009 continued factional infighting harms the palestinian cause and threatens efforts to help establish an independent palestinian state
717010 dialogue is important we have called for it egypt has agreed to invite palestinian factions to meet in cairo
717011 we cant lose hope we disagree and fight but we have to work together to bridge the big gap created unfortunately by hamas
717012 as treatment options have increased and the risks of untreated viremia viral infection are better appreciated the risk benefit ratio is shifting toward early treatment
717013 progress with antiretroviral rollout in the developing world is encouraging but recent advances in the highly resourced world need to be adapted and translated to the developing world to realise these benefits
717014 we know there are lot of cars that are 15 20 years old that are not sold by their owners fearing that they will not get a price for them
717015 we want to tap into that segment of old fiat ambassador or even a maruti 800 and offer them a new car
717016 we determine the worst case scrap price for the car and add an exchange bonus or a replacement incentive into the package which can go up to rs 40 000
717017 the company has created a database of hundreds of scrap dealers across the country and invites them for an auction with a collection of around 100 cars the scrap dealers then bid for the cars and are provided with a detailed technical condition report for each car
717018 over 75 per cent of our clients are from the upper middle class strata
717019 we are already retailing our products in mumbai and will soon open molton brown stores in delhi and bangalore
717020 we have been pressurising companies to have their own grievance management systems
717021 if the ombudsman is honest has a legal background and understands consumers interests well this system helps to get quick decisions instead of wasting time and resources in consumer courts
717022 the backlog in district consumer courts in cities such as mumbai is at least four to five years while the number is higher for state commissions he added
717023 the idea of having an ombudsman for our association is under consideration and it should be implemented in the next three months
717024 we realised that we were unable to attend a lot of consumer complaints and were getting feedback that we are arrogant
717025 to begin with the ombudsman will deal with complaints concerning our products
717026 we continue to grow our footprint in india by leveraging the talent pool available here
717027 generally power projects are highly leveraged and are 70 80 per cent debt funded
717028 hence the sector is highly susceptible to rising interest rates especially in the current scenario when all major players are undergoing expansion
717029 even though airlines have cut down over capacity by 15 per cent 30 per cent of seats are still flying empty
717030 the main challenge before airlines would be to sell these seats
717031 airlines do have fluctuating yield management to improve revenue and a flyer must know the best time to buy at the best price
717032 the fall is not on account of the stock market
717033 with zero interest finance options we have been bearing the load of the high interest rates and will have to continue with these as consumer spending is low in these inflationary times
717034 as major players have withdrawn companies are now left with only two private financiers bajaj auto finance and shriram finance
717035 interest costs for consumer durable manufacturers have risen but if rates continue to increase these might have to be passed on to the market
717036 so far we have managed to keep the finance options attractive for the consumers
717037 desktop virtualisation is a rapidly expanding new market with tremendous upside potential
717038 with around four crore internet subscribers in india there is a huge opportunity desktop virtualization is the next level of innovation at citrix
717039 youre not very nice and i dont think i like you youre not very nice cause you made me cry youre not very nice and i dont want to see you so why dont you just f ck off and die
717040 even better okay so i was totally on my way here and i would have been on time but then i saw this guy jogging down the street
717041 he was okay get this he was he was wearing a pink spandex running suit and okay are you ready for this a neon green fanny pack of all things
717042 so i followed him for a couple blocks you know to see if i wasnt hallucinating well turns out i wasnt
717043 there are two groups of people in the world those who believe that theworld can be divided into two groups of people and those who dont
717044 oh im just not the kind of person who goes to church
717045 transcending mystery and wonder affirmed in all cultures which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life
717046 we do not have to do anything we do not have to take care of ourselves by ourselves refuge is always there the spirit of life is always there the infinite spirit of love lifts us up
717047 youve reached the tardis the doctors not here at the moment as hes off saving the universe again with a bit of a help from his friends press 1 if you have a missing planet press 2 if youre offering banana daiquiris press 3 if youre returning from a parallel universe have a brilliant day

717056 that is just a taste of things to come especially if youre a fan of video services like hulu
717057 curiously representatives from other telecommunications companies praised the decision even though they objected to the commission meddling in how they manage their networks they said they would prefer such rulings to legislation from congress which has discussed enshrining net neutrality principles in the law
717058 a few people are using the lions share of our bandwidth were not allowed to block software like bittorrent used by these bandwidth hogs were not allowed to discriminate in any way so well have to charge by the megabyte instead so that costs will be fairly allocated and a few users dont spoil things for the rest of us it would be bad for our users to allow them to actually have unlimited internet access this plan doesnt discriminate against anyone
717059 we need policy to help cut a path for more competition rather than protecting incumbents a bandwidth competition act of 2008 not bogus net neutrality
717060 municipal or privately run wireless data services using wi fi or wimax should be sprouting like weeds
717061 a stroke of a pen can cure these ills incumbents be damned they will adjust i personally would climb telephone poles on my street to run fiber if i could get 100 megabit internet service any takers talk about an economic stimulus this is the type of infrastructure we need the stock market will fund it all as well as resolve overbuild problems
717062 and guess what the online video boom has taken its toll on the isp market as well with customers voting with their feet for better plans and as for all the metered packages that were all the rage just two or three years ago none of the big german isps are even advertising them anymore instead theyre trying to sell premium packages bundled with fast unmetered broadband access 1 amp 1 for example one of germanys biggest isps the company is now offering its customers a dsl package with 16mbit unlimited bandwidth and 100 movies on demand streamed to your pc for just 40 euros per month beats paying 30 per movie download doesnt it

717085 there shall be no private ownership of live animals classified in this act as big or trophy game animals or of any wolf or wolf hybrid
717086 to protect the public against health and safety risks that exotic animals pose to the community and to protect the welfare of the individual animals held in private possession
717087 knowingly transfer transport or possess in interstate or foreign commerce a confined exotic mammal for the purpose of allowing the killing or injuring of that animal for entertainment or the collection of a trophy
717088 this act is limited in its purpose and will not limit the licensed hunting of any native mammals or any native or exotic birds
717089 this is sensible legislation that is backed by responsible hunters animal protection advocates wildlife scientists environmentalists and zoological professionals the boone and crockett club and the izaak walton league of america nationally recognized hunting clubs have policy positions affirmatively opposing canned hunts in addition this legislation is supported by the humane society of the united states the doris day animal league the fund for animals and the animal protection institute
717090 every state in the country already has laws prohibiting inhumane conduct toward animals
717091 in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce knowingly transfers transports or possesses a confined exotic animal for the purposes of allowing the killing or injuring of that animal for entertainment or for the collection of a trophy
717092 must provide a transport tag for each large game animal killed in that area
717093 maine residents and out of state tourists are drawn to our special events and our wildlife and conservation education programming for children
717094 i am writing to you today to urge you to introduce and support legislation regarding a complete ban on commercial large game shooting areas in maine

717098 is no your turn to push the button is my turn to push the button
717099 i never even heard of that is it in english
717100 that the gall and vinegar or myrrhed wine offered to our saviour immediately before his crucifixion was in all probability a preparation of indian hemp marijuana and even speak of its earlier use in obstetrics
717101 being able to use mind games to control others i feel superior
717102 the problem is that with so many stands some in fairly close proximity to each other and possibly occupied by an inexperienced hunter who might become excited and shoot at anything that moves the risk of an accident is considered to be too great to allow hunters to pussy foot around on the ground
717103 the commissioner may issue a license under this chapter only to a person who operated a commercial large game shooting area during the period beginning october 1 1999 and ending march 15 2000 and only for the game offered for harvesting within that area during that time period
717104 you should be aware that the homestead lodge has not obtained approval from the maine land use regulation commission for the operation of such a commercial business as is required
717105 i had planned this five years ago and i am in hopes that you will issue me this license
717106 enclosed is a check for 1000 for the large game shooting area license
717107 i would greatly prefer to help the deer farming large game shooting industry to strengthen and thrive
717108 exempt a person from the provisions of chapter 739 to title 17 chapter 42 subchapter iii maines animal cruelty laws
717109 a person including an owner or the owners agent is guilty of cruelty to animals if that person kills or attempts to kill an animal by a method that does not cause instantaneous death
717110 the ethical sportsmanlike and lawful pursuit and taking of any free ranging wild native north american big game animal in a manner that does not give the hunter an improper advantage over such animals
717111 trophy animals placed in a harvest operation should exhibit their natural flight instinct
717112 no method of slaughtering or handling in connection with slaughtering shall be deemed to comply with the public policy of the united states unless it is humane
717113 chronic wasting disease cwd is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy tse affecting elk and deer cervids as well as moose in north america
717114 the infectious prion believed to cause chronic wasting disease seems to remain viable for years and can only be killed by incineration at temperatures exceeding 1 110 degrees or by a bleach bath
717115 experts fear that cwd may reach crisis levels due to its resistance to eradication
717116 some scientists including valerius geist theorize that deer in colorados research facility first contracted the disease through contact with scrapie infected sheep
717117 right now sportsmen are blessed with good access and use of both parks and public lands managed by the departments of conservation and inland fisheries and wildlife
717118 through education and presenting to others the values associated with such things as ethical hunting will do far more to preserve our good clean hunting heritage than cramming another law down the throats of people that will accomplish little if anything these are the tactics used by the anti hunting and animal rights crowd
717119 treading on the toes of ranchers and landowners by threatening their property rights is a sure way to instill bad relations between the outdoor sportsman and the landowner whom we all know without them we have less land to hunt on
717120 no one has an absolute right to use his land in a way that may harm the public health or welfare or that damages the quality of life of neighboring landowners or of the community as a whole
717121 prohibits a person from offering another person the opportunity to hunt wound or take any mammal that is intentionally confined tied staked caged or otherwise restrained from engaging in normal movement
717122 slaughtering a mammal for purposes of meat leather or fur production or humanely euthanizing a mammal for health safety or scientific purposes
717123 guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten thousand dollars nor more than twenty five thousand dollars
717124 the general assembly hereby finds determines and declares that this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace health and safety
717125 the licensee may not allow the shooting of game animals or alternative livestock
717126 while penned hunts are certainly unethical from a fair chase point of view the fact remains that not everyone adheres to the same set of ethics nor should they and since owning farming and killing elk in pens for pleasure does not directly infringe on the equal rights of others banning its practice is indeed a violation of the property rights of those ranchers it serves precedence over
717127 contrary to assertions made by game farmers in the weeks before the election i 143 would not constitute a violation or takings of private property rights
717128 advances legitimate non illusory state interest in protecting montana wildlife
717129 it is rational to claim that fee killing would have negative effects on montanas fair chase hunting ethic
717130 montana does have a legitimate interest in banning fee killing of game farm animals
717131 rather it is the mere shooting and killing of animals that lack any means of escape
717132 rendered insensible to pain by a single blow or gunshot or an electrical chemical or other means that is rapid and effective before being shackled hoisted thrown cast or cut or by slaughtering in accordance with the ritual requirements of the jewish faith or any other religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter
717133 the trend is described as a return to madness by skeptics or as a rational approach to unlimited opportunities presented by the internet by true believers greed fear and a desperate rush to pick the next big winner are all adding fuel to the fire that is silicon valleys resurgence
717134 think of the calories in sugar fat kills more people than anything else
717135 to j1 though it was up and down for me you have always been sticking to me really hard not letting me go through all alone no matter how dumb i seem most of the times
717136 this is how badly we need a young male native english speaker in this department

717148 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
717149 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
717150 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
717151 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
717152 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well
717153 no matter where i was i always knew two things you were thinking of me and if i got in a tight spot you would come for me if you were alive

717164 let the partners decide that for themselves whether it is made up of malay chinese malay indian chinese indian or even malay chinese indian
717165 power sharing is an important principle in bn we do not give 100 per cent to any one group we believe in fair distribution
717166 we once met a bumiputera businessman who applied for a government contract but we discovered he was only a front for a chinese company
717167 where mistakes were made in the past now is the time to correct them
717168 ive always encouraged contractors to expand and go overseas create a truly malaysian company and i will give you the support

717171 i used to have a lot of confidence in my stock market knowledge accumulated in years of investing in shares
717172 fund investors better lower their expectation of short term returns and choose bond funds to reduce the potential risks because companies growth potential has been largely factored into the current stock prices
717173 the market did not react to the slide in other markets and to cooling policies at home given this investors should stay even more cautious
717174 fifty years of the national relay race has been run and we have covered a good distance and achieved much

717198 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
717199 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta

717212 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
717213 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
717214 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
717215 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
717216 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
717217 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
717218 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
717219 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
717220 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
717221 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war

717226 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
717227 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
717228 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
717229 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done

717233 the vision is to figure out how to re establish the connection between individuals and their natural environments and reconnect families in the process
717234 think of the traffic and the noise and light until we know how many houses are being proposed its hard to know what the impact will be
717235 they own the land and they can do what they want with it
717236 we need a business to keep people here not drive people away
717237 its a little difficult when you dont have direct contact with the landowners
717238 this is a significant change whether you like it or not
717239 we want to be a good neighbor and partner and were trying to find ways to do that
717240 it is our money and we should be allowed to use it any way we want
717241 people are always quick to want individual choice but when it goes wrong and leads to bankruptcy they blame the government for doing nothing
717242 this is an atrocious idea life span is currently 82 how much more can it go up to
717243 come on give us singaporeans a break when will you the government stop intervening into how we spend or invest our own hard earned monies it aint yours
717244 in real life the picture here is less gloomy because the majority of retirees live with their children
717245 this will give me the choice to carry on working and earn my keep
717246 911 and that call gets passed off to emergency services the caller not realizing how bad it is to disconnect a call to the psap without saying anything hangs the phone up then the return calls and visits from the police ensue with less than hilarious results
717247 9 in front in other words you would have to dial 9911 to get emergency services i think that this solution would require stickers or labels on the phones to let people know how to place 911 calls in case of an emergency it seems a little risky to do it this way in a k 12 environment
717248 8 is already in use as a special prefix to access other services

717250 we are a small group who visited the project and were affected
717251 more importantly is that whatever we say is only written in code not stone and is aimed to be revised updated alive
717252 the survey shows that malaysians clearly know what they want to do when they retire but the majority are not actively planning for their retirement
717253 when malaysians stop working they want to travel spend time with the family and be more involved with the community financial security is crucial to fulfil these dreams
717254 however it is startling to learn from our survey that only 34 of malaysians are putting money aside regularly for their retirement funds
717255 they believe that they just save as much as they can now and hope that they would have enough to cover their retirement needs
717256 they were willing to take a hit elsewhere to make the olympics look good
717257 every olympics that has ever been held in the far east has been befuddled by ratings problems
717258 i think this may be the most watched games in years
717259 without that you really cant capture the colour that is so vital behind the scenes
717260 strategy expresses its logic in rational linear terms ends ways and means
717261 strategy is fundamentally about choices it reflects a preference for a future state or condition and determines how best to get there
717262 the steps in strategic planning thus should be thought of as layered on top of each other and the strategist should move among them freely gradually sharpening assumptions analysis and plans as the work proceeds
717263 in the cold war we faced an empire that wanted more land and power but had no intrinsic discernible bloodlust now we face a movement that seeks psychological dominance and is hungry for blood then we faced a large bloc of countries whose influence had to be contained now we face not a state but a transnational network with no fixed address a vine to be ripped up in numerous countries while leaving those countries as unharmed as possible
717264 historical record shows that hegemony never has been a winning strategy
717265 could be the most important reformation of us grand strategy in over 1 2 a century
717266 no longer sufficient to contain w o seeking to reform authoritarian regimes
717267 ultimately depends on not standing alone because it claims to be pursing values that are true for every person in every society
717268 the bush administration has made too few efforts to use diplomacy
717269 the new jacobins have taken full advantage of the nations outrage over 9 11 to advance their already fully formed drive for empire
717270 the first president bush thought of himself as a competent pragmatist but as is often the case with persons who lack philosophically grounded convictions of their own he was susceptible to adopting the language and ideas of intellectually more focused and ideological individuals
717271 the persistence of authoritarianism anywhere can breed resentments that can provoke terrorism that can do us grievous harm
717272 other powers prefer a single hegemon as long as it is a relatively benign one
717273 for as was the case through most of the cold war theres something worse out there than american hegemony
717274 the united states must defend liberty and justice because these pricniples are right and true for all people everywhere
717275 these non negotiable demands of human dignity are protected most securely in democracies

717300 maaf pesta kemarin pasti kurang menyenangkan apa boleh buat yang terjadi adalah masalah teknis beribu maaf

717303 bisa sekalian dekorasi dan baju para pagar bagus dan pagar ayu
717304 memang selalu ada orang yang ingin menjadi pengantin tapi bilang minta didandani seperti make up biasa saja mungkin karena keterbatasan biaya

717309 well be trying to get his thing done and work on a few things on my own project
717310 lots of producers have hits but he does far more than that hes a creator who has moved popular culture three times with gangsta rap g funk and eminem
717311 when we started aftermath we had something like 20 artists and it was driving me crazy
717312 i couldnt sit down and focus on any of it plus it was doubly hard because you ended up crushing these peoples dreams when you had to let them go
717313 people are always coming up to me thinking ive got some magic wand that can make them a star and i want to tell them that no one can do that
717314 making hit records is not that easy but it took me time to realize that myself
717315 the actual making of a record is the most exciting part of this business
717316 i dont make records so i can sit down afterward and listen to them i make them so other people can sit down and listen to them
717317 i was mainly interested in how he responded to directions
717318 thats always an important test with me talent gets you in the door but there are other things i consider like do i want to work with this guy can we click can we laugh and talk in the studio if not id rather work with someone else
717319 id probably take the song and then have him sit out in the lobby while i worked on it
717320 i did sports at school and all but when i got home it was just music everybody in my neighborhood loved music i could jump the back fence and be in the park where there were ghetto blasters everywhere
717321 we couldnt have done anything more unlikely in music business terms we were making a record that we knew no one would play on the radio because of the language and that no major label would even release
717322 there is some sampling on my records and a lot of what i call replays where id have musicians come in the studio and replay the sample from the original record
717323 i cant even remember why he was in jail but i thought his voice would be perfect for the song
717324 so i told him to stay on the line while i duct taped the receiver of the phone to the microphone
717325 one of the most important things for a producer is to realize you dont know everything
717326 i love having people in the studio that i can feed off and who can feed off each other
717327 its great when everybody is working together and feels something is happening
717328 thats when its all smiles in the studio you dont want to see any clock or any daylight or hear any phone you just cut yourself off from the rest of the world and make music
717329 i dont necessarily even call it work i call it fun i even like the pressure it makes me work all the harder if i know people out there are waiting for the record
717330 the way he puts together certain words and the way he makes certain words rhyme that to me most of the time dont even seem like they are supposed to rhyme i also loved the fact that eminem i think was setting out to be shocking i love it as dark as it can get and i thought the public would feel the same way
717331 dre showed me how to do things with my voice that i didnt know i could do
717332 he had so much authority and strength in his voice
717333 i told them i love working with both you guys
717334 it was more like what is going to be the best move under the circumstances i dont even remember who came up with the idea of putting game on geffen but it was absolutely not me picking 50 over him
717335 i go in the gym two to 2 1 2 hours monday through friday it makes me feel better and look better
717336 i feel like i can kick a brick wall down now
717337 i was really hoping to have it out this year but its going to have to be pushed back a while because of some other things ive got to work on
717338 when i think of the future i think a lot of quincy jones and how he is an inspiration
717339 look at the quality of his work over so many years he didnt even make his best record thriller until he was 50
717340 that gives me something to look forward to nothing pulls you back into the studio more than the belief that your best record is still ahead
717341 pressure build up in a small sealed sample bottle in a storage safe resulted in plutonium contamination of a storage room at about 02 30 00 30 gmt no one was working in the laboratory at the time

717513 the revival of the analytical principles of classical political economy that has gathered pace since the mid 1960s has been based on the firm foundation of a logically coherent theory of value and distribution it was the failure to provide this foundation which for many years confined the classical approach to being at best a repository of useful ideas on growth and technological progress smiths discussion of the division of labour and marxs dissection of the labour process being good examples or at worst identified with simple minded devotion of the labour theory of value as the qualitative expression of capitalist exploitation the position to which hilferding retreated in the face of critique of marx so depriving the surplus approach of any quantitative significance as a theory of value and distribution the publication of piero sraffas production of commodities by means of commodities changed all that sraffa not only generalized the mathematical solutions to the surplus approach which had been advanced by dmitriev and bortkeiwicz but also presented the analytical structure of the surplus approach with stark clarity moreover sraffa produced a critique of the neo classical theory of the rate of profit and so of the entire neo classical explanation of value distribution and output hence clearing the ground for the redevelopment of classical theory with the analytical core now secure attention can be turned to the development of other facets of classical and marxian theory and to the empirical insights which this theory provides in stark contrast to the neo classical approach which reduces all economic activity to a single principle the competitive resolution of individual attempts to maximize utility subject to the constraints of technology and endowment classical theory is constructed from a number of analytically separable components the core of the theory the surplus approach to value and distribution takes as data the size and composition of output the technology in use the conditions of reproduction and the real wage or in some cases the rate of profit these data do not however lie outside the realm of economics as for example the neo classical economists utility functions do we need to provide theoretical explanations of their determination hence smith ricardo and marx advanced theories of the real wage and of the level of output says law in the case of ricardo and smith and marx presented detailed analyses of technological change assembled around the core these theories are the building blocks of a general theory of the operations of the capitalist economy there is in all this a clear danger of constructing a disjointed ad hoc collage of theories and empirical generalisations this is avoided by enveloping the entire edifice in a general characterisation of the economic system the clear specification that is of the capitalist mode of production this serves both to cement the elements of the theory together and to eliminate propositions that do not fit broadly there are two jobs to be done in developing and extending the classical framework first the classical theory itself must be developed and generalised all the elements surrounding the core analysis of value and distribution theories of output and employment of accumulation of technology of the wage of competition and so on require restatement and modernisation in the light both of sraffas results and of the many changing facets of the modern capitalist system this will involve both theoretical development and empirical analysis for one of the important characteristics of classical theorising is the manner in which theory is grounded in the socio economic data of the system under consideration the institutional environment is an essential part of the theory second the rejection of the now discredited neoclassical theory throws open a wide range of problems in international trade development economics fiscal and monetary policy and so forth into which the classical approach can provide new insights in part these will lead to the refreshing task of debunking the policy prescriptions of orthodox theory which revolve primarily around the fundamental theorem of welfare economics and the supposed efficiency of competitive markets but there is also a positive job to be done the reconstruction of economic theory will inevitably precipitate a reinterpretation of economic policy and problems

717572 it is a bit too late to get into the nitty gritty now one can only hope that leander and mahesh get there without any injury problems their vast experience is surely a big plus point if they get seeded that will also be a help
717573 they needed to play at least four five weeks a one off event is not going to be beneficial this is not a davis cup tie where you play one doubles match
717574 i think they had their best chance in athens this year its going to be tough
717575 they need a good draw if they could reach the quarterfinals from there on anything is possible
717576 they are older now if anything with age comes slower reflex a key factor in doubles but they are playing well on the international tour they know each other
717577 the good thing is they are playing well individually i know for sure that mahesh is really hungry for a medal i hope it doesnt affect him
717578 sania is quite capable and hope she gets a lucky break

717626 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
717627 to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
717628 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
717629 we deeply appreciate and value senator obamas perspective on this important issue
717630 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24th as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

717633 there were all kinds of press there nobody reported it as a racial comment nobody certainly said what rick davis just said that he called john mccain a racist the only time this became an issue was when rick davis and their campaign decided to kick it up and make it a racial issue and thats exactly what theyve been running a negative campaign for weeks

717640 it is now completely clear to me that he as is proved by his cranial formation and his hair descends from the negroes from egypt assuming that his mother or grandmother had not interbred with a nigger now this union of judaism and germanism with a basic negro substance must produce a peculiar product the obtrusiveness of the fellow is also nigger like
717641 being in his quality as a nigger a degree nearer to the rest of the animal kingdom than the rest of us he is undoubtedly the most appropriate representative of that district
717642 is it a misfortune that magnificent california was seized from the lazy mexicans who did not know what to do with it
717643 in america we have witnessed the conquest of mexico and have rejoiced at it it is to the interest of its own development that mexico will be placed under the tutelage of the united states
717644 i have supported hundreds of pieces of legislation which would help americans obtain an equal opportunity in america i am proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of dr martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination in any shape or form in america today
717645 in arizona a bill to recognize a holiday honoring mlk failed in the legislature so then gov bruce babbitt a democrat declared one through executive order in january 1987 the first act of arizonas new governor republican evan mecham was to rescind the executive order by his predecessor to create an mlk holiday arizonas stance became a national controversy mccain backed the decision at the time
717646 in a vote likely to haunt him for the rest of his public career mccain voted against 1983 legislation establishing the third monday in january as the federal holiday marking kings birthday back home in arizona he supported gov evan mechams decision in 1987 to rescind an executive order creating a state holiday for king but later reversed his position
717647 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields family spokesman glenn tunstead told abc radio last week
717648 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing
717649 the family are still doing things very tough a day doesnt go by where its not spoken about and looked at he said
717650 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use
717651 is there any way that obama could be more perfect
717652 if john mccain feels that i can help his candidacy which i think its so important to elect him our next president i will do it
717653 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama im going to go there really talking about why i support john mccain and why i hope a lot of other independents and democrats will do that and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as partisan mud slingers
717654 jesse jackson was an important figure paving the way for osama bin laden to appear
717655 it has not done anything to address the energy problem and its actually spent heavily on you know financing climate skeptics on basically blocking intelligent policy on muddying the waters of our debate
717656 if jimmy carter had actually managed to sell us on energy conservation 30 years ago we would be in a lot better shape than we are right now
717657 with the price of a gallon of gas up 2 50 since george bush was sworn in why would anybody trust a republican to do the right thing on prices at the pump drilling or the profit that exxonmobil just declared for the second quarter 11 680 000 000
717658 eight years ago the average price of a gallon of gas was 1 47 and now its 3 95 eight years ago exxonmobils second quarter earnings were 4 015 000 000 today that company announced second quarter earnings that are the highest in u s corporate history a record breaking 11 680 000 000 amazing what happens when two former oilmen are in charge of the country how in the heck did we not see that coming
717659 now whether you know bush is responsible for high oil prices i dont think you can make that case but we should remember that he promised he said back in 2000 that he had he knew what to do he would be able to talk opec into opening the spigots and you know they havent managed to do that so this is a failed energy policy for sure
717660 pretty good in saying the oil drilling plan is nonsense
717661 oh no they dont do i mean if you want to you know the reason to hate exxon is not that it makes so much money per se its the fact that it has not done anything to address the energy problem and its actually spent heavily on you know financing climate skeptics on basically blocking intelligent policy on muddying the waters of our debate now whether we could have you know to be fair we dont have lots of sugarcane so we couldnt really have done it as easily as the brazilians did but we could you know if jimmy carter had actually managed to sell us on energy conservation 30 years ago we would be in a lot better shape than we are right now
717662 i think hes falling into the kind of mistake that i would tend to make which is saying you know this is silly this is ridiculous nobody is going to believe that and thats not good enough and i think hes got to look when i read obamas response to the mccain ad about you know prices at the pump obamas response was you know this is the same old politics which is true but you know he was being dismissive obama was being dismissive when he ought to be outraged hes got to do something this is an outrage this guy is insulting your intelligence hes really doing bad stuff and you shouldnt be taken in by this not just sort of oh well you know i think this was obama being a little bit too much of a professor if i can say that
717663 you know this is silly this is ridiculous nobody is going to believe that
717664 this is an outrage this guy is insulting your intelligence hes really doing bad stuff and you shouldnt be taken in by this
717665 if jimmy carter had actually managed to sell us on energy conservation 30 years ago we would be in a lot better shape than we are right now
717666 now whether you know bush is responsible for high oil prices i dont think you can make that case but we should remember that he promised he said back in 2000 that he had he knew what to do he would be able to talk opec into opening the spigots and you know they havent managed to do that so this is a failed energy policy for sure
717667 will talking to people like these debating them providing facts to counter their assertions ever make the slightest bit of difference
717668 of course theyll vote republican where else are they going to go
717669 theres nothing at the end of the rainbow theres nothing to grow up for anymore
717670 i usually try to get a sense of how well shes pushing and if shes pushing effectively i just let her do what shes going to do

717672 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
717673 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
717674 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
717675 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
717676 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
717677 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
717678 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come

717680 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
717681 hadnt obama already caved on the drilling issue when she was interviewed by stephanopoulos
717682 why the hell didnt they storm the bus and shoot the bastard in the head

717691 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
717692 the country is fascinated with black and white but what about brown
717693 its underestimated undervalued and it has the power to decide the election our vote counts the same as their vote
717694 my message is that i personally am for barack obama and if you are thats great but more importantly it should be a fair election and people should vote
717695 too many states are decided not by the people that turn out but by the people that dont turn out the fact that more people vote for american idol than for president of the united states is just incredibly wrong
717696 like wimbledon fortnight but without the aesthetic or entertainment value the annual breakdown of the round of trade talks is becoming a summer ritual
717697 the greatest expansions of world trade have tended to come not from the bloodless t ntonnement of some fictional walrasian auctioneer but from the barrel of a maxim gun the edge of a scimitar or the ferocity of nomadic horsemen
717698 each era can be seen as one in which trade is conducted within a geopolitical framework established by the previous major war or conflict that is in turn altered by the outbreak of the next war setting the stage for the next epoch and so on it is natural to suspect that the accumulating economic and geopolitical tensions unleashed in the course of each period of peace prosperity and trade culminate in successive rounds of conflict so that wars rather than being exogenous or external shocks to the world system have been inherent in its very nature as it has evolved over the past millennium
717699 we dont have any doubts that the club is working hard to get a solution to this matter
717700 well have to see whats going to happen we always knew that it was going to be a complicated matter it will obviously not be easy for him to come to madrid but put the question to any football coach and all of them would say theyd love to have a player like ronaldo
717701 even in 1998 when we had problems with milosevic mccain did everything that we asked of him to the benefit of the albanian people including arming the kla
717702 we are american albanians and we need a leader who will strengthen this country we must support john mccain because he did everything we asked of him for kosovo from supporting the kosovo liberation army to supporting the independence of kosovo two years ago he spoke in brussels and said that independence is the only solution
717703 joe i saw your people in michigan and in south carolina and in new hampshire
717704 we would hope to be able to find sources but whether we will or not i dont know we do get animals that are donated but not enough
717705 we dont believe theres any genuine reason why this source of animals should be stopped
717706 certainly if we lose these sources then our education system will suffer without a doubt
717707 we wouldnt be using them if we could do the same training in an alternative way
717708 virtually everywhere in europe an america they use alternatives which they say are good if not better
717709 you obviously dont operate on healthy humans so why do it on animals
717710 my view is that using animals for scientific testing isnt something we can continue to support
717711 there are more than 3500 policies that will be reviewed and changed
717712 users on facebook come from wealthier homes and are more likely to attend college myspace users tend to get a job after finishing high school rather than continue their education

717717 i would think john would never make it a litmus test but when it comes down to a nominee selecting a vice presidential running mate its their decision exclusively
717718 and i would respect that decision one way or another
717719 i think at the end of the day i think the party would be comfortable with someone sen mccain was comfortable with and that is ultimately his decision
717720 i would have that conversation with my friend john and report back to you

717750 perhaps it is because feminists are still so busy cataloging past slights to hillary that they have failed to mount a vivid defense of michelle obama who has taken over from hillary as the one conservatives like to paint as a harridan
717751 barack obama will require you to work he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you put down your divisions that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones that you push yourselves to be better and that you engage barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed

717757 this 20 year plan will be developed in conjunction with local government
717758 our national infrastructure plan will include up to 1 5 billion in crown investment for an ultra fast broadband network connecting 75 of new zealanders and thats why we will double the broadband challenge fund and refocus it on rural communities
717759 our national infrastructure plan will also include a new category of state highway we will call these roads of national significance these roads of national significance will be singled out as essential roads that require priority treatment this would include for example state highway 1 the essential backbone of new zealands roading network
717760 nationals new priority consenting process will streamline consents for major national infrastructure
717761 first we will introduce infrastructure bonds secondly we will make greater use of public private partnerships these new financing and asset management techniques will open up infrastructure to a wide range of financial investors this will include kiwi mums and dads through their super funds and kiwisaver accounts

717921 the false selling of the iraq war we were railroaded into an unnecessary war
717922 no president of the united states should employ distortion of truth to take the nation to war
717923 the bush administration convinced a substantial majority of americans before the war that saddam hussein was somehow linked to 9 11 inexcusably selling the false iraq al qaeda claim to americans
717924 the president and his top advisers did not allow the american people or even congress to have the information necessary to make reasoned judgments of their own its obvious that the bush administration misled americans about mr husseins weapons and his terrorist connections

718048 this indonesian war epic from rapi studios the people who brought us the devils sword plays at some times with the slanted melodrama of a vintage american ww ii pic and at others with the irony and emotional intensity of sam fuller on top of his game
718049 what sets this one apart is its realized ambition this is no b movie diversion this is a sweat dripping labor of love it has an ensemble cast which includes but in no way defers to the best known action star of indonesias film boom of the nineteen eighties barry prima its notable that prima played the comic book folk hero fighting the dutch colonials in the early nineteenth century crowd pleaser the warrior here he fights them a century later with guns and grenades rather than sorcery and swords he gives a fine performance as a character not a hero the heroism in this film is shared by many including a thief reformed by his thirst for revenge and at least two women who fight in completely credible roles with at least as much grit as the men in the film

718085 there are these two theories one is called evolution the other is called genesis
718086 although richards not really old enough to be up there with david atten borough is he
718087 god created the chicken and the chicken laid the egg
718088 to have him teaching science at a respectable school is about equivalent to having a flat earther teaching geography
718089 could be discussed in schools in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
718090 what is not fine is to say there are these two theories one is called evolution the other is called genesis if you are going to say that then you should talk about the nigerian tribe who believe the world was created from the excrement of ants
718091 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
718092 i was shocked by how some put up barriers to understanding
718093 i showed them the evidence and they just said this is what it says in my holy book and so i asked if your holy book says one thing but the evidence says something else you then go with your holy book and they said yes and i said why and they said its the way weve been brought up
718094 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with
718095 the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multi culturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing

718102 when i go to dinner with a bishop i find them very often extremely often very convivial nice people why ever not
718103 often when you talk to bishops it appears they dont believe in very much
718104 it would appear he does believe in it the virgin birth
718105 but he doesnt thrust it down peoples throats his kind of anglicanism is benign and pretty harmless
718106 because we are all brought up to respect faith it leaves open a gap through which fanatics can charge
718107 yes i think we have all been brought up to give too much respect to religion as opposed to any other kind of opinion
718108 well we devote our lives to writing books composing music creating poetry all higher functions of the brain if we were following darwinian dictates we males would be spending all our time fighting other males to get females and screwing them all over the place in order to have lots of children and grandchildren im very glad we have risen above all of that
718109 the god delusion a bestseller that picks apart the inconsistencies in religion with scalpel like logic
718110 its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
718111 williamss line is that evolution is all well and good but that god was responsible for it
718112 we are all brought up to respect faith it leaves open a gap through which fanatics can charge

718147 con el an lisis de la legislaci n estadounidense queremos definir una estrategia que nos permita pasos legales para dar participaci n a las v ctimas en los procesos que se adelantan contra los extraditados
718148 si el narcotr fico financi estos delitos las v ctimas tienen derechos que se deben concretar y divulgar y exigir su cumplimiento
718149 queremos dar una mano a las v ctimas por eso desde la extradici n a estados unidos el 7 de mayo de alias macaco empezamos a estudiar con atenci n la legislaci n de estados unidos proceso que aceleramos ahora con la extradici n de 14 paramilitares

718151 se est contando que cada uno de ellos es equiparable a un augusto pinochet
718152 es necesario que se conozcan los graves delitos cometidos por ellos que se divulgue que tienen una gran deuda con colombia y millones de colombianos para que no sean presentados como simples narcotraficantes
718153 cada una por su carril confluir n en el cumplimiento de nuestro objetivo

718180 pirates get enough of a taste of the game to see if they like the content but if they want to experience it in non buggy fashion they need to buy it legitimately those issues werent communicated clearly and as such the subset of pirates who use such means to sample content before purchase were clearly turned off

718195 i do not think any single organization or any single meeting is going to solve all these problems
718196 but i think every organization and every meeting should try to make a direct contribution and that is what the saarc leaders have pledged themselves to do together and that is what we as observers are trying to work with them to do
718197 this summit has rekindled the hope and belief among our peoples regarding the delivery and prosperity that we collectively promised 23 years ago

718206 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
718207 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
718208 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
718209 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
718210 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
718211 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
718212 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
718213 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
718214 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
718215 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
718216 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
718217 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
718218 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
718219 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
718220 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
718221 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

718228 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
718229 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
718230 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
718231 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

718235 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
718236 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
718237 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
718238 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
718239 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
718240 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
718241 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
718242 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
718243 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
718244 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
718245 despite what she sees as an overwhelming and urgent situation ian is still at home and shes counting the days until he gets an inpatient assessment at the childrens hospital of eastern ontario
718246 what kind of a life is that to be locked up in a house we need a life he needs a life too he needs help i know this might mean he cant live with us and that devastates me i cant tell you how many times ive been in tears
718247 i love my son hes the most precious thing to me in the world if this is what we have to do its going to tear me apart but i know he could potentially kill someone and i cant put him in that situation
718248 what this is going to do to the future of my son is astronomical
718249 his symptoms were communications and they escalated the longer it took for us to understand he was trying to get our attention in any way possible
718250 when an autistic child or adult does not have sufficiently fluent expressive verbal speech finding establishing and making use of a reliable trusted and acknowledged alternative mode of expressive communication is job 1 i think that the lions share of maladaptive behavior in autistic individuals is due to the unavailability of reliable trusted and acknowledged expressive speech to mitigate a source of distress or to communicate a want or need or fear
718251 i think that the lions share of maladaptive behavior in autistic individuals is due to the unavailability of reliable trusted and acknowledged expressive communication to mitigate a source of distress or to communicate a want or need or fear
718252 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
718253 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
718254 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
718255 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
718256 a glimmer of hope is that weve moderated some of those input costs
718257 theres a difference between 147 a barrel crude oil and 127 a barrel crude oil
718258 i think every fed official would be likely to conclude that inflation pressures would be in danger of rebounding if the economy started to come back
718259 the amount of cleanup left to do likely depends on house prices
718260 i think its premature to conclude that the worst is over for the housing market
718261 investors are going to be very wary of any indication of further deterioration in the labor market
718262 the market feels broadly like it is in a stabilization process
718263 volatility continues and probably will but it feels as though much of the bad news on the economy although it is continuing may already be reflected in the level of share prices
718264 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
718265 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
718266 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
718267 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
718268 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
718269 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
718270 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
718271 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
718272 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
718273 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
718274 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
718275 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
718276 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
718277 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
718278 who are open to doing something on the production side
718279 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
718280 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
718281 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
718282 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
718283 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
718284 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
718285 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
718286 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
718287 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
718288 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
718289 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
718290 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
718291 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
718292 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
718293 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
718294 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
718295 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
718296 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
718297 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
718298 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
718299 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
718300 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
718301 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
718302 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
718303 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
718304 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
718305 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
718306 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
718307 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
718308 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
718309 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
718310 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
718311 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
718312 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
718313 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
718314 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
718315 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
718316 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
718317 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
718318 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
718319 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
718320 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
718321 this is what happens when you turn fans of the game who just happen to be press loose on the devs
718322 by now enough water has gone under the christian spiritual formation bridge that we can give some assessment of where we have come and what yet needs to be done
718323 in reality islam is a revolutionary ideology and programme which seeks to alter the social order of the whole world and rebuild it in conformity with its own tenets and ideals muslim is the title of that international revolutionary party organized by islam to carry into effect its revolutionary programme and jihad refers to that revolutionary struggle and utmost exertion which the islamic party brings into play to achieve this objective

718329 i do not think any single organization or any single meeting is going to solve all these problems
718330 but i think every organization and every meeting should try to make a direct contribution and that is what the saarc leaders have pledged themselves to do together and that is what we as observers are trying to work with them to do
718331 this summit has rekindled the hope and belief among our peoples regarding the delivery and prosperity that we collectively promised 23 years ago
718332 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if found to be guilty they will be brought to justice
718333 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
718334 i have not done all that i wished to do
718335 i have not seen all that i wish to see
718336 ich denke dass wir sehr gut gespielt haben ich habe b lle gegen die stange und latte gesehen auch der lask hatte eine sehr gute chance in der ersten spielh lfte es ist normal dass wenn man das spiel macht es immer ein oder zwei m glichkeiten f r den gegner anm gibt aber wir haben vier f nf sechs sieben sehr gef hrliche m glichkeiten gehabt es ist kein problem wenn wir drei oder vier tore machen kann der gegner auch eines machen
718337 ich denke es war ein wichtiges tor wir sind froh ber die drei punkte es war heute eine gute antwort auf die kritik ich bin selbstkritisch genug um einzusch tzen ob ich gut gespielt habe oder nicht wenn ich jedes match drei tore machen w rde w rde ich ja bei manchester spielen es war ein sehr schwieriges spiel gegen den tabellenf hrer der sehr organisiert begonnen hat man kann zufrieden sein mit den drei punkten es war auch verdient heute
718338 wir haben mehrere m glichkeiten gehabt es hat aber der letzte pass gefehlt das war nicht konsequent genug insgesamt muss ich zufrieden sein hier ist es nicht einfach wir haben die r ume sehr eng gemacht schnell nach vorne gespielt wir h tten in der zweiten h lfte etwas ruhiger spielen und uns schneller bewegen m ssen
718339 eine aktion wo man ein bisschen vergisst und dann ist es sofort ein tor
718340 ich werde mich nicht f r etwas entschuldigen f r das das ioc nicht verantwortlich ist
718341 wir sind nicht f r das internet in china zust ndig
718342 es hat eine verbesserung gegeben das ist beispiellos in diesem land
718343 ich bin sicher dass am 9 august am tag nach der er ffnungsfeier nur noch die magie der spiele und die tadellose organisation z hlen
718344 er hat gro e schmerzen es sieht nicht gut aus
718345 seine parteisch digenden aufrufe zur nichtwahl der spd in zukunft zu unterlassen
718346 ich lasse mich nicht festlegen wann wie und wo ich zuk nftig meine meinung u ern werde
718347 es geht doch nicht darum dass ich da mal irgendwo einen kommentar geschrieben habe zu dem ich auch jederzeit stehe sondern es geht in wahrheit um den kurs der spd
718348 die reformen die wir gemeinsam mit wolfgang clement durchgesetzt haben haben in der spd viele wunden gerissen die werden aber nicht rascher verheilen wenn clement die spd verlassen muss
718349 dass auf der n chsten ebene eine einvernehmliche l sung erreicht wird
718350 das ist ein reines ablenkungsman ver mit dem ziel sich wichtig zu machen und streit in die spd zu tragen
718351 at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so i cant complain
718352 it was not as bad as it could have been and not as good either
718353 its just unfortunate i was the one to get a puncture and it was a case of oh no not again
718354 i had it several times last year and thats what lost me the championship
718355 but my lead is bigger now and you would never have thought that with all that has gone on this year
718356 it was a tough day and one well probably learn from
718357 ferrari were strong although if we had been out in front then it perhaps would have been a little different
718358 but they showed some really strong pace which we knew they had its just you guys the media that seem to think there is a huge difference
718359 we had a little bit of luck on our side but it doesnt feel any worse
718360 the team knew the potential was there but we just havent been able to nail it on a sunday
718361 but we just kept our focus worked logically to improve and were heading in the right direction
718362 the race just shows you how close its going to be until the end of the season and we just have to keep pushing our development
718363 we have new parts coming all the time and im confident we will be able to join the fight but it will be close all the time
718364 heikki drove superbly scoring his first victory in fine style and converting his excellent qualifying pace which has been apparent all season into a thoroughly well deserved win
718365 from lewiss perspective as bad days go it could have been a lot worse
718366 cred c l c tu o s conteze pe mine la returul cu turcii o s ne calific m galatasaray e sub roma pe care steaua a b tut o
718367 ive tried to be me throughout my whole period of england captain whether in the dressing room or with the press
718368 one of the things that has really hurt me in the last six to eight months is that i havent really been me at home and i guess thats why ive come to this decision i want to be me again i just hope you respect that
718369 we live in a country where we can all become a bit cynical and i felt myself getting that way
718370 thats why i felt it was the right time to move on i dont want to become a cynical old man i want to be that fresh optimistic guy ive always been
718371 i know there are people who say i should carry on but theyre not inside my head i bat best on instinct i captained best on instinct and now instinct told me now was the time to move on
718372 its been the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest the hardest in that im giving away the job ive loved for five years and put my heart and soul into but its also the easiest as my mind told me to pack it in i felt if i kept on going my career could come to an abrupt end and this decision will hopefully prolong it its a weight off my shoulders i believe there are a lot more runs in me and this decision will help that
718373 this is a big decision and i need a few weeks just to get away from the game and finish the season off with yorkshire
718374 i know now that im back in the ranks with all the other players that ive to get runs to get back into the team my body is working well but my mind isnt working as well and thats important at top level sport
718375 the one regret i have is that i didnt stand in front of them and tell them on saturday after the game i just didnt have it in me to say it to them wed just lost a big match and they were completely gutted and i didnt want them to give them something else to be unhappy about i spoke to a number of them this morning they were disappointed but they could respect it from my point of view
718376 dup ce a ie it bratu to i vroiau s marcheze
718377 nu mi e team de rapid mi e team de buz u este un meci greu i trebuie s facem 6 puncte mai nt i trebuie s c tig m cu buz ul pentru c este foarte important iar apoi ne vom g ndi i la rapid
718378 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

718395 mohammed and his family like many palestinians have suffered greatly because of the circumstances under which they live in gaza he himself was nearly killed by a bulldozer in the course of photographing the demolition of a neighbor s house and one of his brothers did lose his life as a teenager as a result of being shot by israel defense forces on his way home from school another brother was shot in the leg which had to be amputated mohammed s father has spent 11 years in israeli prisons where torture as is well known is common and in march 2003 mohammed returned to his home after school to find that he had it been demolished by an israeli bulldozer all his family s possessions books photographs all his own notebooks everything were obliterated and he and his family suddenly found themselves homeless it is not an unusual family story for people living in gaza on the contrary one hears accounts like this all the time from the lips of palestinians

718407 well i know you didnt ask for a history of the human species well work our way through that slowly as we have been doing but this part you do need to know that the kind of people i mentioned mostly men but a few females as well always feel they should be the leaders of our societies our countries our planet even either the leaders of record you might say or acting behind the scenes to arrange things for their own benefit and in pursuit of that goal they will do anything they have to steal lie plot nasty schemes even kill others actions which those of us who have a more civilized sort of brain more advanced more human are very very reluctant to do most people throughout our history as far as we can tell have been fairly decent sorts and have tried to make a good community or society to live in for they and their children most people want to look after themselves and their families and their communities as well they understand that if everybody is looked after then they are looked after too if everyone around them is safe from fear and hunger then they are safe too

718412 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields family spokesman glenn tunstead told abc radio last week
718413 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing
718414 the family are still doing things very tough a day doesnt go by where its not spoken about and looked at he said
718415 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use

718430 we dont believe theres any genuine reason why this source of animals should be stopped

718432 we wouldnt be using them if we could do the same training in an alternative way
718433 virtually everywhere in europe an america they use alternatives which they say are good if not better

718477 the ideal would have been for the council to consult widely on means and ways of introducing subscription of journalists rather than springing a surprise
718478 information available to keja indicates that the decision to levy the shs 2 000 is a means for the council to raise funds for its operations while this is not an entirely bad thing questions arise as to what specific services the council would be providing granted that the functions of the council are specified in the act what journalists are calling for is an explicit explanation of what they will expect from the council
718479 to our knowledge the council is yet to appoint a secretary or chief executive and members of the complaints commission yet these besides council members are the key organs envisaged in the media act 2007 we insist that these appointments must be made transparently before journalists can be reasonably expected to support the council in any of its activities

718483 if you have commercial attractions like theme parks local people may often go there but theres a lot more to a city than that like local cultural events that people might just ignore because they take them for granted
718484 this is the first time that the city has actively called on new yorkers to discover their backyard
718485 but fox 5 picked it up new york 1 picked it up our ceo was on bloomberg radio it seems to be a message thats very relevant

718612 in a nation in which 66 of the voting age population is overweight and 32 is obese could sen obamas skinniness be a liability despite his visits to waffle houses ice cream parlors and greasy spoon diners around the country his slim physique just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them

718646 his tattoos mostly amount to groups of short parallel lines and their purpose may be related to their locations the back and leg tattoos coincide with typical acupuncture points for treating back and leg pain interestingly they also coincide with areas where otzi as he was nicknamed showed evidence of osteoarthritis but the prevailing theory about acupuncture says that it originated in china only about 2 000 to 3 000 years ago so either acupuncture is much more ancient than previously thought which seems likely or his tattoos were not therapeutic at all but perhaps used as an ethnic identifier a good luck charm or were simply body art

718661 do not depend on the hope of results when you are doing an apostolic work you may have to face the fact that your work will be apparently worthless and even achieve no result at all if not perhaps results opposite to that you expect as you get used to this idea you start more and more to concentrate not on the results but on the value the rightness the truth of the work itself and there too a great deal has to be gone through as gradually you struggle less and less for an idea and more and more for specific people the range tends to narrow down but it gets much more real in the end it is the reality of personal relationships that saves everything

718924 if someone delays buying a house that would produce rent savings to hold out for a better price the delay would mean losing those savings and the loss could be compounded if prices went up instead

718933 the tax credit of up to 7 500 offered by the bill to first time homebuyers is actually a no interest loan collins said so about two years after taking this credit homeowners will have to start paying it back which could add another 500 a year to their property tax bill she said

719151 i have been on this site for several weeks now and the views shared here have challenged me greatly i was wondering if some of the de cons might answer a couple questions
719152 a text list i would like to see the thumbnails like in the front page
719153 never has this much sediment been released at once into such an active and hungry river
719154 marmot is certainly one of the best documented and most spectacular examples of dam removal in the sense that the river was allowed to process the material itself
719155 that is a very different river system h said the dam was built in 1913 to generate power but pge decided in 1999 that updating it to help declining fish runs would cost more than its energy value a question was whether pge should scoop out the sediment behind the dam or simply blow it up and let it go they blew it up just in case teams took wild fall chinook salmon from spawning areas to a hatchery where the fry were raised to be released into the river to keep the stock going the dam never blocked salmon passage a fish ladder allowed fish to get past the dam and some fish advocates were disappointed to see the dam go because it kept hatchery raised fish from mingling with wild salmon above the dam biologists could sort the fish as they entered the fish ladder allowing the wild fish upstream past the dam but keeping the hatchery fish out making the upper reaches effectively a sanctuary for wild fish but bill bakke executive director of the native fish society said the upside is that it lays more groundwork for a lot more dam removals which have value for our rivers

719173 his goal scoring potential is in him and i hope we get that out of him
719174 for now he is not a link player between midfield and the strikers like robin van persie can be and he is maybe at the moment a fraction short physically to play as a real target man

719400 no documentation is maintained for the reconciliation of bail cash to the detail of bails outstanding additionally we were told that one bail account does not agree to the detail by 1 000 and the difference has existed for several years and attempts by the fiscal department to identify the source of the discrepancy was not successful

719416 your commie has no regard for human life not even his own and for this reason men i want to impress upon you the need for extreme watchfulness
719417 surely human affairs would be far happier if the power in men to be silent were the same as that to speak but experience more than sufficiently teaches that men govern nothing with more difficulty than their tongues
719418 really i think that the poorest he that is in england has a life to live as the greatest he and therefore truly sir i think its clear that every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government and i do think that the poorest man in england is not at all bound in a strict sense to that government that he has not had a voice to put himself under

719428 he came here to convey the message of the french president
719429 it is absurd because at maximum he can convey this message that the threat of the west is serious which already is known to iran
719430 iran has accepted the idea of freeze for freeze but it does not make it public because of national pride
719431 iran does not want to fall in the trap laid by the europeans if it says publicly it accepts freeze for freeze the europeans would take it one step ahead

719452 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
719453 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
719454 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
719455 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
719456 the people who believe in the anti christ tend to believe that he she is too powerful for one person to take out with a 30 06
719457 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
719458 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
719459 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
719460 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
719461 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
719462 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

719468 one of the interesting themes explored in picture of dorian gray has to do with the relationship between our imaginative world and the real world it is as if people in society put themselves into their artistic creations or enjoyments and deprive their real lives of that energy basil puts his soul into his painting of dorian and as a result according to lord henry leads a boring life sybil vane invests herself in her acting but can no longer do so once she experiences love in her real life dorian transfers his soul to his portrait so that he can live his life as wastefully as he wants even lord henry uses dorian as an experimental way to live out his philosophy of life vicariously he simply gets dorian to live out his philosophy of hedonism for him in a strange way victorian society told people that they could not live their own lives as they wanted to and then provided ways to live out those lives vicariously by supplying art music novels and other artificial experiences as a substitute in this week try to formulate in your own mind if you can what the relationship between art literature drama computer games sports or film and your own real life is do you live out your own life or is it easier to let artists authors directors athletes poets game developers and people with gifts in imagination provide you with life experiences vicariously what do you see happening in your culture in this regard what are young people being influenced to do again make some reference to the novel in your response
719469 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
719470 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
719471 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
719472 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
719473 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
719474 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
719475 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
719476 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
719477 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
719478 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
719479 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
719480 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
719481 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
719482 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
719483 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
719484 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
719485 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
719486 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
719487 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
719488 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
719489 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
719490 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
719491 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
719492 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
719493 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
719494 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
719495 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
719496 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
719497 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
719498 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
719499 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
719500 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
719501 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
719502 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

719508 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
719509 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
719510 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
719511 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
719512 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
719513 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
719514 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
719515 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
719516 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
719517 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
719518 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
719519 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
719520 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
719521 but some of them will stay in the hospital for observation
719522 ive never seen anything like it spectators fell off their seats

719525 thankfully the crew of chapparal had proper safety equipment aboard their boat and was able to extinguish the fire
719526 the coast guard urges all mariners to ensure they have all the necessary safety equipment aboard their boat and that its in proper working order
719527 we encouraged the family and crew to develop a more structured communication plan for the rest of the trip
719528 we also recommended the crew file a float plan with their family letting them know when and where they plan to stop
719529 pressure buildup in a small sealed sample bottle in a storage safe resulted in plutonium contamination of a storage room
719530 this could have happened in even the most up to date lab
719531 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
719532 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
719533 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
719534 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states
719535 w e all ought to relax a little bit its its a bit of humor

719551 common cause ohio plans to file complaints with the ohio elections commission against officials whove used campaign funds for items such as country club memberships out of state travel and tickets to sporting events
719552 but elected officials work often involves meeting with people at the places where they gather including country clubs out of state conventions and sporting events using campaign funds to attend such functions for political purposes is legitimate

719616 if its what it takes to get her back engaged in school then thats great its really really good
719617 and then theres a knock on the door by the police who serve a letter
719618 theres an informal conference held at the school where some of the agencies get together along with the school and discuss what the issues are
719619 we dont want to prosecute parents for not having their kids at school but we also want them to buy in to the process to get their kids ultimately re engaged back in to school
719620 shes not a bad kid its just she hadnt been turning up to school
719621 sometimes the tough love approach is the best way because it is a shock to students when mum or dad is going to get prosecuted because theyre not going to school
719622 they havent just dumped her i knew he was doing that and its great
719623 but he can tie her up in a kinky s amp m pose

719625 when i first moved to new york and i was totally broke sometimes i would buy vogue instead of dinner i just felt it fed me more
719626 i did it this way and it worked for my system it might work for you based on what you are telling me but i cant really say
719627 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
719628 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
719629 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
719630 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
719631 if sen mccain feels that i can help his candidacy which i think its so important to elect him our next president i will do it
719632 and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as as partisan mudslingers here in washington
719633 they are engaged in character assassination even john mccains partner in a number of initiatives in the senate russ feingold said yesterday theyve decided they cant win on the issues so now theyre going to try to destroy his character and that is exactly what this ad is calculated to do
719634 this reinforces what we have long known that the gun lobby will go to any lengths no matter how unethical to protect the profits of the gun industry in this country
719635 our goal from the very start is to get people using these resources so they appreciate them and are interested in conserving them

719637 these individuals have been following an important legal principle that national cases such as this incinerator case can be adjourned pending a decision at the european court of justice
719638 the supreme court has decided that the cases can be heard in parallel and those who have taken this action have accepted this verdict
719639 to further seek a pound of flesh by asking for costs from ordinary citizens known to be without assets and whose actions are motivated only by having the law in this area clarified amounts to legal bullying
719640 the green party in government cannot be associated with the use of the legal system as a form of intimidation against those whose only motivation is the maintenance of the highest possible standards of environmental protection
719641 im presuming that this is a decision that has been made by the states legal officer in the form of the attorney general however as this is an environmental action it is also being taken against the minister and the department of the environment and i will be calling on the minister to seek not to have these costs pursued

719665 i already stocked over 200 blue shirts because i thought the king might pick the colour in accordance with the day today i sold more than 20 blue shirts after the king left the hospital but i think its pink shirts that are in high demand
719666 i feel very excited and am touched the way thai people love the king it was great to share the happy moment with thais when they saw the king wave his hand i can see that thai people are very close to their king
719667 i am so happy to see him he looks very healthy
719668 i received at least 30 orders in the morning by late afternoon i picked up two sample green shirts from bo bae market and wore one as a sales promotion i sold the other one immediately for 250 baht
719669 the yellow pink and green trends are all because of peoples loyalty to the king
719670 if he wears orange i will also have to put orange shirts on my stall thats a way to express our love of the king
719671 some manufacturers seemed to be caught off guard by the green trend as the pink ones are not yet sold out i dont think they should be concerned as the demand for both pink and green shirts is on the increase
719672 but bloggers were picking up on how many listings we were having on ebay
719673 im sure they were aware of the uproar this would cause
719674 the seller community is upset because ebay is giving a great deal to someone offsite who is overwhelming each of the categories with their listings
719675 the sellers are forced to increase their listings in more expensive parts of the site just to stay even with their sales
719676 things sure dont look good at all for the independent media seller
719677 i have to admit this piece of news feels more scary to me it really is the end of an ebay era in a big way
719678 i was once an economics student so i understand economies of scale principles but i just hate to see ebay turning into just another boring shopping portal full of boring corporate merchants ebay was the peoples marketplace the diversity of sellers and merchandise are going to shrink away now little by little
719679 we did it because ebay gets the most amount of e commerce traffic out there and unfortunately we dont
719680 ebay customers may have heard of us but not bought from us weve looked at ebay as our best partnership to date
719681 i think it will have an effect on revenues since ebay gets more than 10 times our traffic now
719682 i do think that it will dramatically increase our sales over time
719683 the bigger sellers wanted the same opportunity as buy com the more volume you put up the cheaper the listing fee
719684 ebay has always said no to negotiations they went outside instead of looking at the sellers that were doing really well they didnt even bother to ask them
719685 ebay says if you can measure up we can negotiate with you on fees and some other things
719686 but you have to do a minimum of 500 000 a month in sales
719687 buyers on ebay want the hard to find why they go to ebay
719688 but ebay wants to get all the new products thinking that their buyers will have a better experience that way
719689 no one is committing all of their eggs to any single site
719690 truthfully there are some sellers who are going to care they are most likely paying a higher listing fee than buy com is
719691 es un torturador y asesino que form parte de un comprobado plan criminal
719692 es obvio que von wernich no s lo ten a pleno conocimiento del exterminio en curso sino que adem s particip activa y entusiastamente de l como verdadero
719693 surge irrevatible que no estamos como se anticipara ante una mera sucesi n de delitos sino ante algo significativamente mayor que corresponde denominar
719694 la pertenencia activa de von wernich al aparato represivo lo vincula de manera irrefutable a la responsabilidad por las privaciones ilegales de la libertad sufridas por las v ctimas de autos en algunos casos por haberse contactado directamente con ellas y en otros por la sola circunstancia de su presencia comprobada en forma contempor nea con los detenidos y la circulaci n libre del imputado por dichos centros

719698 tampoco cabe soslayar la circunstancia de que nuestra legislaci n carece de una regulaci n procesal espec fica que determine el modo en que deber a llevarse a cabo el enjuiciamiento criminal de las personas de existencia ideal y que permita tambi n individualizar a los sujetos susceptibles de asumir una concreta representaci n en tal sentido en consecuencia la pr ctica judicial materializada al respecto no halla fundamento en texto positivo alguno afectando de esta forma las garant as de legalidad de defensa en juicio y del debido proceso
719699 que ello no implica negar la posibilidad de que las personas de existencia ideal sean sometidas a sanciones jur dicas que comporten el ejercicio de poder coactivo reparador o administrativo pues esta posici n s lo se limita a frenar el impulso por dotar a aquellos entes de capacidad delictiva

719727 voglio scrivere qualcosa in cui i miei contemporanei si riconoscano davvero
719728 its come to our attention that interoperability remains a critical problem in the public safety sector
719729 the state of the art in that market today is single band radios and thats driving a lot of the interoperability problems multiband can be a key enabler in that field this is a radio thats about the same size as a conventional high end single band radio today and its essentially the same cost this really would take the place of three or four radios that you dont have to carry and dont have to buy so i think its operationally and fiscally a pretty attractive value proposition
719730 the unity xg 100 is an advanced multiband radio that will provide public safety personnel with direct communications interoperability whenever and wherever necessary
719731 as a result federal state and local first responders will be able to unify their efforts and provide a better more coordinated response to emergencies
719732 it is very cost competitive and it is very mature
719733 it has been proven in very difficult conditions military conditions around the world
719734 there will be other players that will try to address this interoperability challenge
719735 our view is that harris has the broadest technology in this we have succeeded in our market through an intense focus in serving the end users the most reliable customer service and products
719736 i think they are going to begin the transformation of the public safety communications market
719737 the evolution of business the evolution of public policy has brought us here
719738 for small health care providers with limited resources these upfront costs are enough to break the bank

719741 all six of them got off the bus on the orange line and a fight ensued and one of the gang members pulled a gun and shot once
719742 actually the suspects ended up getting hurt more than the others
719743 theres always the question what were the victims doing that may have prompted the assault could it have been something that was just mutual combat
719744 but the one who took out the gun and shot there is no justification unless it was life or death

719777 we hope the industry will work in partnership with the government in making sure the recommendations are listened to but it is important to remember that it is all of our responsibility to ensure they remain safe

719786 if hed bought them on ebay hed have paid more for them theres a fairly fanatical cult that has grown up around them
719787 what we were attempting to work around in the original sda technology was interaural crosstalk iac which restricts the sound we hear from two speakers to the area between the speakers
719788 what people responded to in the original sda loudspeakers was our reduction of iac but sda surround clusters four pairs of loudspeakers along the soundbar each of them separated from its mate by a distance calculated to eliminate head related transfer function hrtf and appear to produce sound in back of the listener as well as solidly in front of him in other words the processor is crunching the signal to cancel crosstalk stabilize the binaural image and cancel iac while creating a front to back soundstage
719789 oh sure it sounds so easy when you put it like that
719790 were not using one theres a sub output on the soundbar box and it will automatically switch in a low pass filter when it detects a connection now lets listen to some music because you know i wouldnt be happy with this if it didnt work just as well on two channel audio as it does on movies
719791 one cable connects the soundbar to the processor player and one cable connects to the television and thats it
719792 but the fact is that most people will also need to connect a set top cable box at the very least thats what the s video and digital inputs are there for also analog inputs a tape loop and a video loop as well as am and fm antenna inputs for the radio
719793 i built the soundbar 360 because i really wanted something this simple myself
719794 surely matthew polk can have any hi fi or a v system he wants
719795 sure i can but my wife and i built a new house and we wanted entertainment options in the guest bedrooms preferably ones with good enough performance that i could be proud of them and easy enough to use that our guests could operate them

719798 of course this prada dress was on the sales rack at marshalls
719799 that sounds like a high figure to me but its no secret that we need workers from the expanded eu area
719800 on the contrary its access to cheap labour which allows norwegian farms to scrape by in the face of high costs in order to compete with cheap imports its obviously an advantage to employ labour that doesnt demand top wages
719801 they dont want farm work and i dont think they would be able to manage it either
719802 we started using the hijab three years ago and it was very difficult to find any that fit into daily life in a western country
719803 we kept getting questions from other girls and women about where we had bought them
719804 it should be comfortable to use a hijab even if youre working as a nurse or cleaning woman
719805 there are many people who dont know enough about the hijab and therefore have certain prejudices

719813 the real reason behind the meeting is still to be revealed by priyanka
719814 the meeting is unique there is no comparison in the world history priyanka and nalini did not know each other prior to the meeting it is unexpected for a daughter of a victim in a gruesome murder to meet an accused who had been sentenced with death penalty later on converted to sentence for life
719815 whatever may me the reason for not coming out with real reason for meeting the courage and the generosity of priyanka should be appreciated the outcome of the meeting in no way helps nalini

719820 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
719821 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
719822 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
719823 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
719824 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
719825 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
719826 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
719827 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
719828 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
719829 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war
719830 women of destiny releasing you to fulfill gods call in your life and in the church

719834 let the dead bury their own dead but you go and proclaim the the second example we have in this passage of scripture is that of a man who receives the call of god upon his life to work for the lord this time it is not the man who asks to follow jesus it is jesus who asks the man to follow him
719835 if anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother his wife and children his brothers and sisters yes even his own life he cannot be my disciple
719836 i will follow you lord but first let me go back and say good by to my family
719837 partial obedience is the same thing as absolute disobedience and god wont use a disobedient disciple
719838 if you try to sit on two chairs you will fall between them for life you must choose one chair
719839 and when one of them meets with his other half
719840 im asking the lord to help me preach a good sermon
719841 are you not in error because you do not know the scriptures or the power of god
719842 our god is so great that he upholds the heavens and the earth
719843 the lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance
719844 he looked around at them in anger and deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts
719845 but if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the lord your god and cannot carry your tithe because the place where the lord will choose to put his name is so far away then exchange your tithe for silver and take the silver with you and go to the place the lord your god will choose
719846 is it not written my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations
719847 gods work must always have the aroma of prayer the greatest thing you can learn is to learn how to pray
719848 dont you know that you yourselves are gods temple and that gods spirit lives in you
719849 why do you submit yourselves to decrees such as do not handle do not taste do not touch
719850 food will not commend us to god we are neither the worse if we do not eat nor the better if we do eat
719851 some have exalted religious fasting beyond all scripture and reason however others have utterly disregarded it
719852 more than any other discipline fasting reveals the things that control us
719853 humbly and quietly with scarcely a movement she brings up out of the dark places of my soul the dissatisfactions in relationships the frustrations of the ministry the fears of failure the emptiness of wasted time and just when my heart begins to retreat to the delicious hope of eating supper at pizza hut she quietly reminds me not tonight
719854 for everything god created is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving
719855 food is good your many gifts are good but you are better
719856 god is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him
719857 but when you fast put oil on your head and wash your face so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting but only to your father who is unseen and your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you
719858 god is committed to rewarding those acts of the human heart that signify human helplessness and hope in god
719859 i will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of water of life without cost
719860 father i am empty but you are full i am hungry but you are the bread of life i am thirsty but you are the fountain of life i am broken but you are whole
719861 whenever you fast do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do for they neglect their appearance in order to be seen fasting by men
719862 there is nothing in me with which i can muster up passion for you o lord but i love you so much and want to have a deeper longing and hunger after you
719863 not my will but yours father i dont want you to confirm my ideas anymore but rather teach me your ways o lord
719864 i turned to the lord god and pleaded with him in prayer petition and fasting
719865 i didnt invent pin up and im not the pin up police

719873 ideas cannot be fought except by means of better ideas the battle consists not of opposing but of exposing not of denouncing but of disproving not of evading but of boldly proclaiming a full consistent and radical alternative
719874 we gave in without a struggle we gave up your divine mandate for we did not know anything about it our podiums fell silent our churches rang with calls for mammon and un missions in a fog of forgetfulness our patriots and ministers inadvertently joined the march toward the new world order and we lost the sight and dream of the new order of the ages divinely inspired and mandated by you oh lord through ignorance and sloth we failed you god

719929 my god what a book i love the way that the characters fit together like a jigsaw puzzle and their stories fall into place piece by piece i love the way that violence and politics and terror are woven into the plot without sacrificing any of the other threads and the way that bombay becomes the central character i cant wait to sell it
719930 want to get lost in a big sprawling hardcore mystery
719931 this intense epic from india will inevitably be compared to the godfather but i think the comparisons can only be made on the surface level yes this is a story about a criminal overlord in mumbai and the policeman who brings him down but aside from these two great characters chandra has included a vast array of fascinating characters including gangsters prostitutes movie stars and everyday families as well as a gripping storyline told in alternating chapters from the two main characters perspectives were thrown into the streets of india with vivid descriptions that call to mind charles dickens dont let the length intimidate you either youll be pulled in so quickly that by the time you reach the 900th page youll wish there more
719932 it has been a long time since a novel has gripped me from the first sentence it is victorian in scope and also surreal in description chandras prose leaves me with a quiet presence it is great storytelling transcended by both universal and very contemporary concerns
719933 this majestic sprawling novel india verifies the brilliance of vikram chandra
719934 with a gorgeous prose style completely engaging characters and a twisting suspenseful plot this is a novel that seems short at 900 pages after the lives of a sikh policeman and a mumbai gangster intersect in an unexpected way we hear the gangsters story in his own words while following the policemans life forward through surprising events an absolutely wonderful book
719935 a lush sprawling novel of lives both large and small beautifully written and constructed this exceptional novel is both fast moving and profound it is an impressive work of surprising and sublime resonance which will remains with the reader long after the last page is turned
719936 the story is told with such richness and complexity of character that i didnt want it to ever end
719937 historical detail sometimes overwhelms a novel and leaves you bored not so with sacred games the story was riveting and the history of the culture informative the characters were so well drawn i had trouble letting them go
719938 a sprawling exuberant old fashioned story detailing the intertwined lives of the gangsters of modern mumbai chandra peppers his narrative with hindi words that give one a sense of closeness with the characters detailing the dectectives and criminals schemers and observers of this world he has created an engaging novel that searches for moral warmth in a time of betrayal and greed
719939 fabulous wwhat a great reading experience intimate and over the top at the same time this is going to be a lot of fun to sell and perfect for those long nights in january
719940 sacred games is a brilliant crime epic which impressively balances a literary detective and gangster story with a cinematically violent tale of contemporary bombay one of chandras most remarkable achievements amidst this novel of marvels is his ability to turn mundane moments into extraordinary ones as a fathers lovingly ritualized inquiries of his sons hygiene is just as compelling as far higher octane scenes of crime and gang wars the overall effect for the reader is to have the breadth and depth of bombays peoples exposed and made immediate highlighting the manner in which the citys impressive violence touches all in chandras perfect circle
719941 incredibly engaging and rich it will appeal to men women and readers of literary fiction as well as of good crime novelists
719942 chandra grants his reader a voyeuristic peak into the thoughts of a policeman and the gangster he pursues while he reveals the histories and motivations of the members of his supporting cast set in the richly complex world of modern day india this is a masterfully crafted tale of intrigue where no one is purely innocent and no one is without virtue
719943 one of the best novels ive read in a long time
719944 i loved loved and loved it what a fabulous opening it has the good the bad and the ugly are all through the book but chandra writes about them with such affection and regard that its impossible not to care about them in that way it was so much like suitable boy thank you for bringing it to me
719945 sacred games far surpassed my expectations the mafia angle always sells well but chandras prose elevates it to a literary masterpiece chandra has captured that gritty sickeningly sweet perspiration soaked electrifying addictive quality of india chandra has managed to weave the best and worst parts of mumbai into an utterly spellbinding novel it will appeal to those who have been and loved it those that hate it will question their motives for doing so and those that have never been will buy it for the opportunity to do so without the expense and lengthy flight if this book doesnt skyrocket to the top of every bestseller list i need to find a new line of work because that will prove i know nothing about books
719946 what its for is for women who need to talk
719947 somewhere near 25 percent of women do not even have a best friend so if youre going through something lets just say youre going through a divorce you dont want to share it with a mom or a sister
719948 you want to share it with someone who will listen who will be encouraging who can maybe help you through some steps to get rid of the anger we are listening and encouraging the person who needs someone to listen to
719949 i was exposed to the ministry and went through the training there and greatly benefited just from that
719950 its about outreach and having a heart for hurting women as all the women in the ministry do
719951 weve been praying about opening this center for all those years to see if its what god wanted us to do
719952 we think that women shouldnt have to go to outside sources to fulfill those needs and there should be support for this population in our community
719953 not everyone has the means to get to jefferson city or columbia and speak with somebody about things that are stressful in their lives
719954 offers crisis intervention with a spiritual emphasis reaching hurting women through ministry
719955 you would be surprised with the number of people that really dont have anyone that they can go to in confidence and not worry about anyone else telling what theyve told them
719956 because of that breakdown the high level of stress factors in our society and just the spiritual need of people in the world today is why the center is so needed
719957 i think it would be very beneficial for the pastors and priests in the area
719958 i assume that they are probably overwhelmed with people coming to them
719959 so women talking to women i would think might be a lot of help to them if they have a situation where a man doesnt know or have that experience with a certain thing like divorce it would be a great place to send some of their church members
719960 one of the great novels of our time epic in its scope and ambition it has everything one could wish for in a novel
719961 a mesmerizing literary thriller about our world today reading this masterwork has been an unprecedented pleasure
719962 enormously satisfying and exciting crammed with mesmerizing characters and a gorgeous sense of place
719963 a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step
719964 dont speak to me of talent speak to me of desire

719966 we advise this because we have to avoid creating a bad image at companies we send staff to
719967 peoples first impressions are based on what a person wears
719968 wearing clothes that expose skin or casual attire creates a image of a selfish person whos brash or showy a person misses out before they know it and should realize that clothing makes a difference to their salary

719970 like the time we ate a bunch of asparagus to see how long it takes before your pee smells funny ding it was very scientific for me it was 11 minutes for her it was 17
719971 what information will my audience require in order to understand what im saying
719972 chandra conjures up an india of glittering bombay sophisticates gritty policemen high finance and low crime a sureness of touch and mastery of structure that are deeply satisfying a considerable achievement one in which the author marries his storytelling prowess to a profound understanding of indias ageless and ever changing society
719973 immensely absorbing impeccably controlled intelligent sensuous and sometimes grim chandras timeless and timely book is remarkably life affirming considering the dark areas of the heart he explores
719974 a brilliant work equally effective in its radiant separate parts and as a pleasingly complex and highly original construction
719975 taut and dramatically paced evocative and lushly written compelling finely crafted
719976 wonderfully complex and entertaining mr chandras touch is light and his nuanced prose style is a delight to read this collection reminds one of the fundamental pleasures of fiction the enjoyment of surrendering to the engaging imagination of a superior writer
719977 chandra has built a powerful moving saga that explores colonialism death and suffering ephemeral pleasure and the search for the meaning of life this is an astonishing and brilliant debut
719978 wonderfully told with vividly atmospheric descriptions appealing minor characters and interesting insights into the history and culture of colonial
