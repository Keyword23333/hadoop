7420036 she did find solace she took long walks out on the yorkshire moors if she walked long enough her roiling mind would settle the expanse of heather was scented balm that soothed the throbbing anger fear and pain she described how on one occasion her anxiety began to drop like layers of scarves suddenly she was aware of being immersed in a sacred presence that upheld her and everything
7420037 while this experience out on the moors happened only once it proved a real turning point in her life and drew her into the way of prayer she knew from her own experience that there was something in her that was deeper than her pain and anxiety and that when the chaos of the mind was quieted the sense of anguish gave way to a sense of divine presence
7420038 it was like a church to me i entered it on soft foot breath held like a cap in the hand it was quiet what god was there made himself felt not listened to in clean colours that brought a moistening of the eye in movement of the wind over grass
7420039 there were no prayers said but stillness of the hearts passions that was praise enough and the minds cession of its kingdom i walked on simple and poor while the air crumbled and broke on me generously as bread

7420041 originally announced for mobile phones final fantasy agito xiiis storyline has remained somewhat fuzzy up until now

7420044 it is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream when you have something like a nightmare you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream it is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this
7420045 i cant do this anymore youre just not the man i fell in wuv with wast year get wost woser

7420052 this is going to be a special night when ken odom wa4fcw sc founded the freewheelers in 1998 his vision was to have a net that welcome everyone i cant think of a better way to honor ken and celebrate our anniversary than to do this extended net
7420053 in 10 years weve had a chance to touch a lot of people were hoping to get some of our original net control operators back for the event
7420054 the lifting of the code requirement was a pretty big deal for ham radio and our net the foot traffic on the hf hands has increased and its helped us a lot but i think the biggest reason for our growth is the fact that the freewheelers welcomes everyone and the fact that were so friendly
7420055 at the freewheelers we have a couple of simple rules first no inappropriate language we also encourage the members to stay away from controversial issues that tend to divide people like politics and religion bottom line is that we want to have fun with our ham radio hobby
7420056 it was more a matter of realizing i was worth saving from the train collision
7420057 so we are urging people to take care and do whatever they can to make sure that their overseas money is safely invested
7420058 now the criminal has the victims name address and his bank account details to work with from there he can build up the guys whole identity
7420059 what they would also do is sometimes send out a questionnaire directly to the victim they claim its research for the bank or they just want the person to confirm their details and in that way they get a signature
7420060 in one instance we found that a foreign credit card was intercepted in the post they took it and then had an international driving licence made out in that persons name which is deadly because its proof of identity thats all they needed to go and buy a whole bunch of laptops
7420061 the problem now comes when you have to investigate this everything is paper driven and you have to work through diplomatic channels
7420062 there is unfortunately no easy step by step way to stop the fraud completely but by being aware and putting measures in place people are less likely to fall victim
7420063 learning more and more about less and less and less
7420064 i am also a member of the cincinnati 2600 group we get together once a month and listen to folks present on nifty things like sql injections and packet sniffing in early august we did lightning talks which are little 5 minute presentations instead of the usualy 30 60 minute format i

7420070 the door was locked i knocked for a long time but they refused to open i said i wanted seiso returned i knocked so hard that the neighbours came out

7420072 the phone tracked our walk down the block with accuracy bordering on creepiness
7420073 people need stories more than bread itself they tell us how to live and why
7420074 still despite all this traveling is the great true love of my life i have always felt ever since i was sixteen years old and first went to russia with my saved up babysitting money that to travel is worth any cost or sacrifice i am loyal and constant in my love for travel as i have not always been loyal and constant in my other loves i feel about travel the way a happy new mother feels about her impossible colicky restless newborn baby i just dont care what it puts me through because i adore it because its mine because it looks exactly like me it can barf all over me if it wants to i just dont care
7420075 what i like best about you is that when you see water you have to be in it

7420145 since he was there i asked chad if he could stop by tonight
7420146 i know but you were trying to do something nice for me and

7420148 im sorry it is just so immense talk to me what do you want to do today
7420149 we are what do you want to do see the whole thing in one trip or focus on a few rooms and then come back another time
7420150 well if its on the row then its not like it wont be right here
7420151 this is the city willow you dont run in the streets or people think you stole a purse

7420153 bravo do they sell off the rack you need that dress
7420154 ive just ordered one similar and i have no intention of buying two almost the same
7420155 what do you think of the fit its comfortable but it feels a little roomy
7420156 buy it if you dont i am and ill pick the colors i know you like the least
7420157 that dress was incredible ive never seen such a transformation
7420158 i just went clothes shopping with a woman no less and left the store in less than an hour and without any bags
7420159 and with a lighter bank balance i had the money to pay for them bill
7420160 ah but stores like that arent accustomed to dealing with cash ill cut myself a check on monday so
7420161 what do you want to do now shall we do some window shopping or would you like to visit rocklands first library its up here just a few more blocks or if we turn around and go back the way we came my apartment building is just a few blocks over somehow i always pictured you with a house yellow with a green door and a white picket fence oh and a cat one of those sleek black ones
7420162 yeah its one of the nicest buildings in town i love it
7420163 franco this is my friend willow from fairbury i thought id give her the grand tour
7420164 well youll see me at my worst if lin hasnt been there yet
7420165 thats kind of you willow but she gets paid whether or not you do so why dont you enjoy your day off
7420166 that might be because youve been in tokyo for the past month how was the trip
7420167 oh im sorry margot this is willow willow meet my neighbor margot wyngate she lives across the hall
7420168 im having a few people over tonight i left an invitation under your door

7420170 sorry we have plans for sushi tonight and of course she lives in fairbury so well be heading that way awfully late
7420171 hmm i hadnt thought about it but you might be right
7420172 well yes margots beautiful and shes actually a very nice woman but im not interested and i have to make sure i dont give her the impression that i am
7420173 i think i could learn to like it but its still a little intimidating to me its impressive though thats for sure
7420174 well that tells me what it is but it still doesnt tell me what it is
7420175 come on youll get all hot and sweaty and then youll be miserable all day
7420176 lets go down by the rmc and find a pasty vendor
7420177 you know how chicago is known for its pizza and new york for their hot dog street vendors well here we have pasty vendors were world famous for them we cant have a day in rockland without pasties
7420178 its ridiculous of course theyll spend millions in taxpayer dollars for a lake and for what well look like a poor mans chicago
7420179 id sell it developers could buy it farmers philanthropists anyone i just dont think its an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars
7420180 what if a philanthropist bought it and paid for the lake
7420181 youre right my pride still doesnt like it but at least itd be private money spent rather than my hard earned and your hard earned money
7420182 willow you have money that makes money for you while you sleep
7420183 seems like a lazy way to earn money but it lets me live well so i wont complain
7420184 not everyones parents leave them a home and the skills to keep themselves fed
7420185 we discussed your financial situation the day we arranged the funeral do you remember
7420186 yes you said the bills were paid and that id still have the money to keep up with taxes and the things we have to buy i know ive been a little extravagant since mother died but i mostly used the money in the house so i thought itd be ok
7420187 how much money do you think the average american earns and spends per year on living expenses
7420188 oh it must be thousands i know our cow alone is several hundred dollars every year
7420189 so give me a ballpark figure what do most americans spend to live every year
7420190 i dont know maybe five or ten thousand people have cars and things that cost money so maybe a little more mother and i never discussed it i wonder why that never came up
7420191 multiply that by ten you and your mother live on around ten thousand most years a little more lately but the price of everything is going up of course
7420192 i had no idea we spent so much money how long will the money last
7420193 how much money do you think i have to have to live in my apartment travel like i do and have the lifestyle i have
7420194 probably about the same as me i mean you have more expensive things but i have land and animals and you have furniture and a vehicle
7420195 my retirement account is about an eighth of your bank account by the time i retire i hope to have about two to five million dollars saved if my investments do well youll have well over double or even triple that just keeping it in the safe slow growth account you have meanwhile i have to earn six figures a year to live my life and i spend a significant portion of it
7420196 i wonder how much chad makes ill have to ask him that is fascinating

7420285 68 hours in 57 days youve spent nearly three days in the cockpit
7420286 you might not believe this john but im not on a first name basis with any other student most people only stay with me through basic instrument training
7420287 perhaps its because of that rob that so few people know why i fly in the first place why ill give trainees free hours and delay landings as long as possible
7420288 at the very least i suppose i can share that reason with you
7420289 few people ever did know what aviation meant to me
7420290 youve been with me enough to become a member of that small crowd it always has relieved me to share the story
7420291 planes are simple things to control rob you move your hands one way and the plane banks left tap the pedal with your right foot and youre ready to deal with a crosswind when youre in the mood to climb you need only pull back landing is a simple matter of lining up the undercarriage with the centerline
7420292 no you wouldnt because your career and love life so far have been one perfect approach after another thats why i need to tell you my experience it is the only way for you to understand
7420293 did i ever tell you about my days at the air force academy
7420294 you got your bearings in a cessna and practiced with a few carrier jets
7420295 my sophomore year the inspector found five bottles of alcohol in my room and a bong filled to the brim i was on a flight back to philadelphia the next day bags notebooks and all
7420296 tune 116 3 and make a twenty degree turn to line up with casanova
7420297 to think that at one point i found those carrier jets so hard to maneuver i had a yoke i had pedals i had enough dials and switches to fill well a fighter cockpit if only life itself came with the same controls perhaps i would have been able to avert that tailspin
7420298 i left that school with more determination than i had entering it just five years after the discharge i was on the flight deck of an md 11 with an atp license in hand a beautiful machine so simple to control and that was why i loved to enter it
7420299 it was a new airline that didnt take in much and i was a new pilot who didnt ask for much a winning combination in the industry they used me for regional flights but i deadheaded just about everywhere leipzig lima london la paz lisbon and thats just the ls
7420300 you wonder why i didnt stay with the airline well there was a flight attendant in the jump seat next to me danita montez we agreed to meet for dinner after touching down and things took off after that within a year we terminated our jobs with the airline and walked down the aisle
7420301 with her by my side i felt as if life really were as easy to control as an airliner id pull up and out of bed retract my eyes take on some fuel downstairs and head due east to an instructors academy in the evening id pull back from the couch and descend into the blankets but there was a failure along the way danita said my communications systems broke down she left the cabin after weeks of sparring over this and that
7420302 it seems that planes are the only thing i can control anymore any chance i can get to be in one ill take any chance to drift 10 000 feet above this world and leave my stress at the airport ill take its life that ive become afraid of
7420303 i can only wonder about people like you who live so effortlessly as if theres some autopilot switch for money and love that youre not telling me about

7420358 this is a first ladies and gentlemen my baby has just become a man
7420359 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7420360 probably my understanding of where to be in certain situations at times i rushed my routes a lot instead of being more patient knowing when to break and knowing when to get in and out of a break just my overall understanding on where to be at
7420361 definitely definitely i look at everybody everybody brings a different dimension to their game i try to take a little from each guy
7420362 i had a good feeling that i was definitely going to get drafted but this is a business and you never know
7420363 well obviously they didnt draft any receivers and i knew they were in need of some receivers and they showed the most interest they told me that they actually wanted to draft me but they had other needs they showed a lot of commitment to me and i believe in that a lot
7420364 yeah they called me in the late fifth early sixth round but they also told me that werent going to be able to draft me they wanted to but they couldnt
7420365 i think so overall as a team there definitely was but in the trenches is what really made that game our offensive line obviously wasnt ready for that type of speed we hadnt seen that all year so it really wasnt their fault
7420366 oh man unbelievable we worked hard a lot our coaches and strength coaches did a good job of keeping us in shape
7420367 not necessarily because when i was at hawaii we had plays where there were set routes and you had to run routes

7420380 id say the same thing if bill were sitting across this desk from me
7420381 if there was a game today he said saturday afternoon
7420382 i feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today in the world is abortion because it is a war against the child a direct killing of the innocent child murder by the mother herself and if we can accept that a mother can kill even her own child how can we tell other people not to kill one another how do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion as always we must persuade her with love and we must remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts jesus gave even his life to us so the mother who is thinking of abortion should be helped to love that is to give until it hurts her plans or her free time to respect the life of her child the father of that child whoever he is must also give until it hurts by abortion the mother does not learn to love but kills even her own child to solve her problems and by abortion the father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world that father is likely to put other women into the same trouble so abortion just leads to more abortion any country that accepts abortion is not teaching the people to love but to use any violence to get what they want that is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion

7420736 ok now that weve covered a few basics there are three basic methods to applying thermal compound the first is a small ball or dab of thermal compound placed on the middle of the processors ihs then secure the hsf to the motherboard the hsf will spread the thermal compound between the ihs and hsf creating a bond the next method is used by several of the thermal compounds well be testing today these thermal compounds will usually include an applicator so you can spread the thermal compound over the entire surface of the processors ihs typically youll spread the thermal compound in an even extremely thin coat then secure the hsf to the board the third method is recommended by arctic silver long the standard for enthusiasts for their outstanding products using this method youll apply a thin line of thermal compound down the middle of the ihs whichever method you use id recommend seating the hsf on the board then removing it to make sure you are getting a full and even coverage of the processor often many people apply too much compound which can cause some serious issues not just with temperatures but those using an electrically conductive thermal compound can actually kill their system if it comes into contact with electrical traces or capacitors on the opposite end of the spectrum using too little or uneven application can cause issues such as poor heat transfer and high temperatures so before you put your system together and fire it up check your work and make sure the thermal compound is applied correctly
7420737 it is impossible to fall out of love love is such a powerful emotion that once it envelops you it does not depart true love is eternal if you think that you were once in love but fell out of it then it wasnt love you were in there are no exit signs in love there is only an on ramp

7420747 change is a funny thing too often we think things like change is hard i hate change decisions are tough we dont look forward to change we joke that we would prefer things not to change so i wondered why is it we never think of or remember all the great changes we loved meeting someone and falling in love getting married having a baby starting a new job we didnt think we would get making some well earned money losing weight moving to a great new place recovering from an illness doing something exceptional deciding to change careers go back to school pursuing a dream simply becoming a happier person or meeting that person that became your best friend now there are hundreds of great life changes and decisions we have all been part of what are some of the best decisions you have made what are some of the hardest changes you actually got through and developed real inner strength and spirit i met an older man in a restaurant the other day in new york he overheard me passionately encouraging a friend of mine who was exploring making a change in his life moving changing careers etc he interrupted us and reminded me that change was against human nature people only want safety and security he together with so many of us want to keep our little world exactly the same he had never thought of all the great changes he had experienced so far in his life and yet everyday we are reminded that everything changes everything if we could only start welcoming changes even those that make us feel out of control where we dont know how things might end up where our world may be turned around we might see that usually there is the seed of something new something positive that is already growing beneath the surface change is not meant to make us bitter only better someone famous said this to me at some point think of what would never happen if nothing ever changed from this point on in your life now would you prefer to allow change in or would you prefer to sign up for the no more change ever program

7420762 we are looking for proposals that bring an innovative and creative perspective to australias recent migration history that have an intelligent voice provide insight into our society and reveal something new
7420763 the landmark series reflects screen australias commitment to enable support the production of programs which are of national interest illuminating significant topics in our national story with opportunities to extend the series to a cross platform environment these programs will significantly also expand their impact beyond their initial television screening

7420778 the most important things i would look for in any computer are its processor and how much ram random access memory it has
7420779 without a decent processor or with little to no ram the performance of everything in the computer becomes hindered no matter how much money you put into it
7420780 processor speed is the most important because it is so much more expensive to upgrade compared to everything else
7420781 if i wanted to upgrade my processor after i had made some extra money i would have to seriously consider getting an entirely new computer because it wouldnt be that much more expensive

7420834 the fact that satellite radio started in canada later than it did south of the border may have some bearing on this situation
7420835 in 2006 commercial radio generated profits before interest and taxes of 284 0 million a modest increase of 0 4 compared to 2005 and achieved a profit margin of 20 0 the third highest in the last 40 years after those of 2005 21 0 and 1971 20 5

7420973 la actitud del car cter autoritario hacia la vida su filosof a toda se hallan determinadas por sus impulsos emocionales el car cter autoritario prefiere aquellas condiciones que limitan la libertad humana gusta someterse al destino y lo que ste ha de significar para l depende de la situaci n social que le toque en suerte
7420974 prosperidad y crisis no constituyen para l fen menos sociales que puedan ser cambiados por la actividad humana sino la expresi n de un poder superior al que es menester someterse y son experimentadas como una fatalidad inconmovible no solamente aquellas fuerzas que determinan directamente la propia vida sino tambi n las que parecen moldear la vida en general es la fatalidad la que establece un grado perenne de sufrimiento que no podr disminuir jam s
7420975 la caracter stica de todo pensamiento autoritario reside en la convicci n de que la vida est determinada por fuerzas exteriores al yo individual a sus intereses a sus deseos la nica manera de hallar la felicidad ha de buscarse en la sumisi n a tales fuerzas
7420976 el car cter autoritario no carece de actividad valor o fe pero estas cualidades significan para l algo completamente distinto de lo que representan para las personas que no anhelan la sumisi n porque la actividad del car cter autoritario se arraiga en el sentimiento b sico de impotencia sentimiento que trata de anular por medio de la actividad esto no significa otra cosas que la necesidad de obrar en nombre de algo superior al propio yo
7420977 el car cter autoritario extrae la fuerza para obrar apoy ndose en ese poder superior este no puede ser nunca atacado o cambiado para l la debilidad es siempre un signo inconfundible de culpabilidad e inferioridad y si el ser en el cual cree el car cter autoritario da se ales de debilitarse su amor y su respeto se transforman en odio y desprecio en la filosof a autoritaria el concepto de igualdad no existe el car cter autoritario puede a veces emplear el t rmino igualdad en forma puramente convencional o bien porque conviene a sus prop sitos pero no posee para l significado real o importancia puesto que se refiere a algo ajeno a su experiencia emocional para l el mundo se compone de personas que tienen poder y otras que carecen de l de superiores e inferiores sobre la base de sus impulsos experimenta tan solo la dominaci n o la sumisi n jam s la solidaridad
7420978 la funci n de una ideolog a y pr cticas autoritarias puede compararse a la funci n de los s ntomas neur ticos
7420979 el anhelo de libertad no es una fuerza metaf sica los sistemas autoritarios no pueden suprimir las condiciones b sicas que originan el anhelo de libertad ni tampoco pueden destruir la b squeda de libertad que surge de esas mismas condiciones

7420989 i liked that cw provided a much needed solution to consumers minor collision repair problems which ultimately saves time and money
7420990 when consumers find we can take care of that grocery store parking lot dent or scratch at their home or office without giving up their car they are thrilled
7420991 cws mobile approach to minor collision repairs that are typically under the insurance deductible saves consumers time money and maintains the resale value of their vehicles
7420992 will keep their vehicles looking good and preserve the resale value as well

7421012 if you have a look at our record we are the sixth or seventh best try scoring team in the competition
7421013 our defence has been an issue and our goal kicking isnt great two from 10 has certainly kept them in the game
7421014 we had to pick from 18 fit players but all you need is 17 out on the field and they were all outstanding tonight our halves ryan mcgoldrick and luke dorn were excellent
7421015 im a little bit shell shocked we got what we deserved
7421016 cas ran harder than us and tackled harder than us and fully deserved to win by the margin that they did
7421017 were heading into the play offs and if thats the form that were in then it will be very short lived i dont think anybody can be spared across the board we were poor and a very distant second best
7421018 this is our first time here and im really surprised how many people turn out for such a great event and how many dogs are here

7421024 every time i breastfed i would sign milk and say it at the same time very quickly i just had to sign milk to olivia from across the room and she would beam a big smile and squeal knowing what it meant
7421025 at seven months olivia surprised us by signing milk and would sign to anyone who was holding her when she was hungry
7421026 olivias understanding of signed words was incredible and she was very quick to sign back once she learned words we had a lot of fun and she had no temper tantrums whatsoever my friends and family were astonished at this very easy going little girl who simply asked for what she wanted and understood what was allowed or not
7421027 olivia is now two and a half years old and she loves to sign to her little twin brothers who are now 11 months old they both have long ago understood the sign for milk and will sign it back
7421028 youre too important to me to be forgotten like this your birthday shouldnt be forgotten and im very sorry i did
7421029 its theo from school are you up for mrs thrailkills assignment
7421030 do we like have each of us offer five things about herself and everyone carbon copies to their list or do we each have to learn five different things about each other person
7421031 that would mean fifteen facts per person i dont think any of us is that interesting
7421032 i dont think mrs thrailkill really meant for us to do hardcore research
7421033 its probably just something she has students like us do an exercise busywork
7421034 right i say we treat this like a book report first and last paragraph are genuine middle three are filler

7421042 and whoever finds something that looks suitable send everyone else the url okay
7421043 a work in progress thats mediocre or even shitty the developers announce it way ahead of time to drum up buzz they make false promises and use all these vague or confusing terms to make their product sound alluring
7421044 it says one of us has to serve as host to everyone else one of us will be the host and the rest will be the visitors like a server client sort of thing
7421045 it says the host has to have enough room for all his guests so dont invite like thirty people if you dont think theyll fit in your board room office living room bedroom or whatever
7421046 it probably has to do with ram and bandwidth and all that if you have too many people in the same chat room the connection gets sluggish we should be fine though
7421047 lets just try this supermeganet thing who wants to be host

7421049 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7421050 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is a gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7421051 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7421052 we make so much music that sometimes waiting for album to be released for folks to peep is too long we may be on to something completely different by then and those tracks may not get used so its good to leak em out so they get heard and people can have something in between projects
7421053 hey saw your post do you like asian women what part of town are you in are you around

7421080 but i dont want that im not a superstar im not saying this for effect im only here to entertain people i keep telling my wife i dont want to be either no 1 or no 2 i just want to be alive and kicking in the film industry
7421081 it is not a great film its an entertaining film thats the kind of cinema i believe in
7421082 its my first home production and ive dedicated the film to my late secretary mr vikas bali and to my father theyd be so proud of singh is kinng
7421083 thats a scary thought and i dont want to think about it
7421084 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
7421085 i feel this is amitabhs best performance he was the obvious choice for the role
7421086 amitabh suited the role of the ageing theatre actor perfectly i dont think anyone would have fitted the bill so well he is so eccentric performs so brilliantly and the way he speaks english is so impeccable and clear i feel he is the crowning glory of the film
7421087 rituparno ghosh creates magic out of relationship based cinema i dont think anyone would have treated the script the way he has done it
7421088 this film is in english and anyone who understands the language can enjoy it it imparts undertones of various messages and talks in particular of the conflict between theatre and cinema
7421089 i love watching a film like om shanti om but i know there are better people who are making such masala and romantic films now more intelligent and meaningful stories need to be told even mithya was such a film
7421090 the last lear is a niche film and so it was required to be shown internationally before being brought it to india it has already travelled to film festivals in toronto rome and london
7421091 when we thought of releasing the film around the summer vacations this year the ipl indian premier league matches were on and there were also a lot of big films packed till now we wanted to release it at a decent time when there wont be many commercial films to compete with
7421092 singh is kinng has turned out to be a huge success i think it will also help our film as seeing a trailer in a theatre is very different from seeing it on tv the theatrical trailer definitely has more impact and also generates more curiosity in the audience
7421093 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
7421094 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time mr bounds said in a statement reported by fox news
7421095 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7421096 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time mr bounds said in a statement reported by fox news the espionage thriller

7421100 do you really think nuns are all elderly straitlaced and funereal
7421101 its no longer that way these days there are nuns from africa and latin america who are really very very lovely the brazilians particularly
7421102 the ecc took anyone opposed to the south african defence force even troops
7421103 conscription was the only way whites felt the pain of apartheid and this made it an ideal mobilising tool apartheid wasnt worth dying for
7421104 a resolution at a black sash conference in 1983 called for an end to conscription
7421105 that night a few of us chatting in a graveyard realised that this resolution was the way to bypass the defence act which prescribed a 10 year jail sentence for anyone who encouraged people to disobey their call up
7421106 we could call on the state not to conscript as we were not calling on individuals to refuse to serve
7421107 it was not without tensions but it was held together by a clever leadership
7421108 it was a scary time to be a young activist people did much braver things than us but we were breaking very deliberately with our group those days were awful we lived in fear of being detained an experience not shared by the rest of the white population
7421109 i befriended vusi khanyile now chair of the investment company thebe and got a taste of what life was like for black south africans when i received my call up in 1977 vusi was detained i knew i couldnt put on an sadf uniform
7421110 my boss was furious with me so who will stop our daughters being raped on the border he asked
7421111 i was put in solitary confinement and amazingly left with my books i got to read wittgenstein and all the books i always wanted to read but didnt have the time
7421112 i dont know if it did anything directly for me it was an issue of conscience
7421113 i was trying to get people to think to question authority
7421114 there was an expectation that whites would collaborate with the apartheid government but the fact that there were people prepared to make a sacrifice sent a powerful message
7421115 any violence was contrary to the spirit of love peace and healing the path id chosen to follow this was my country and i wanted to make a contribution
7421116 there were lots of threats but i stood my ground
7421117 now ive no reason to feel guilty i can look black people in the eyes because i was a freedom fighter too
7421118 i had an amazing opportunity to have breyten breytenbach in the next cell i benefited from apartheid but i did my small part in trying to fight it
7421119 i told him i hoped he would be out of a job soon because i wanted to live in a world without armies he just laughed
7421120 we desperately need reconciliation to come together and find out more about each other
7421121 this helped the push to democracy we disempowered the south african government we were a major threat because we were coming from within
7421122 thanks to the ecc the conscription issue was settled very quickly
7421123 i like saying to my nephews and i do boast a bit that its because of me that you dont have to go into the military
7421124 outstanding contribution to the struggle against apartheid and sexual discrimination
7421125 how long do you think it would take to kill all 150 of us it would be a bloodbath
7421126 when you have good guys with guns the bad guys do less damage
7421127 weve had a very disturbing trend of school shootings in the us
7421128 it is my belief this is caused by making schools gun free zones when schools were made gun free zones they became targets for people who wanted to rack up the body count
7421129 its up there with the worst ideas in the history of education
7421130 you could have a gun accidentally taken away or a gun could be dislodged or discharged while a teacher is breaking up a fight in the cafeteria
7421131 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defence if other security measures at the school fail
7421132 officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts

7421146 russia has no right to establish checkpoints in georgia the ceasefire agreement is the only agreement that is still alive all others are broken

7421154 vb magazine maart 1991 cd amp v een zogenaamd christen democratische partij is beslist in vreemd vaarwater terechtgekomen
7421155 dit is het land dat aan de vlamingen grote inspanningen vraagt voor zogenaamde solidariteit de geldstroom van vlaanderen naar walloni is als een
7421156 terwijl het net belangrijk is dat nationalisten het racisme afwijzen
7421157 bij elke andere partij zou ik het knullig en ouderwets vinden wij hebben ook twee gekleurde meisjes poe poe maar bij een partij als de n va vind ik het moedig
7421158 ik geloof hartstochtelijk in de vooruitgang maar het blijft onvolkomen het is nooit wat het moet zijn het moet sneller en beter dan we nu doen er is nood aan duwen en sneller vooruitgaan
7421159 u hebt daar een interessant punt we zouden daar iets aan kunnen doen door ons verkiezingssysteem structureel en drastisch te hervormen
7421160 dat is guy ten voeten uit de wereld veranderen is voor hem zo mogelijk nog belangrijker dan zijn idee n verwezenlijken destijds deed hij dat vanuit het receptenboekje vandaag is het meer doorleefd maar altijd die basisveronderstelling als we niet vooruitgaan gaan we achteruit
7421161 hij is de ultieme modernist wil steeds de tijdgeest vatten en vernieuwen die honger blijft onvoorstelbaar groot na dertig jaar het is wat hem draaiende houdt zijn zuurstof de bron waardoor hij soms zo onuitstaanbaar energiek blijft kijk naar leterme en vande lanotte je ziet nu al de stress van de campagne op hun gezichten guy staat er na dertig jaar toppolitiek frisser bij dan zij
7421162 hij moet en zal de wereld veranderen dat het heelal niet voor dit leven zal zijn zal hij maar node aanvaarden
7421163 is dat zo ja lacht maar het leven is toch voren trekken zaaien oogsten de mens vooruit laten gaan de zaken beter doen draaien
7421164 ja ik zou het niet anders kunnen want dan is het niet goed
7421165 ik heb mij dit weekend in een traktaat van ludwig wittgenstein verdiept taalfilosofie en wat die methode zou kunnen bijdragen tot hervormingsprocessen dan vraag je je wel af guy is dit nu echt het moment je zit in campagne lacht maar dat is ook aan de weg timmeren het gaat niet alleen om campagne en ministerraad en beleid maar ook over grondstof opdoen aarde verzamelen compost om verder te kunnen zaaien ik sta daar niet eens bij stil
7421166 ik zal de oudste zijn maar ik ben nog maar 54 jaar toch nog een jonge mens h dat overvalt mij soms wel ja verdomme ben ik al zo lang bezig
7421167 omdat het voor mij eten en drinken is politiek is voor mij niet de agenda van de ministerraad afgaan of een stukje bijbreien aan het partijprogramma voor mij is dat heel divers een speech geven en erop kicken als hij goed is de juiste retoriek vinden een kunst die door de audiovisuele media meer en meer verdwijnt ten gunste van de oneliner maar ook een boek lezen dat je niet kent roger lallemand oud ps senator en boezemvriend van verhofstadt die hij zelfs zonder medeweten van de ps minister van staat liet maken yd lvi heeft me nu net een boek van alain badiou aangepraat een extreem linkse franse filosoof over de geschiedenis van de twintigste eeuw dat is ook politiek proberen te herkaderen nieuwe idee n opdoen gelden de uitgangspunten nog moeten we er geen nieuwe ontdekken de juiste spatie vinden ja wat heeft individualisme met ego sme te maken en moet altru sme per se naar collectivisme leiden bepaalt de geschiedenis onze toekomst of niet dat is politiek daar blijf ik gebiologeerd door niet door hier s morgens om acht uur toe te komen en je dossiertjes te doen en alleen dat maakt dat een verschil ik ben daarvan overtuigd ja is het niet morgen dan binnen vijf jaar het alternatief is dat je dichtslibt op een dood spoor terechtkomt nee ik word het niet beu want er is nog zoveel te doen fysiek ga je naar beneden maar intellectueel moet je toch naar boven is er dan een andere weg
7421168 hij is een cubaan meer che nog dan fidel de revolutie op zich is het doel niet eens zozeer waar die toe leidt de romantiek ervan de kick dingen in beweging te kunnen zetten het bestaande moet bestreden en vervangen worden want het is niet mogelijk dat het heden het beste zou kunnen zijn daarom zat hij als een ramptoerist te smakken op het wenceslasplein in praag hij was erbij toen havel het daar overnam van de communisten hij sprong in de auto en reed de nacht door om bij de val van de muur te kunnen zijn hij is een revolutionair in het diepst van zijn gedachten gelukkig is hij geen marxist of er zouden echt ongelukken kunnen gebeuren
7421169 ik zou dat ook niet kunnen zijn de utopie vergeet het de ideale samenleving is misschien te beschrijven maar niet te verwezenlijken ik kan me niet indenken te geloven in absolute maakbaarheid ik wil net het omgekeerde wat zijn de waarden en principes die de mens doen lopen denken werken leven die mens is de maat van alle dingen nooit een systeem alle systemen die zich boven die maat wilden stellen zijn kapotgegaan en gelukkig maar er is geen andere maat dan de mens
7421170 better to burn out than to fade away dat zou zijn levensmotto kunnen zijn en op zijn begrafenis moet jim morrison gedraaid worden we want the world and we want it now wie vindt na dertig jaar na acht jaar premierschap nog de tijd voor een vierde burgermanifest het beste trouwens er staan minder zotternijen in dan in de vorige hij moet steeds het slagveld kunnen overschouwen zoekend naar het idee waarmee hij weer in de spits kan lopen altijd vooruit met de geit en wil dat beest niet mee dan verlegt hij desnoods de grond waarop het staat soms is het echt hallucinant zie je hem over de kaarten met aanvliegroutes gebogen staan begint hij er zelf nieuwe uit te tekenen zelfs als hij zelf in iets niet gelooft kijkt hij in de spiegel en overtuigt hij eerst zichzelf hij zuigt alles op als een spons leest en blijft leren onvermoeibaar hij heeft een groot speelveld nodig waarop hij spelverdeler en spits tegelijk kan zijn een beetje de johan cruijffachtige stijl terwijl leterme veeleer aan marco materazzi doet denken catenaccio incarneert
7421171 hij integreert meteen alle nieuw idee n ook al zijn die niet altijd even consequent onlangs is hij op een stafvergadering met de top een half uur college beginnen te geven over de vierde generatie kernreactoren hij kent daar nu ongeveer evenveel van als de ingenieurs zelf weet welke proffen er top zijn in dat domein wie hij zal gebruiken om dat idee naar de publieke opinie te pitchen dat wij daar op dat moment geen enkele boodschap aan hebben omdat we de campagne georganiseerd proberen te krijgen deert hem niet
7421172 zijn vermogen zichzelf heruit te vinden persoonlijk en politiek is redelijk fenomenaal de burgermanifesten de oprichting van de vld de rwandacommissie zaal f in de senaat telkens staat hij er weer anders en toch is hij nooit een karikatuur van zichzelf geworden de croo speelt de croo guy is zichzelf gebleven
7421173 persoonlijk is hij niet anders eerst begint hij in een villaatje in gent en zet dat in orde dan begint hij aan een modernistische minimalistische balk die hij daar ergens neerlegt om in te wonen en als dat af is koopt hij een oud huis in mariakerke dat hij meer restaureert dan verbouwt er waar hij weer de ziel en het patina van toen aan wil geven hij koopt dan tientallen oude deuren op rommelmarkten en bij antiquairs en past die in dat huis in hooguit zal hij ze wat fixeren zodat je niet te vuil wordt als je ertegen loopt zijn vrouw dominique wordt er zot van maar het resultaat is wel magnifiek in toscane is hij nu ook al aan zijn tweede bouwproject bezig en ook daar lagen de oude deuren stapels dik op het erf
7421174 mogen we misschien als eerste vraag eventueel weten wat uw favoriete nummer van de rolling stones is
7421175 hij blijft op zijn 54ste het jongetje hij wil ook maar niet gaan schrijden niet de presidenti le allure hebben die een mark eyskens al sinds zijn zesde levensjaar bezit
7421176 ik heb hem eigenlijk nog nooit een gezagsargument weten te gebruiken telkens is het overtuigen op je inpraten tot je je goed in je vel gaat voelen omdat hij zoveel tijd in je steekt zo zijn best doet en je geeft je gewonnen voor je het weet of je denkt dat je gelijk gekregen hebt terwijl hij je eigenlijk net in je zak gestoken heeft
7421177 ik ben bij nogal wat gesprekken geweest waar guy zogezegd aan iemand iets beloofd heeft
7421178 hij heeft de charme van een rattenvanger roept soms de fascinatie op die je ook voor een roofdier voelt en aan de andere kant weet hij ook een groepsgeest en een warmte te evoceren in de partij in de ministerraad als het nodig is met grappen in het plat gents en imitaties van zichzelf vol zelfspot
7421179 soms roofdierachtig ja hoe hij nu leterme beloert klaar om toe te slaan te vermorzelen te vernederen hoe durf jij van de 16 te dromen je ziet het hem denken wat hij met annemie neyts yd lvi heeft gedaan en met karel de gucht yd lvi als het om verhofstadt zelf gaat zijn autoriteit en zijn leiderschap kan hij echt gruwelijk kil en genadeloos zijn
7421180 hij lokt bewondering uit hij is ook nooit cynisch geworden in tegenstelling tot alle anderen hij wordt niet bezoedeld door de geschiedenis en de negatieve ervaringen rancune is hem vreemd zeker persoonlijke hij hakt het hoofd van de gucht af en maakt hem dan later minister van buitenlandse zaken ook al omdat op die manier zijn vriend johan van hecke weer in het europees parlement kon gaan zetelen iedereen toch content vindt hij dan als karel het dan schitterend doet op die post is verhofstadt zeer fier niet eens zozeer op karel maar op zichzelf omdat hij dat toch weer fantastisch opgelost en gecast heeft lacht een narcist ja ken je er andere aan de top
7421181 eigenlijk doet hij je dromen over jezelf zowat iedereen die ik ken in de politiek ziet in verhofstadt de politicus die hij eigenlijk zelf had willen zijn maar waarvoor onze beentjes te kort zijn meer te zijn dan de beheerder van dossiers een stempel op de geschiedenis nalaten meer te zijn dan boekhouder van de res publica maar er de vormgever van zijn daarom laat je je inspinnen in zijn charme daarom haat je hem soms ook
7421182 hij is het ultieme zondagskind het jongetje dat nooit het echt grote leed gekend heeft gebukt ging onder zichzelf of de wereld hij heeft nooit de tragiek van martens meegemaakt met zijn kinderen nooit die van dehaene die kleinkinderen verloor die gebukt ging onder zijn fysiek zijn huidziekte en zijn voorkomen ook voor die mannen kon je bewondering opbrengen maar je zou voor geen goud in hun schoenen hebben willen staan maar guy straalt onbevangen geluk uit dat is de sleutel van zijn charisma
7421183 zullen we wachten tot 10 juni om te zien of dat nog werkt
7421184 even stil ik sta daar misschien te weinig bij stil ja
7421185 ik denk niet dat ik een roofdier ben de steppenwolf van herman hesse wordt dan altijd geciteerd een van de lievelingsboeken uit mijn jeugd maar dat is geen klassiek roofdier dat is de eenling buiten de kudde de steppenwolf trekt eenzaam rond straalt melancholie uit dat is wat elke jonge adolescent op een bepaald ogenblik voelt waarin hij zich herkent maar het is een fase het gaat voorbij al hou je er in meer of mindere mate waarschijnlijk wel iets van over het is niet omdat ik in de politiek zit dat alle menselijke kenmerken me vreemd zouden zijn zoals sommigen menen te vermoeden
7421186 natuurlijk is hij narcistisch het heelal is uitgevonden voor hem dat beschouwt hij overigens niet eens als een persoonlijke verdienste dat is gewoon een gegeven feit lacht een mateloze ambitie ook de ultieme ratio van guy verhofstadt is guy verhofstadt kom daar niet aan of je hebt vodden daar moet alles voor wijken idee n personen structuren zacht als het kan hard als het moet dan is het echt numero uno met alle afstotelijke en lieflijke kantjes van dien
7421187 freya die in humo weet te melden dat ze karel zo mogelijk een nog fijnere man vindt dan guy dat hakt erin bij hem ben ik zeker van
7421188 hij wil graag gezien worden iedereen wil dat maar hij meer dan bovengemiddeld het is niet dat hij een dikke nek heeft hij heeft niet dat verschrikkelijke arrogante van een leterme die niet eens een ambt nodig heeft om zo te worden in toscane leeft hij permanent in slacks en polos scheert hij zich weken niet zet hem daar op straat met een bord voor hem en je gooit er een euro in want hij ziet er dan uit als de perfecte clochard hoewel ook daar zal hij nooit een jeans dragen
7421189 ook een typisch narcistisch trekje is dat hij een permanente kring rond zich nodig heeft van mensen die hofhouding relais en klankbord spelen het echte dichte netwerk van guy is absoluut niet zo uitgebreid hij leeft met een paar mensen in symbiose in commune hij heeft dat ook nodig probleem is dat zulks niet vol te houden is het is ook onmenselijk die mensen hebben een haat liefdeverhouding met hem je kunt hem immers alleen doorgeven aan anderen aan een administratie als je hem begrijpt weet hoe hij draait je moet ook de niet uitgesproken tussenstappen zelf kunnen invullen je hebt een roeping nodig om voor hem te werken maar zelfs dan houd je het niet vol daar instappen is beseffen ok mijn leven is voor nadien op zijn eigen kabinet zijn er drie mensen die er echt toe doen didier zijn woordvoerder kan na 10 juni best een paar maanden bij een kraker langsgaan die mens kan zijn nek niet meer draaien van alle spanning en stress
7421190 typisch is ook dat de persoonlijke vrienden niets mis kunnen doen een paar mensen verdedigt hij tot in het onzinnige ook al zijn ze niet altijd de beste selectie uit het menselijke geslacht zijn relatie met pierre chevalier dat valt toch niet te begrijpen uit om het even welk politiek motief dat is een maat en maten mogen bij hem stukken meer hij heeft te weinig kritische vrienden die hem dan kunnen tegenhouden hugo claus heeft hem kunnen weerhouden om zijn roman uit te geven een turf van honderden paginas met een paar behoorlijk stomende sekssc nes die hij schreef bij zijn tocht door de woestijn maar veel meer voorbeelden zijn er niet sus verleyen de overleden oud directeur van knack yd lvi was de enige die echt invloed op hem had
7421191 er is geen nieuwe sus nee omdat er geen twee sussen denkbaar zijn sus was lang stil waar moet ik beginnen hij was een beetje alles belezen erudiet altijd op zoek naar nieuwe tendensen verandering hij kon aanbidden wat hij eerder afgevallen had en omgekeerd een echte renaissancemens een intellectuele duizendpoot dat konden soms heel korte passies zijn maar hij bracht ze altijd met de mooiste formulering we waren twee zielen die elkaar heel goed aanvoelden een paar keer per jaar trokken we met de auto een paar dagen weg naar waar wisten we niet we kwamen wel ergens uit en dan maar praten babbelen redeneren discussi ren over van alles en nog wat waar ik spijt van heb hij praatte toen al veel over muziek en literatuur en dat was terra incognito voor mij ik was destijds alleen en alleen met politiek bezig we zogen elkaar leeg hij mij over politiek ik hem over kunst we waren elkaars pispalen ja voor mij was hij een soulmate zijn dood was een arm die werd afgesneden iets vitaals voor een stukje ben ik verweesd achtergebleven hij is niet vervangbaar ik heb die vriendschap zodanig intens beleefd dat ik altijd alles daaraan afmeet dat is je norm geworden ik heb waarschijnlijk nog wel vrienden maar de lat ligt heel hoog ja misschien heeft iedereen maar n echt grote vriend
7421192 maar dat is wat anders daar kan ik echt pedant over zijn dat klopt
7421193 vergeet dat maar hij doceert en blijft doceren over sushi sashimi tempura brunellos en bij uitbreiding iedere wijngaard van itali autos van bugattis via alfas tot audis oude deuren architectuur en design toscane en ik vergeet een paar dingen
7421194 soms werkt dat ook ik vergeet nooit de dag dat de bazen van opel hier zaten hij leek zon jongetje met een plakboek vol autostickers binnen de kortste keren kan hij hen overtuigen dat hij ook een autogek is net als zij al was het maar door smakelijk het levensverhaal van de stichter van bugatti te vertellen en het verschil tussen audi en alfa in vijf emotionele kernbegrippen te duiden om vervolgens de audits van al hun vestigingen erbij te nemen te laten zien dat hij van ieder de rendementscijfers tot na de komma kent en hen dan te overtuigen dat verdere productie in antwerpen op termijn een veel beter idee is dan een bouw van een nieuwe fabriek in roemeni of weet ik waar het is echt freaky om hem dan bezig te zien maar opel en ford staan er nog wel renault is weg niet
7421195 hij heeft kinderen gekregen voor het eerst een verantwoordelijkheid die hemzelf oversteeg dat heeft zijn frisheid niet afgebot maar er gelukkig wel voor gezorgd dat het drammerige eraf is gegaan hij is milder geworden lees er gewoon de burgermanifesten na elkaar op na maar hij zal de nooit de notaris worden van de ministerraad hij blijft steeds de advocaat de overtuiger
7421196 hij heeft het vermogen de waarheid te veranderen toen hij het had over het uit de staat stappen het meest waanzinnige idee uit zijn carri re had de standaard het over een provocerend en beklijvend idee je moet het maar doen h
7421197 hij voelt perfect the next big idea heeft het voor de anderen gezien en bezet het ook al staat het desnoods niet echt op n lijn met zijn vorige opstellingen neem nu de klimaatopwarming van al gore hij accepteert het en gaat het prompt belichamen
7421198 ok hij schippert is niet altijd even recht in de leer zeker niet op punten die hem in wezen geen bal interesseren zoals de staatshervorming maar als je ziet hoe hij op de grondlijnen het individu tegen de groep de moderniteit tegen het ancien regime de vrije wilsbeschikking tegen de godsdienst de open wereld tegen het protectionisme op alle vlakken al dertig jaar een consistent discours houdt hij heeft zijn gedachtegoed tot een filosofie gemaakt in vlaanderen veel meer dan het veredelde middenstandsdenken van zijn voorgangers hij heeft er nieuwe doelgroepen voor aangeboord en ze overtuigd de ideologie gaat hem vooraf ook dat onderscheidt hem van de meeste anderen ik overdrijf maar een beetje als ik hem de cardijn van het moderne liberalisme noem
7421199 politiek is de voorbije twintig jaar weinig ge volueerd toch er zijn niet zoveel nieuwe inzichten ontstaan in de politiek meestal komen ze van daarbuiten het ideologische tijdperk is waarschijnlijk definitief voorbij de grote politieke tegenstellingen bestaan niet meer de grote politieke vraagstukken moeten niet langer worden uitgevochten ik denk dat ik zelf minder ideologisch denk dan vroeger ook al omdat een paar van mijn idee n van toen privatisering activering ondertussen mainstream zijn geworden zodat je ze niet langer te vuur en te zwaard moet verdedigen het is een misvatting te denken dat er daarom geen politieke existenti le discussie meer mogelijk is of niet meer nodig zou zijn de natuur van de strijd het kader de tegenstellingen veranderen en ik denk dat ze vandaag veel moeilijker onderkend worden dan in het verleden als summum van hoogmoed daarvoor kan de titel van fukuyama gelden het einde van de geschiedenis weet je nog als je dat vandaag bekijkt kan dat wel tellen
7421200 ik heb sus zien vertrekken mijn vader ik zie de aftakeling soms in de vriendenkring je wordt je bewuster van de vergankelijkheid de werkelijke wereld en het leven het maakt je allemaal milder je raakt van het idee af dat alles in wit of zwart te catalogiseren valt het fanatieke gaat eraf omdat alles veel complexer en genuanceerder is dan wanneer je 25 bent het gevaar ligt bij mensen die de omgekeerde weg maken
7421201 toen stond je daar niet bij stil je deed het iedereen uit de weg mijn weg
7421202 kijk naar de franse intellectuelen in de jaren zestig en hun liefde voor het communisme terwijl iedereen het toen toch al kon weten waarom deden ze niets wat kan de politiek doen met stapjes en beetjes wetend dat het ideaal onbereikbaar is op een wolk gezeten is het makkelijker te aanschouwen dan als je midden op het slagveld staat dat weet ik ook wel maar waarom heeft de generatie van onze ouders niet meer gedaan tegen dat oostblok hoe heeft men zo laks tegenover dat ijzeren gordijn kunnen zijn tegenover de berlijnse muur al die roemenen tsjechen en oost duitsers hebben het zelf moeten doen het is vandaag ontegensprekelijk beter dan 300 jaar geleden materieel ethisch democratisch noem maar op maar we hebben de afgelopen eeuw ook het grootste aantal collectieve slachtoffers uit de geschiedenis voortgebracht we doen niets tegen oprukkende epidemie n ook al hebben we wel wat remedies ik geloof in de vooruitgang hartstochtelijk zelfs maar het blijft onvolkomen het is nooit wat het moet zijn het moet beter en sneller dan hoe we het nu doen er is nood aan duwen sneller vooruitgaan betrapt daar ga ik weer de aard van het beestje zeker
7421203 blair heeft thatcher verder uitgevoerd toch links rechts dat is voorbij niemand vraagt toch nog dat de productiemiddelen genationaliseerd moeten worden ja of je een passieve dan wel een actieve sociale zekerheid nodig hebt toch iedereen is het daarover eens die vragen zijn toch allemaal beantwoord elk tijdperk zoekt zijn tegenstelling en nu is het paradigma het open versus het gesloten wereldbeeld ik moet van gent zijn gij zijt van mechelen en pas op voor alles wat vreemd is houd die polen en die indiase kenniswerkers zo lang mogelijk buiten pas op h want we gaan delokaliseren en alles gaat hier verdwijnen we hebben zwaarder protectionisme nodig dat soort onzin of de meest afschrikwekkende angst we zullen onze identiteit verliezen door een ander geloof door de migratie dat constante aanpraten van angst schrik afgunst dat muurtjes optrekken de cohesiedwang het terugtrekken op de eigen sociale groep want het ik kan zich slechts verhouden tot de groep en bestaat anders niet schrijft de huisideoloog van cd amp v wouter beke dat is toch een negatie van honderden jaren verlichting natuurlijk is de groep belangrijk maar toch niet belangrijker dan het individu in de heilige schrift staat bemin uw naaste er staat niet in bemin uw groep de bijbel zelf is dus verdorie meer individualistisch dan wouter beke de slinger gaat in de richting van de gesloten samenleving ondervind ik ook op iedere europese raad want de pool is de pool de deen de deen en de brit zal nooit zijn pond opgeven want dan zou hij een stuk van zijn identiteit zijn zekerheid moeten opgeven dat is de trend ja en ik vecht daartegen
7421204 voor electorale redenen is die strategie alvast niet goed gebleken schatert daar is niets aan te doen het is een van de nadelen van de manier waarop ik werk door mezelf permanent met de rug tegen de muur te zetten maar objectief niet politiek perceptief zal mijn resultaat wel beter zijn dan van degene die op het puur haalbare compromis werkt zo slecht draait het hier toch niet de economische groei is er de 200 000 banen waarover gaat het uiteindelijk achtentwintig gevangenen in dendermonde dat is dan de bottomline van het verhaal ook al zijn dat 120 minder ontsnappingen dan vroeger zou leterme ervoor zijn gaan staan of wat perceptie zwijg me ervan
7421205 het is gewoon de realiteit het enige waarover je het nog mag hebben
7421206 de meeste beloften zijn ook uitgevoerd de politie van oorlog naar effici ntie voedselcrisissen toen van de een naar de ander nu geen enkele meer van collectieve gratieverklaringen naar te overvolle gevangenissen strafuitvoering weg van politici massaal ge nvesteerd in alternatieve straffen elektronische handboeien acht jaar geleden nul valt stil schiet in de lach ik ben hier aan het repeteren voor een debat natuurlijk doe je meer stof opwaaien als je bezig bent ik wil dat en dat en ook nog dat en dan heb je dingen die wel beginnen te functioneren eentje dat langzaam in gang schiet en nog onvolmaakt is en nog eentje waarmee het niet wil lukken je wordt afgerekend op die laatste twee dat is onafwendbaar en dat zal ook onder leterme net hetzelfde zijn nee verbetering onder leterme zal het stukken minder zijn
7421207 hij had op zijn engels onkelinx of reynders moeten kunnen ontslaan maar dat lukt in dit land natuurlijk niet zonder de regering te laten vallen ja dan zit je afgevangen net zoals leterme mocht hij de 16 halen dan afgevangen zal zitten
7421208 hij krijgt soms het krediet niet dat hij verdient dat er vandaag na zeventig jaar verlieslatend sabena opnieuw een rendabele vliegmaatschappij vanuit zaventem opereert met haast evenveel passagiers is eigenlijk zijn verdienste hijzelf heeft al die industri len gebeld om hen te overtuigen startkapitaal op te hoesten hij heeft toen om drie uur s nachts prodi uit zijn bed gebeld premier zou je dat wel doen die mens slaapt nu die staat in zijn pyjama niets aan te doen prodi moest en zou aan de lijn komen om te verzekeren dat er geen europese concurrentieproblemen konden komen
7421209 iedereen kon die eerste twee jaar iedereen schaakmat zetten in de regering en iedereen deed dat ook met overtuiging
7421210 de eerste fout was een te snel onderhandeld regeerakkoord waarbij ze het migrantenstemrecht aan het parlement gaven van read my lips naar een zekere nederlaag het was niet meer te vermijden toen hadden ze moeten slikken en doorgaan er niet die martelgang van maken ook grote leiders maken fouten bleek toen wat ook meespeelt niemand van de top was intellectueel tegen dat stemrecht vandaar dat ze er geen echt punt van hebben gemaakt tijdens de regeringsonderhandelingen
7421211 dan krijg je het koningsdrama karel zocht voortdurend autonomie voor de partij naast de regering wat hem voor guy deed uitgroeien van criticus tot pure ambetanterik het koningsdrama was de ontploffing de catharsis de boel was al naar de kloten toen karel heeft nooit willen inzien dat de partij van de premier niet autonoom kan zijn alles in samenspraak met guy moet doen en slechts dissident kan zijn binnen de krijtlijnen die hij stelt anders werkt het niet
7421212 daarbovenop beginnen ze vrolijk bananenschillen rond te strooien dingen waarvan ze weten dat ze onoplosbaar zijn b h v is ons gewoon tactisch klemrijden wij moeten dat onderhandelen met de overkant zij hoeven alleen de mislukking te noteren verhofstadt had dat niet op tijd door maar waarom zouden ze hem verhinderen om tegen de muur te lopen bij de geluidsnormen had hij het eindelijk wel vast dit kan ik niet oplossen beste vrienden het is ook niet mijn verantwoordelijkheid los het zelf op ondertussen loopt leterme rustig twee jaar campagne te voeren zonder het te moeten zeggen want hij was geen kandidaat toch
7421213 en ondertussen amuseren we ons kostelijk met dedecker blijven we jaren intern zwalpen ook al had iedere hond met een hoed op in die context 34 procent gehaald en dat had de trojka moeten beseffen dat de basis hun even de vinger wilde tonen maar ja bang voor het schisma bang voor alles waren ze terwijl die kerel ons hypersluw want dat is hij wel verder in de vernieling reed
7421214 we hebben ook niet de cultuur om mensen buiten te zetten de man had een zekere legitimiteit in de partij de top drie was aangeslagen na het koningsdrama we hadden ook klop gekregen in 2004 weken en maanden nadien was de basis kwaad op de top dedecker raakte die basisgevoeligheid en werd voor velen een verklaringsschema we moesten naar rechts je installeert het mentale schisma heeft hij echte aanhang dekt hij echt een flank af is hij onder controle te houden de enige die juist zat in zijn analyse was karel maar die ademde toen te veel gekwetstheid uit om serieus genomen te worden zo is het een langzaam groeiproces geworden achteraf bekeken veel te langzaam
7421215 zijn erfenis is niet slecht we zijn niet de zieke man van europa zoals frankrijk alle begrotings economische en sociale parameters zijn beter dan acht jaar geleden een historisch lage werkloosheid de snelst groeiende economie in jaren hij heeft ons niet meegesleept in de irakoorlog zoals blair er zijn geen levensbeschouwelijke conflicten zoals in nederland er zijn in die acht jaar geen verscheurende besparingen geweest geen beleid waarvoor je het verdient afgestraft te worden maar ja ook churchill is door de kiezer naar huis gestuurd toen hij net de tweede wereldoorlog had gewonnen
7421216 dat is het drama van de persoonlijkheid van verhofstadt die hij afstraalt op de hele top altijd maar weer vooruit vooruit opzwepen nooit een moment van bezinning en rust dat verklaart zijn resultaten en tegelijk zijn mislukkingen zowel migrantenstemrecht als dedecker hadden vermeden kunnen worden als er maar iemand de gave had gehad om even te temporiseren zich af te vragen zijn we wel goed bezig als hij het niet haalt op 10 juni is dat misschien een mooi politiek grafschrift guy verhofstadt de man die niet kon surplacen

7421344 i also find it interesting that the trans women online support the sex industry or at least the women who choose to participate in it
7421345 i dont think for a minute that any feminist thinks its

7421830 he has to serve his sentence theres a rationale in my view why pollard should be given leniency but there is not a rationale to say what happened did not happen and should be pardoned

7421850 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7421851 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7421852 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7421853 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7421854 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7421855 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7421856 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7421857 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7421858 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7421859 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7421860 our first priority going into these games was to compete clean and we are extremely proud that our athletes are sharing our commitment to this principle they represented our country with pride and honor and with one of the best u s olympic performances in history
7421861 i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7421862 if i got it i got it but its supposed to be fair play theyre supposed to go by the rules

7421872 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7421873 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7421874 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team
7421875 we knew coming in that spain was going to be a big problem

7421879 the fed note is essentially unsound it is the worst currency and the most dangerous that this country has ever known when the proponents of the act saw that the democratic doctrine would not permit them to let the proposed banks issue the new currency as bank notes they should have stopped at that they should not have foisted that kind of currency namely an asset currency on the united states government they should not have made the government liable on the private debts of individuals and corporations and least of all on the private debts of foreigners
7421880 the imperial power of elasticity of the public currency is wielded exclusively by the central corporations owned by the banks i e the regional federal reserve banks this is a life and death power over all local banks and all business it can be used to create or destroy prosperity to ward off or cause stringencies and panics by making money artifi cially scarce interest rates throughout the country can be arbitrarily raised and the bank tax on all business and cost of living increased for the profi t of the banks owning these regional central banks and without the slightest benefi t to the people the twelve corporations together cover and monopolize and use for private gain every dollar of the public currency and all public revenue of the united states not a dollar can be put into circulation among the people by their government without the consent of and on terms fixed by these twelve private money trusts

7421889 professional demolition where they set the charges on certain floors and then you hear pop pop pop pop

7421943 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
7421944 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
7421945 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies

7421947 obama ready to raise your taxes but is he ready to lead im john mccain and i approved this message
7421948 a man who lives in a box for five years can do whatever he wants
7421949 he has been preoccupied with escaping the shadow of his father and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others
7421950 he feels his experiences and performance as a p o w have finally permitted this to happen
7421951 what is true is that a number of p o w s in those first few years after their release often acted erratically their lives pockmarked by drastic mood swings and uncharacteristic behavior before achieving a more mellow equilibrium
7421952 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7421953 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7421954 the senator has even brought his military record into discussion of his music tastes explaining that his favorite song was dancing queen by abba he offered that his knowledge of music stopped evolving when his plane intercepted a surface to air missile dancing queen however was produced in 1975 eight years after mccains plane was shot down
7421955 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7421956 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7421957 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7421958 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7421959 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7421960 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7421961 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7421962 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7421963 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7421964 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7421965 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7421966 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7421967 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7421968 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7421969 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7421970 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country

7421993 to me sidestepper is an aural recognition and representation of the importance and social significance of true creolization the true merging of human efforts to learn one from another and build on the accomplishments of each other without ignoring or eliminating the existence of one aspect in favor of the elevation of another aspect

7422006 lost even the memory of those bands of warriors who sought to be more than human on whom magico military initiation was supposed to confer supernatural powers and whose likeness was presented very much later by scandinavia with its berserkers and by ireland with its fianna

7422083 how can i use my shopping cart to beef up my online sales
7422084 i want there to be a interventionist christian god and you cant prove there isnt one
7422085 if faith could be attained solely by reason and correct evaluation of the evidence it would not be faith at all
7422086 is it reasonable do we have good reasons to affirm our belief in god upon faith
7422087 for five points explain what moses actually saw in exodus 33 23 and i will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen
7422088 as much evidence to believe as there is not to believe
7422089 there are indeed things that cannot be put into words they make themselves manifest they are what is mystical
7422090 yes if god revealed himself to each of us wed have to believe and that would be horrible right why would god actually want us to have some evidence to believe that would take away the entire game of getting to torture people forever if they didnt just accept all kinds of things that there is no evidence for
7422091 as for god being malicious i think that would be the only conclusion if there is a god either that or he doesnt care the world runs like there is no god so he would be one hell of a trickster who delights in suffering if he really is around but thanks to science and free markets were well on our way to less suffering good thing we have scientists who find cures because god if he exists is obviously not going to help get us out of the mess he put us in
7422092 if god revealed himself to us we would not have free will
7422093 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego

7422099 i am always enjoying sitting comfortably in the glazed house i usually order a glass of drink but today i had a dinner here the dishes are very delicious some were very creative most are mild and in accordance with the modern healthful notion the pastries are quite tasty and remind me of the homemade food in england
7422100 since it is quiet here i am accustomed to have a drink with my friends at weekends in the caf
7422101 china famous snack qiao jia shan tang bao but also the red instruction on how to eat soup dumpling invites the customers to savor the
7422102 after tasting all kinds of soup dumpling or xiao long bao in shanghai i still particularly love here
7422103 the dumplings are delicious and coming here has also become one of our habitual gathering
7422104 i cant tell you our recipe but its true that its best and people love it
7422105 i invited many senior cooks from the headquarter of the restaurant so that our soup dumpling is different from other branches
7422106 oh sorry since its rare to find young chinese visiting here

7422109 the central idea of the exhibition the architecture of desire is that the kinds of architecture a community builds both reflects that communitys beliefs and shapes its values
7422110 some city governments operate in grand classical buildings others operate in nondescript office buildings in each instance we can make inferences about the importance of government in civic life
7422111 architecture also has the capacity to shape individual and cultural behaviors we behave differently in a church than we do a grocery store
7422112 ok here we go we got a real pressure cooker going here two down nobody on no score here comes the throw and what a throw here he comes squeeze play its gonna be close holy cow i think hes gonna make it

7422115 as a community our job is to teach our kids to live in the world
7422116 is not teaching children how to grow up in the real world
7422117 what we want is everyone always thinking there could be a possibility of an allergic reaction and be on guard for it
7422118 as children get older and more responsible you dont have to have anything like a ban
7422119 you want them to learn to deal with the situation
7422120 we dont ban peanut butter because we feel it is a staple among young children
7422121 you just cant monitor whats in every persons lunch pail
7422122 when people understand theres a life at risk everyone starts to feel a little sympathy
7422123 we know we cant put her in a bubble and send her to school
7422124 ive had utis before so i knew when i got the symptoms i probably had one
7422125 especially for people with chronic diseases like diabetes these point of care tests help people manage their own health care
7422126 but patients should consider them complements not replacements for medical care because they dont take everything into consideration the test doesnt know for example if you are a 20 year old woman or 60 year old man
7422127 the virtual colonoscopy for example can be an alternative to a colonoscopy for someone without risk factors for colon cancer

7422142 it feels great especially since its been a few years since we won this
7422143 being from the lake its particularly special and i have to take my hat off to ron duggan and the shootout committee this has been a great event im really excited to be able to continue the shootout
7422144 this location the size the number of amenities the people and their hospitality and the overall boating experience were awesome
7422145 you should never take this lake for granted its the greatest place ive seen for a boating event like this
7422146 pick a horse and wait for a guide to mount up
7422147 those guys fought back good and we knew they would brown and their quarterback is a good player completed some good passes down there
7422148 we came back from halftime and i thought the kids refocused and we said weve got to go out and play like we did in the first eight minutes and we did i thought the offense went out and played incredibly well defensively we did a great job just a couple of lapses there

7422160 hallmark is jeopardizing its brand as a family friendly company
7422161 customers used to be able to trust hallmark to produce quality products that were safe for all ages
7422162 now parents will need to steer their kids from hallmarks section of the greeting card aisle and away from its previously heart warming movies for fear that they too will push homosexual messages
7422163 by latching onto the latest fad generated by the homosexual special interest groups hallmark is negating its image as a wholesome company that promotes american values and pro family principles in its products
7422164 american businesses have a corporate responsibility to the public that buys their products
7422165 instead of bolstering campaigns by special interest groups like the homosexual activists corporations like hallmark should be protecting american culture from those forces that would destroy the family and create a public environment that is detrimental to general well being especially childrens well being

7422206 she came into my life unexspectedly just as she has left me this precious little angel from above gave me strength and unconditional love now she is gone and i dont know why all i am guilty of is loving her and providing her a safe home jealousy has taken her away jealousy from the one person that should be thankfull for all of the love and support given to her a mothers love is deep however there are limits when one is betrayed by the one she loved and trusted the most a daughter comes to her mother for support when she is pregnant the mother says without hesitation it will be ok and it was but then the lies and betrayal began first it seemed harmless ah love is blind a mother will look for the good in her child and give them a chance to change this mother gave chance after chance for her daughter to change but instead more lies more betrayal what does the mother get for giving her daughter all of these chances a broken heart the daughter who stole money lots of money leaves without warning and does not let her mother now speak to the baby that her mother raised fed clothed sheltered paid her medical bills etc instead tells her friends that her mother is controlling her life and she needs her space no money no future where did she go who is now watching out for the little angel

7422280 legend here has it that luanda magere was an invincible luo warrior who led his people in tribal scuffles against their nandi neighbours the nandi decided to send a beautiful girl to luanda mageres neighbourhood he fell for her and married her his first wife saw this as the enemys plot to spy on her husbands invincibility and military prowess but luanda magere dismissed her accusing her of petty jealousy one day he fell ill and summoned the nandi wife to treat him by making little cuts on his body with a blade and rubbing herbs into the bleeding cuts she did this but there was neither a cut nor blood luanda magere then instructed her to make the cuts on the shadow as she did this cuts formed on his body and blood came out with the secret out the wife ran back to her people and told them luanda mageres secret word got out and fearing for his life luanda magere decided to command his army from the base but one time he decided to go to the war front he killed many and repulsed the enemy but one sly nandi warrior hid in the rocks later as luanda magere walked back home victorious the warrior emerged from his hideout and speared his shadow aiming at the heart he instantly turned into a rock with blood gushing out from the heart to date it is believed that one of the rocks with a discernible head shoulder and water running from the place where he was speared is luanda mageres body
7422281 he unleashed a stream of profanities at spooky and me both
7422282 as spooky was getting into the car i finally looked him in the eye and said the only thing i said during the entire encounter which elapsed over the space of maybe three or four minutes start to finish at the most
7422283 i urge anyone else whose had trouble with swan point security to come forward last night i was appalled today the whole affair seems utterly unreal if wed been tagging gravestones or smoking weed or performing some obscene ritual to raise cthulhu even
7422284 escorted defendant to the middle of the street and told him to cross to the sidewalk defendant for the fourth time refused the verbal commands and thats why he was arrested
7422285 by the time we got back from the honeymoon we found out she only had weeks to months to live
7422286 hearing the news was like someone had literally torn our hearts out and everything we had planned together had just been shattered
7422287 i remember lying on the hospital floor in the fetal position just bawling i literally wanted to die
7422288 i just kept calling out lord theres no reason right now why i should live
7422289 in one sense i saw her suffer through so much and was glad she was with the lord but i realized i was angry at god for taking her it just didnt make sense
7422290 whenever something tragic happens people tend to think about their relationship with god regardless of how strong or weak it has been in the past
7422291 whether their faith is strong or not everyone has a tendency to blame god when something bad happens and they can get very angry at him but gods big enough to handle that type of response as hes the one in the end who can ultimately get them through the ordeal
7422292 thats when my breath was truly taken and fear came over me
7422293 a dive team began the search and for three hours i just sat in the back of a restaurant crying out jesus help me as i prayed for trents safety
7422294 i was just shaking just out of breath desperately crying out to god
7422295 as i was crying out to god to send an angel a housekeeping lady at the hotel knocked on my door
7422296 the maid said i could hear you crying and ive been trying to get to you could i hold you the women wrapped her arms around me began to pray for me and just kept holding me god had sent an angel to me in a hilton hotel outfit at that very moment
7422297 when somebody has been sick for a long time their loved ones have the opportunity to pre grieve the illness and death
7422298 when a person loses someone to a sudden accident the grief is much more intense and theres even more of a shock factor to deal with
7422299 we were having problems and we separated but i truly felt we could both get counseling and start fresh
7422300 i was still emotionally attached despite the separation until he told me about being with other women some of whom i knew that was the most devastating thing i ever experienced
7422301 the rejection factor plays a big part in making divorce harder to deal with for some
7422302 it makes them feel like half a person like half of their identity is lost struggling with that is likely to bring a past relational problem back to the surface
7422303 i was such a scared and wounded person at that point and kept asking myself am i even loveable
7422304 i was by her bedside 24 7 and even though i had time to prepare for her death i still wasnt ready to let her go
7422305 i knew the only way i could go on was to accept gods wisdom and perfect timing and try to see things from his perspective
7422306 its really helped me to share what a great person trent was on this earth and also how gods bringing me through the storm of no longer having him here
7422307 but its still a daily battle there are moments when i feel like ive been punched in the stomach because i miss him so much
7422308 i still buy a card for her and i take the money id normally spend on her gift and donate it to the hospital where she stayed in her final days
7422309 im at a point now where ive accepted that god may or may not have someone out there for me but like those who attend the support group i need to focus on maintaining healthy relationships with the opposite sex and growing in community with others
7422310 my biggest piece of advice is for people to spend quiet time reflecting on all thats happened to them
7422311 even in my deepest period of grief i sat still and listened for god sometimes it was hard to pray and i didnt even want to but his strength is perfect and theres always hope
7422312 mereka minta fatwa kepadamu tentang kalalah katakanlah allah memberi fatwa kepadamu tentang kalalah
7422313 demi allah saya lebih takut kepada allah dari pada kamu saya lebih takwa kepada allah dari pada kamu meskipun demikian saya puasa dan berbuka shalat tidur dan kawin dengan perempuan siapa yang tidak suka dengan cara yang saya lakukan berarti ia tidak termasuk umatku
7422314 menhimpun al quran dalam satu mushhaf adalah paling baik dan sesuai dengan kemaslahatan islam
7422315 allah sekali kali tidak menjadikan untuk kamu dalam agama suatu kesempitan
7422316 apa yang dipandang baik oleh orang orang islam maka baik juga di sisi allah dan apa yang dipandang buruk oleh orang orang islam maka buruk juga di sisi allah
7422317 apa yang sudah berlaku sebagai adat kebiasaan adalah sama dengan yang ditetapkan oleh dalil argumen dari syariat islam
7422318 dialah allah yang menciptakan segala yang ada di bumi untuk kamu
7422319 hukum memanfaatkan semua kekayaan di bumi adalah boleh kecuali ada dalil argumen yang menunjukkan tidak boleh
7422320 janganlah kamu memaki sembahan sembahan yang mereka sembah selain allah karena mereka nanti akan memaki allah dengan melampaui batas tanpa pengetahuan

7422323 some eleven million people need food aid in the region after poor rains
7422324 it is deeply hypocritical there should be lavishing course after course on world leaders when there is a food crisis and millions cant afford to eat if the g8 wants to betray the hopes of a generation of children its going the right way about it
7422325 the g8 have made a bad start to their summit with excessive cost and lavish consumption all of us are watching waiting and listening
7422326 rich world politicians are failing to acknowledge the impact of their own unfair policies
7422327 the key is not just financing but fast delivery systems as well

7422333 dont take yourself too seriously we are small we are nothing so always be ready to give everything
7422334 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7422335 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7422336 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7422337 we as a government are committed to taking tough decisions and tough action for the economys long term interest and also for the environments long term interest
7422338 part of that is acting responsibly on climate change and part of that in turn means acting through a pollution reduction scheme

7422347 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
7422348 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
7422349 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
7422350 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
7422351 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well

7422435 but i have asserted a firm conviction a conviction rooted in my faith in god and my faith in the american people that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union for the african american community that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past it means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of american life but it also means binding our particular grievances for better health care and better schools and better jobs to the larger aspirations of all americans the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling the white man who has been laid off the immigrant trying to feed his family and it means taking full responsibility for our own lives by demanding more from our fathers and spending more time with our children and reading to them and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives they must never succumb to despair or cynicism they must always believe that they can write their own destiny

7422442 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7422443 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7422444 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7422445 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7422446 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7422447 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7422448 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7422449 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7422450 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7422451 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy

7422454 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7422455 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7422456 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make

7422513 this is the first of the rules that diplomacy can neglect only at the risk of war
7422514 if you want a war nourish a doctrine doctrines are the most frightful tyrants to which men ever are subject because doctrines get inside of a mans own reason and betray him against himself
7422515 if the objectives of foreign policy are not to be defined in terms of a world embracing political religion how are they to be defined this is the fundamental problem to be solved once the crusading aspirations of nationalistic universalism have been discarded
7422516 the national interest of a peace loving nation can only be defined in terms of national security and national security must be defined as integrity of the national territory and of its institutions national security then is the irreducible minimum that diplomacy must defend with adequate power without compromise and even at risk of war
7422517 what are the national interests of other nations in terms of their national security and are they compatible with ones own

7422568 pada hari itu 15 ogos saya saya diarahkan oleh orang atasan saya untuk menjadi saksi sumpah saiful bukhari saya antara empat orang imam yang diarahkan untuk menjadi saksi
7422569 sumpah itu bukan saya yang aturkan teksnya disediakan oleh peguamnya atau mungkin ada orang lain yang buat itu
7422570 apabila dia saiful membacakan teks dia seolah olah tidak merasa bersalah
7422571 kalau kita seorang islam yang beriman kalau kita nak bersumpah ini kita akan takut apa akan terjadi tetapi kerana teks ucapan yang dibacakan itu dia tak rasa bersalah
7422572 sepatutnya dia sebut 26 jun tetapi dia sebut 28 ogos
7422573 saya rasa para pengundi di permatang pauh mungkin ada yang mengenali saya jadi saya berharap jangan saya dipersalahkan boleh tak
7422574 boleh katakan saya ahli umno saya cuma menjadi ahli umno kerana hendak tolong kawan
7422575 saya tidak diperalatkan oleh mana mana pihak pkr sendiri yang jemput untuk saya membuat pengakuan
7422576 kami hanya dihubungi beliau ramlang petang ini dan kami setuju
7422577 akhirnya tembelang orang yang bernama ramlang porigi yang dikatakan imam yang menjadi saksi sumpah mubahalah saiful terdedah juga
7422578 beliau adalah ahli pemuda umno cawangan seri machang dalam bahagian bukit mertajam dengan kod keahlian 03405843
7422579 pelbagai ugutan mula saya terima sejak saya datang ke permatang pauh tetapi dalam tempoh sehari dua ini ugutan yang lebih serius termasuk ancaman bunuh terhadap saya ibu anak serta isteri dihantar kepada saya
7422580 saya akan tetap berada di bumi permatang pauh sehingga 26 ogos ini dan ugutan sedemikian tidak memberi kesan kepada saya
7422581 sebagai bekas orang kanan beliau saya ingatkan pengundi permatang pauh supaya membuang sentimen itu demi negara agama dan bangsa
7422582 saya lama bersama anwar dan tidak ada keluarga yang lebih menderita daripada keluarga saya dan anwar memang tidak mudah juga bagi saya untuk melupakan apa yang saya perjuangkan tetapi apabila saya menyedari perjuangan anwar terpesong dari landasan saya membuat keputusan mengundur diri kerana sayangkan agama bangsa dan negara
7422583 the major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair
7422584 a common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools
7422585 i had been warned by numerous other writers that the
7422586 it turned out the opposite this was my best experience in writing a movie novel
7422587 i had full access to frank spotnitz who helped me every step of the way
7422588 he even provided wardrobe breakdowns and for a major unscripted sequence i was put in touch with academy award winning editor richard harris who spent several hours on the phone talking me through it
7422589 the script was terrific and i had been a fairly hardcore fan
7422590 mulder scully and skinner are distinct characters and they tend to do the work for you
7422591 i very much wanted to explain some backstory for example whether or not skinner was aware of where mulder and scully were the answer yes i did this stuff independently and ran it by spotnitz who approved everything i did
7422592 but i dont think harpercollins is convinced theres an audience out there the fact that the movie has only been modestly successful amplifies that im afraid
7422593 its important that all x files fans support this film and for that matter the novel
7422594 i know not everyone loves it i happen to think its excellent and will be re evaulated as the years pass but without that support there will not be another x files film much less novel
7422595 siapakah yang layak dipilih dalam keadaan begitu bagi saya pengundi yang matang hendaklah menilai manakah pihak yang paling ringan mudaratnya dibandingkan yang satu lagi

7422679 its a form more common among younger women and african american women
7422680 we wanted to find out what puts women at risk for this
7422681 thats why we cant use hormonal treatments on these tumors
7422682 weve known for a long time that breast feeding reduces your risk of breast cancer and that it was probably related to hormones
7422683 one possible explanation is that while women are breast feeding they arent menstruating and so their hormones arent cycling
7422684 it helps explain why some women are at higher risk and also why certain therapies are not effective against these more aggressive forms of breast cancer

7422690 well be doing a jeremy jones one too in a couple years when he gets ready to retire and were going to do a history of snowboarding piece here in the next year or two obviously we have a lot of footage of tons of people and were going to explore some online stuff and cut some day in the life type pieces as well were going to do some commercials and bigger feature stuff as well as 3 d and just move into some different avenues
7422691 the thing is when youre in the zone as we are when were doing an annual film its pretty much all inclusive it takes an incredible amount of time now to get shots and youre out there all winter and then the winter ends and then youre editing and then right after that its the premier and then it snows early and youre off on some rail trip and get it going again it is pretty hard to do anything unless you just do it ross steffey my main camera guy for forever hes going to be working with me on the new projects and hes really stoked
7422692 the snowboarding films that everyones making if you dont snowboard youre not even gonna be stoked on it theres not much to it that an average person can get out of it when youre talking about telling a story then youre getting into a way bigger audience any time theres human interest involved then that opens the door for tons of people to be interested in it those types of projects have a lot of longevity and theyre more likely to get picked up on tv and go to film festivals and a lot of different people are going to see it and get stoked
7422693 weve obviously been doing it forever and have one of the better reputations people knew that if they sponsored our movies its money well spent we still are making good money on it
7422694 any industry that relies on a digital master and makes copies of it to make money dies by the internet
7422695 it doesnt matter what you do if its a digital item that you can put on a computer and send it around then thats exactly what they do
7422696 people dont know how much effort all the riders and film companies put into this in the end i would have to say that a lot of people in the industry will be getting over it fairly shortly too and then what happens is all these kids that thought they were all stoked for getting this stuff for free are gonna get nothing well nothing of super crazy good quality theres a handful of people that have been making snowboard movies for a super long time and theyre skilled craftsmen at what they do and when those guys start to go away then the kids are gonna see that theres a big difference between that type of production and just some kid with a camera
7422697 i think that the economy is really gonna hurt a lot of the manufacturers to the point where they cant afford to sponsor movies and then i think that the independent film companies are gonna have a really hard time
7422698 theres something like 300 plus videos that are being distributed this year all that does is burn everyone out on snowboard videos how can you get stoked if there are 300 of the same kind of film
7422699 moving forward it remains to be seen well see how were feeling well keep our feet in the snowboarding thing and maybe were going to come back at some point were just basically taking a break and its a good time for a break
7422700 with these changes our terrain will have the perfect balance of new challenges and old favorites for our expert and beginner visitors
7422701 the updates will complement and complete our mountain but will not change the intimate friendly atmosphere of the resort
7422702 since 1994 the nippon open has had a tremendous influence on the competitive snowboard scene in japan bringing a world class competition to japanese professional and amateur riders while attracting top international snowboarders to the region
7422703 with competitive snowboarding gaining momentum in china and korea we felt it was time to expand the nippon open into the asian open snowboarding championships attracting more riders from growing snowboarding communities throughout asia
7422704 to deliver underlying npat growth of 18 5 is a very pleasing result in any climate let alone in the prevailing economic conditions
7422705 this again demonstrates the resilience of our business model and the heightened global demand for the groups brands
7422706 we continue to build and shape this business to achieve solid growth into the future and this latest result again demonstrates our groups capacity to execute on this strategy
7422707 while there is understandable caution among retailers the world over we remain confident that our multi brand multi region business model will deliver healthy growth and our forward orders support this view
7422708 that said short term forecasting is getting more difficult given major fluctuations in currencies and volatile economic conditions however based on existing market conditions and assuming current exchange rates in particular an aud usd exchange rate of approximately us88 cents and an aud euro exchange rate of approximately 59 cents the group expects to deliver full year eps growth in the range of 8 to 12 in the 2008 09 financial year
7422709 dakine is well established within the boardsports sector and it is a brand that has built its reputation on the quality and reliability of its technical range
7422710 it has built a strong sales base in north america and a growing sales base in several international territories making it a powerful addition to the group
7422711 dakine is a brand that leads the boardsports backpack category excels in the surf accessories market in the ultimate testing ground of hawaii and has excellent penetration in winter product categories including snow gloves
7422712 it is a brand that is focused on function over fashion and this together with a strong team of athletes and compelling marketing campaigns has endeared it to active boardsports participants
7422713 billabong and dakine have both determined that each of us has complementary skills and strengths and together we have a compelling authentic offer
7422714 dakine left the surf world and is now a company that sells the surfing image
7422715 at 369 the heavenly pass is a phenomenal deal for lake tahoes top resort

7422717 triumph united represents exactly what we look for in a partner strength of distribution with a core knowledge that can only be earned by working with the sports best athletes day in and day out were looking forward to a partnership that pushes both brands to the forefront of the mma market triumph united is uniquely positioned to make that happen
7422718 action sports and mma share a symbiotic bond that triumph united would like to build and represent osiris shoes will make this union work we are very excited to be working with such a great company
7422719 osiris working with triumph united is a monumental opportunity for both companies as one of the preeminent mma brands triumph uniteds facilitation with our program can only result in a tremendous success

7422721 triumph united announces they will show osiris how to sell these damn things
7422722 osiris announces hey triumph united you wanted us to make this crap you sell it

7422724 within the carbon climate debate we have entered a transition period for these world class coal deposits where there is demand for cleaner diesels and other by products able to be generated through new age coal to liquids technologies
7422725 the latrobes future considering australias increasing reliance on fuel imports and pressures on the use of coal for power generation can slow this global fuel reliance by using coal to liquids technology to produce sulphur free diesels aviation fuel fertilisers and feedstock for other cleaner petroleum products
7422726 monashs intention is to evolve a clean coal project in the latrobe capable of producing 70 000 barrels a day of mainly ultra clean zero sulphur synthetic diesel
7422727 to achieve that volume will require however the mining and gasification of 30 million tonnes of coal a year but that will require a carbon capture and storage capability ccs of 15 million tonnes a year
7422728 that is equivalent to one years operation at the loy yang open cut coal mine or just over half the annual production capacity of the geelong refinery
7422729 however this ccs opportunity could be enhanced if there is a collective approach to using the gippsland basin as a central hub for sequestration a carbon sink for greenhouses gases there are enormous cost savings from co operation that make ccs competitive
7422730 so effectively we convert latrobes brown coal deposits into two new energy streams of clean fuel and gas storage
7422731 only at that point does this emerging sector have the opportunity to address the challenges of coordinating clean coal energy investment risk and regulatory certainty
7422732 and this goes for other usage of energy for an aircraft during takeoff the figure is only eight per cent while there is only 35 per cent of burnt coal in a power plant that becomes electricity the rest again is lost as heat
7422733 that is entirely feasible provided that they apply new technology and we apply discipline in the use of energy if people experience a true value of energy then they will be more amenable to reducing energy
7422734 we will also work with governments and advocate the need for more effective co2 regulations
7422735 it would be cheaper to operate if the stations were located near a gas pipeline if there is no pipeline it has to be supplied using trucks which is costly and a bit of a hassle
7422736 biofuel is another interesting option it can depending on which crop conversion process is used offer lower co2 emission we are one of the worlds leading distributors of first generation biofuel
7422737 in fact this year we have quadrupled our investment in biofuel

7422740 squirrels have attacked the english muffin i have collected the crumbs and ducktaped them and am wearing that around my neck is the bet still on
7422741 at elk lake resort a chipmunk ripped into the pouch holding the half of an english muffin and carried most of it away i collected what crumbs i could and resealed the pouch using duct tape i have continued hiking with the remaining crumbs pouch around my neck as before please advise on whether this disqualifies me from the 100 prize for wearing this thing to canada in eugene right now back at santiam pass tomorrow hope your hike is going well mine sure is

7422744 the report found that companies throughout northern ireland are feeling the effects of a shrinking talent pool by simply not retaining enough graduates many of which are being lured into foreign markets
7422745 good people are key and this has proved to be the biggest challenge for technology companies that rely on their employees to drive innovation and growth
7422746 developing skills in the workforce assigning relevant tasks and helping interaction with others are three key principles to retaining employees
7422747 traditionally taking part in the fast 50 also makes a big statement about a companys future direction and puts down a marker on where the company is going

7422750 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7422751 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counsellor on international crises that might come up

7422790 they just took me into their home literally not figuratively
7422791 i agreed to go to the senate for six months so we could find a replacement they changed my life gaylord and carrie lee quite frankly helped me stay in the senate
7422792 tragedy tests us it tests our fortitude and it tests our faith

7422819 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7422820 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7422821 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7422822 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused

7422841 second india must agree to halt production of nuclear material for weapons

7422867 american intelligence agencies have concluded that members of pakistans powerful spy service helped plan the deadly july 7 bombing of indias embassy in kabul afghanistan according to united states government officials
7422868 the conclusion was based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack the officials said providing the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region the american officials also said there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas

7422870 the pentagon says no civilians were killed in an air strike sunday in a remote area of eastern afghanistan which local officials say killed 27 people who were walking to a wedding
7422871 i can only tell you i talked to afghanistan this morning and they are very clear with that particular strike that they believe they struck the intended target and that there were not innocent civilians involved in that particular strike
7422872 the attack left bullet holes in two of the convoy vehicles and a weapon was found in the car
7422873 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
7422874 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7422875 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7422876 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role

7422907 but youre human powered search and they are machine search if you reach scale some users will choose right if human powered search is that much better like you say folks will switch right
7422908 ive never really considered that they really are our partner and thats how we treat them

7422919 they seemed never before to have weighed much against the abundance of her husbands kindness and a uniform devotion which had come to be tacit and self understood

7422921 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to leaven which a woman took and hid in three pecks of meal until it was all leavened
7422922 the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field whats the significance of it being the smallest seed
7422923 the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field 32 and this is smaller than all other seeds but when it is full grown it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches
7422924 and others fell upon the rocky places where they did not have much soil and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of soil 6
7422925 but when the sun had risen they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away 7
7422926 and others fell among the thorns and the thorns came up and choked them out 8
7422927 and others fell on the good soil and yielded a crop some a hundredfold some sixty and some thirty 9
7422928 to you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been granted 12
7422929 for whoever has to him shall more be given and he shall have an abundance but whoever does not have even what he has shall be taken away from him 13
7422930 therefore i speak to them in parables because while seeing they do not see and while hearing they do not hear nor do they understand 14
7422931 and in their case the prophecy of isaiah is being fulfilled which says you will keep on hearing but will not understand and you will keep on seeing but will not perceive 15
7422932 but blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear 17
7422933 for truly i say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see and did not see it
7422934 when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart this is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road 20
7422935 and the one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy 21
7422936 and the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns this is the man who hears the word and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it becomes unfruitful 23
7422937 and the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil this is the man who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and brings forth some a hundredfold some sixty and some thirty
7422938 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field 25
7422939 but while men were sleeping his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat and went away 26
7422940 but when the wheat sprang up and bore grain then the tares became evident also 27
7422941 and the slaves of the landowner came and said to him sir did you not sow good seed in your field how then does it have tares 28
7422942 and he said to them an enemy has done this and the slaves said to him do you want us then to go and gather them up 29
7422943 but he said no lest while you are gathering up the tares you may root up the wheat with them 30
7422944 first gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up but gather the wheat into my barn
7422945 the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field 32 and this is smaller than all other seeds but when it is full grown it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches
7422946 the kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three pecks of meal until it was all leavened
7422947 i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world
7422948 explain to us the parable of the tares of the field
7422949 the one who sows the good seed is the son of man 38
7422950 therefore just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire so shall it be at the end of the age 41
7422951 the son of man will send forth his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all stumbling blocks and those who commit lawlessness 42
7422952 then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father he who has ears let him hear 44
7422953 the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field 45
7422954 again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls 46
7422955 again the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea and gathering fish of every kind 48
7422956 so it will be at the end of the age the angels shall come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous 50
7422957 therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old
7422958 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field
7422959 first gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up but gather the wheat into my barn
7422960 the kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three pecks of meal until it was all leavened
7422961 again the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea and gathering fish of every kind and when it was filled they drew it up on the beach and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers but the bad they threw away and as he sowed some seeds fell beside the road and the birds came and ate them up and others fell upon the rocky places where they did not have much soil and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of soil but when the sun had risen they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and others fell among the thorns and the thorns came up and choked them out and others fell on the good soil and yielded a crop some a hundredfold some sixty and some thirty he who has ears let him hear
7422962 when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart this is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road and the one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy yet he has no firm root in himself but is only temporary and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word immediately he falls away and the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns this is the man who hears the word and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it becomes unfruitful and the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil this is the man who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and brings forth some a hundredfold some sixty and some thirty
7422963 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field
7422964 first gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up but gather the wheat into my barn
7422965 the one who sows the good seed is the son of man and the field is the world and as for the good seed these are the sons of the kingdom and the tares are the sons of the evil one and the enemy who sowed them is the devil and the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels
7422966 again the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea and gathering fish of every kind and when it was filled they drew it up on the beach and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers but the bad they threw away
7422967 as the lord lives surely the man who has done this deserves to die he must make restitution for the for the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and had no compassion

7423084 ada sesetengah pihak yang tersalah sangka dengan menganggap bahawa cadangan saya untuk dsai dan saiful bermubahalah itu satu perangkap untuk menjatuhkan dsai demi sesungguhnya tidak sebenarnya sejak beberapa bulan yang akhir ini wujudnya persahabatan bukan politik antara saya dan dsai sikapnya yang lebih lunak dan sering bertanya khabar agak menyenangkan apabila timbul isu liwat yang dibangkitkan oleh saiful maka saya bertanya hal tersebut kepada dsai sendiri daripada penjelasannya beliau memaklumkan bahawa wujudnya konspirasi katanya mahkamah dan polis akan dipergunakan saya yang bersimpati jika benar wujud konspirasi tersebut melihat imej beliau perlu dibersihkan dan perancangan buruk perlu dihentikan melalui satu proses yang menakutkan sesiapa yang khianat dan berdusta berdasarkan dakwaan dsai mahkamah dan polis tidak dipercayai maka saya mencadangkan proses yang terkandung dalam al quran dan al sunnah yang diluar dari hukuman manusia sebaliknya menanti balasan allah di dunia lagi iaitu mubahalah harapan saya supaya mereka yang jahat akan takut seperti mana golongan kristian najran yang takut dengan laknat allah s w t dan tidak berani bermubahalah dengan nabi muhammad s a w saya maklumkan secara perbualan telefon kepada dsai bahawa niat saya membersihkan imej beliau dan beliau ketika itu tidak pertikaikan tujuan saya walaupun kelihatan beliau keberatan tiba tiba selepas cadangan dibuat dan seperti pandangan pandangan saya yang lain ia mendapat liputan yang meluas saiful pula yang tampil mencabar dsai untuk bermubahalah dan telah melaknat dirinya jika dia bohong sementara dsai enggan menyahutnya atas alasan alasan beliau maka tiada sebarang konspirasi dalam cadangan ini sebaliknya tujuan asalnya adalah untuk kebaikan beliau jika beliau enggan maka para pengikutnya yang tidak perlu mempertikaikan pencadangnya

7423088 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7423089 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7423090 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7423091 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7423092 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7423093 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7423094 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7423095 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7423096 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7423097 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7423098 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7423099 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7423100 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7423101 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7423102 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7423103 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country
7423104 saya pilih calon yang paling ringan mudarat kepada masyarakat saya sarankan agar para pengundi islam menunaikan solat istiqarah sebagai panduan untuk memilih calon yang sesuai
7423105 ini kerana landskap politik negara semakin mengelirukan dan mengaburi banyak pihak sehingga persaingan tertumpu kepada keburukan akhlak pemimpin kedua dua belah pihak
7423106 masyarakat gelisah melihat corak dan politik sekarang kerana ianya lebih kepada budaya londeh melondeh keburukan sehingga ianya tidak menunjukkan kematangan berfikir dan kebebasan untuk melahirkan pandangan yang berbeza
7423107 sepatunya kita mesti raikan perbezaan pendapat dan menghargai kebebasan pemikiran dan budi bahasa pemimpin yang baik daripada memburukkan akhlaknya
7423108 jika saya beralih pandangan dalam sesuatu isu ada yang tuduh saya pengampu kerajaan atau menyokong pembangkang sedangkan niat saya untuk memperbetulkan keadaan demi islam dan rakyat ini tandanya politik pemikiran yang bankrap yang harus dimerdekakan

7423128 the economy is tanking so you gotta cut corners where you can

7423132 my main concern since ive been in politics is the underrepresentation of the mexican americans

7423135 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7423136 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7423137 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7423138 if youre hungry and he has food why dont you eat
7423139 2 01 in a scandalous red i lay there inert he still on top trying to bring something to life that probably wasnt going to wake in a while that did not apply to me
7423140 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7423141 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7423142 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7423143 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7423144 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7423145 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7423146 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7423147 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7423148 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7423149 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7423150 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7423151 recentemente gli archeologi cinesi hanno dato notizia della presenza nel gansu di un centinaio di contadini del luogo le cui caratteristiche fisiche denoterebbero la loro probabile origine europea sulla base delle ricerche condotte dagli esperti essi sarebbero i discendenti di un residuo delle truppe di un corpo di spedizione dellantica roma
7423152 i miei genitori mi dicevano spesso che i nostri antenati provenivano da un lontano paese delloccidente mio padre aveva occhi azzurri e capelli chiari ed assomigliava in tutto a quegli europei che in seguito ho avuto occasione di vedere sui giornali
7423153 if this aint the worst voyage ive ever been on the deck is slick with ice when im on lookout the wind cuts through me jacket like a knife every time i reef the foresail i blamed near freeze me fingers and all i get for it is a miserable five shillings a month
7423154 i cant sleep at night for the cold ladies on this ship dont get as many blankets as the men it isnt fair
7423155 chingado im only getting half the wages of the anglo seamen we need plenty of food to keep us warm in this climate and im not getting my share the anglos get more and the worst of it is that the mates always give me orders in english instead of spanish
7423156 if the palefaces hadnt robbed me of my ancestral lands i wouldnt even be on this ship here among the icebergs and arctic winds i would just be paddling a canoe on a nice placid lake i deserve compensation at the very least the captain should let me run a crap game so that i can make some money
7423157 yesterday the first mate called me a fruit just because i suck cocks i have a right to suck cocks without being called names for it
7423158 why last week i saw the second mate kick the ships dog twice
7423159 all this is just awful its immoral its racism sexism speciesism homophobia and exploitation of the working class its discrimination we must have social justice equal wages for the mexican sailor higher wages for all sailors compensation for the indian equal blankets for the ladies a guaranteed right to suck cocks and no more kicking the dog
7423160 ahem you all have good reasons to complain but it seems to me that what we really have to do is get this ship turned around and headed back south because if we keep going north were sure to be wrecked sooner or later and then your wages your blankets and your right to suck cocks wont do you any good because well all drown
7423161 we officers have to admit that some really inexcusable things have been happening on this ship we hadnt realized how bad the situation was until we heard your complaints we are men of good will and want to do right by you but well the captain is rather conservative and set in his ways and may have to be prodded a bit before hell make any substantial changes my personal opinion is that if you protest vigorously but always peacefully and without violating any of the ships rules you would shake the captain out of his inertia and force him to address the problems of which you so justly complain
7423162 six shillings a month is a pittance and i still freeze me fingers when i reef the foresail
7423163 im still not getting the same wages as the anglos or enough food for this climate
7423164 we women still dont have enough blankets to keep us warm
7423165 its really terrible that the dog gets kicked for stealing a bit of bread from the galley and that women dont have equal blankets and that the able seaman gets his fingers frozen and i dont see why the bosun shouldnt suck cocks if he wants to but look how thick the icebergs are now and how the wind blows harder and harder weve got to turn this ship back toward the south because if we keep going north well be wrecked and drowned
7423166 its just so awful that we keep heading north but why should i have to keep cocksucking in the closet why should i be called a fruit aint i as good as everyone else
7423167 but dont you see thats exactly why women need more blankets to keep them warm i demand equal blankets for women now
7423168 that sailing to the north imposes great hardships on all of us but changing course toward the south would be unrealistic you cant turn back the clock we must find a mature way of dealing with the situation
7423169 if we let those four madmen up on the poop deck have their way well all be drowned if we ever get the ship out of danger then we can worry about working conditions blankets for women and the right to suck cocks but first weve got to get this vessel turned around if a few of us get together make a plan and show some courage we can save ourselves it wouldnt take many of us six or eight would do we could charge the poop chuck those lunatics overboard and turn the ship to the south
7423170 i think the captain needs to be prodded again it would help if you all would put on another protest as long as it remains nonviolent
7423171 dont you see what the captain and the mates are doing theyre keeping you occupied with your trivial grievances about blankets and wages and the dog being kicked so that you wont think about what is really wrong with this ship that its getting farther and farther to the north and were all going to be drowned if just a few of you would come to your senses get together and charge the poop deck we could turn this ship around and save ourselves but all you do is whine about petty little issues like working conditions and crap games and the right to suck cocks
7423172 do you think its reasonable that i get only three fourths the wages of an anglo sailor is that petty
7423173 dont you know how humiliating it is to be called a fruit
7423174 these issues are not petty and trivial kicking the dog is cruel and brutal and it is humiliating to be called a fruit but in comparison to our real problem in comparison to the fact that the ship is still heading north your grievances are petty and trivial because if we dont get this ship turned around soon were all going to drown
7423175 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7423176 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7423177 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7423178 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7423179 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7423180 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7423181 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7423182 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7423183 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7423184 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7423185 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7423186 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7423187 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7423188 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7423189 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7423190 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country
7423191 o cr dito farto fez que o boom se espalhasse
7423192 a principal quest o que n o se calcula a capacidade de suporte das cidades
7423193 o brasil passa por um per odo de euforia no mercado imobili rio h muito tempo n o se via um cr dito t o farto para a compra de im veis e nem tanta oferta
7423194 fundamental contar com outras fontes de renda uma vez que o im vel para revenda traz o risco da baixa liquidez e o im vel para aluguel traz o risco da vac ncia ou da inadimpl ncia
7423195 trabalho h 25 anos com venda de im veis e um mercado mais conservador a bolsa de valores est na moda mas tem altos e baixos para o primeiro investimento bom pesquisar e tomar emprestada a menor quantidade poss vel de financiamento
7423196 os im veis ainda n o come aram a valoriza o do ativo mas isso deve acontecer com o crescimento da economia de um ponto de vista geral quem tiver um bom im vel vai querer um melhor
7423197 o ideal comprar im vel para o p blico da classe m dia quem adquire casa ou apartamento muito barato provavelmente n o ter garantias com aluguel pois o inquilino para este tipo de im vel n o costuma ter fiador nem paga tr s meses adiantados como dep sito
7423198 um apartamento muito caro tamb m pode n o ser o mais indicado j que impostos condom nio e a administra o s o altos
7423199 eles t m maior liquidez ou seja a revenda com lucro costuma ser mais r pida im veis de alto padr o costumam exigir mais paci ncia do investidor para realizar seus lucros atualmente diante da nova lei que limita a destina o de grandes reas para condom nios im veis em grandes empreendimentos e com aprova o obtida antes da entrada em vigor da lei tender o a se valorizar mais
7423200 creio que a nossa economia passa por um per odo incr vel e que muitos brasileiros enriquecer o com isso o enriquecimento da sociedade afeta diretamente a valoriza o dos im veis por isso acredito que quem come ar a comprar im veis como investimento ter pouco do que se arrepender daqui a alguns anos desde que se fa am escolhas criteriosas no momento da compra
7423201 em um mercado que cresce intensamente esta op o um bom investimento desde que a escolha da construtora seja criteriosa
7423202 esse tipo de investimento lucrativo prevemos em torno de 10 a 12 de rentabilidade do capital atualizado em pr dios novos o retorno muito maior pois ele tende a valorizar nos dez primeiros anos o propriet rio poder ainda contar com o valor do aluguel
7423203 pesquise quanto mais visitas a im veis mais se tem no o de pre o quando voc tiver essa percep o ter condi es de avaliar valores e fazer o investimento que julgue o correto
7423204 o crescimento n o ser l quido e certo como durante as d cadas de urbaniza o do brasil teremos reas que valorizar o muito e outras que entrar o em decad ncia o investidor seletivo o que ganhar mais
7423205 comecei a investir em im veis porque cheguei conclus o depois de conversar com muitas pessoas de que im vel um investimento onde dificilmente perde se dinheiro na m dia ele rende um pouco mais que um investimento conservador e d solidez para a carteira de investimentos outro ponto importante que o brasileiro gosta de comprar im vel o que d certa liquidez a esse mercado
7423206 im veis em bairros densamente povoados com v rios servi os dispon veis e pouco espa o para novas constru es pr ximas custam caro e tendem a valorizar menos do que outras alternativas com maior potencial de amadurecimento
7423207 loteamentos em munic pios menores ou nos arredores de grandes cidades nem sempre s o boas oportunidades de investimento caso a urbaniza o ou o desenvolvimento demorarem a chegar por l voc ver seu investimento render muito menos do que se estivesse na segura e rent vel renda fixa oferecida atrav s de bancos e corretora na hora de comprar alguns fatores s o decisivos para a boa valoriza o de seu im vel novos servi os e melhorias para o bairro novos empreendimentos satura o de regi es vizinhas e hist rico da construtora e do arquiteto fazem diferen a lucre investindo em pesquisa de mais informa es evite comprar por impulso
7423208 she said presenting me with the marriage license that i needed to fill out to make sure that all of this was legally binding and you know actually existing in the eyes of the state
7423209 whaa what happened did they change the laws or something
7423210 nope but it helps if you fill it out correctly nimrod
7423211 she snarked and i knew that she found it just as funny as i did when she handed me the garbled beyond recognition parchment i boozily emoted over just 48 hours prior
7423212 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7423213 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7423214 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead
7423215 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7423216 there seems to be a sense of urgency we have had a couple of weeks that were not so good
7423217 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers this is a big opportunity for him
7423218 i have a lot of doubts that this convention is going to be as persuasive as it should be because theyve got this damn thing with hillary
7423219 i love hillary i was for her but this is the worst political decision i could imagine this is supposed to be an obama celebration youre going to get the nomination of someone who came very close to winning and youre going to get a lot of people in there cheering and hollering and some people booing
7423220 there has got to be a full reconciliation between the clinton people and the obama people i think the convention will put to rest any past divisions among supporters
7423221 i cant wait to hear hillary clinton talk about the future and am excited that her candidacy is unifying our party
7423222 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7423223 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7423224 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7423225 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7423226 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7423227 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7423228 i didnt know what it was when i saw it

7423238 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7423239 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7423240 to effect the purposes and intent of the uigea it is the sense of the congress that the attorney general should focus any prosecutorial efforts on those persons who a offer internet sports betting in the united states or b process payments for illegal internet sports betting in the united states
7423241 in light of the foregoing and in deference to long standing constitutional requirements of fair notice and transparency in the criminal law the congress finds it necessary to clarify that criminal statutes applicable to gambling do not apply to any person who offered internet gambling services that did not include sports betting prior to october 13 2006 and who ceased offering internet gambling services to persons in the united states upon passage of the uigea
7423242 no provision of this act or any amendment made by this act shall be construed as clarifying or implying that internet bets or wagers other than sports bets or wagers which were accepted subsequent to october 13 2006 are in violation of federal law
7423243 to date all federal internet gambling prosecutions have involved sports betting creating a lack of authoritative court decisions on the applicability of other federal criminal statutes to internet poker and casino style gambling
7423244 the ppa remains concerned with the implication hr 6663 asserts in that the uigea has made internet poker an unlawful activity that needs special protection from prosecution
7423245 only to internet sports wagering and not to internet poker thus hr 6663 only confuses a clear judicial standing on this matter
7423246 are you trying to be glamorous all of a sudden
7423247 you wear black almost all the time and you never do anything with your hair and youre pale

7423253 on thursday col william costello spokesman for the u s southern command said the command made 3 600 intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance flights followed up on 175 intelligence leads and spent 250 million trying
7423254 spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record and the bush administration was adamant about giving the colombians the credit
7423255 the u s special operations command helped with surveillance that positively located the hostages within the past year using satellites aircraft and ground reconnaissance and had tracked them since then
7423256 extraordinary commando operations that resemble the coup that occurred today
7423257 order military operations that could kill her and then justify the war saying that the guerrillas killed her
7423258 in recent weeks intelligence operatives have arrested 14 squirrels within irans borders the squirrels were carrying spy gear of foreign agencies and were stopped before they could act thanks to the alertness of our intelligence services
7423259 yeah momma is freaking out huh momma needs to chill out

7423264 to presume kennedy is coming and make preparations on the basis of him coming
7423265 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7423266 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7423267 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7423268 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7423269 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7423270 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7423271 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7423272 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7423273 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7423274 diantara tanda tanda keangungan allah ialah dia ciptakan bagimu dari jenis jenismu sendiri pasangan pasangannya supaya kamu hidup tentram bersamanya dan allah jadikan bagimu cinta dan kasih sayang sesungguhnya dalam hal itu ada tanda tanda bagi orang orang yang mau berfikir

7423277 isteri yang terbaik adalah isteri yang membahagiakanmu saat kamu memandangnya yang mematuhimu kalau kamu menyuruhnya dan memelihara kehormatan dirinya san hartamu bila kamu tidak ada disisinya
7423278 wahai wanita ingatlah ayat ayat allah dan hikmah yang dibacakan di rumah rumah kamu sesungguhnya allah maha penyayang dan maha mengetahui
7423279 seandainya aku boleh memerintahkan kepada manusia bersujud kepada manusia lain aku akan perintahkan para isteri untuk bersujud kepada suami mereka karena besarnya hak suami yang dianugerahkan allah atas mereka
7423280 bila di dunia ini ada surga surga itu adalah pernikahan yang bahagia tetapi bila di dunia ini ada neraka neraka adalah pernikahan yang gagal

7423288 bila seorang wanita meninggal dunia dan suaminya ridho sekali dengan tingkah lakunya semasa hidupnya maka wanita itu masuk surga

7423291 saya hampir tidak pernah menikmati kecantikan istri saya yang sebenarnya dia miliki
7423292 tunaikanlah hak istrimu yaitu didiklah ia dengan ajaran agama agar mengetahui apa yang menjadi hak dan kewajibannya bersabar dan banyaklah berdoa pada allah
7423293 suami itu tersentak sadar bahwa meskipun perjalan rumah tangganya dengan sang istri telah membuahkan lima anak dia sama sekali belum menunaikan hak istri yang satu ini
7423294 apabila diperintah ia taat apabila dipandang menyenangkan hati suaminya dan apabila suaminya tidak ada dirumah ia menjaga diri dan harta suaminya
7423295 dunia adalah perhiasan kesenangan dan sebaik baik perhiasan kesenangan dunia adalah wanita istri shalihah
7423296 siapa diantara manusia yang paling besar haknya atas seorang istri
7423297 bila seorang wanita telah mengerjakan shalat lima waktu dan berpuasa pada bulan ramadhan dan memelihara kemaluannya serta taat kepada suaminya maka kelak dikatakan kepadanya
7423298 andaikan saja dibolehkan seseorang bersujud kepada orang lain niscaya aku perintahkan istri untuk sujud kepada suaminya
7423299 maka wanita yang shalihah ialah yang taat kepada allah lagi memelihara diri ketika suaminya tidak ada oleh karena itu allah telah memelihara mereka
7423300 menyenangkan bila dipandang itu artinya indahnya penampilan secara dzahir serta akhlaq yang mulia juga terus menerus menyibukkan diri dalam taat dan bertaqwa kepada allah
7423301 mengapa tidak menikah dengan seorang gadis yang bisa engkau cumbu dan bisa mencumbuimu
7423302 wahai rasulullah saya memiliki saudara saudara perempuan yang berjiwa keras saya tidak mau membawa yang keras juga kepada mereka janda ini saya harapkan mampu menyelesaikan permasalahan tersebut

7423310 the post czarist soviet union and margaret thatchers with the insanity of russian bolshevism a bit of a stretch but the references are revealing
7423311 we must note with bitterness the threat of a progressive deterioration in the climate of confidence and cooperation that should characterize relations between nations
7423312 with which humanity strives to form that common awareness of being the family of nations that john paul ii indicated as the ideal to the general assembly of the united nations
7423313 we must deepen the awareness of being united by a common destiny that in the final analysis is a transcendent destiny to avert the return to nationalistic conflicts that in other historical periods have had such tragic consequences
7423314 the recent events have weakened the confidence in many that such experiences had been consigned to the past
7423315 we must instead actively commit ourselves to reject the temptation to confront new situations with old systems
7423316 routes to take with tenacity and creativity to build fruitful and sincere relations and to guarantee to present and future generations times of concord and moral and civil progress

7423362 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
7423363 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself

7423389 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves

7423402 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
7423403 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
7423404 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
7423405 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all

7423449 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents a disaster who planned that brazille having bill clinton sell democrats would have been a wonderful thing having him give a sober speech about how obama can be commander in chief what a waste of talent too bad they threw wes clark under the bus he would have been the right person to make this case but obama does not want him talking about democratic achievements of the past hell fdr would assigned to talking about the environment or something team

7423454 he has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration
7423455 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7423456 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7423457 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7423458 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7423459 they wont sit out the election because of the supreme court
7423460 that doesnt prevent me from trying to keep focused on the desired end result

7423504 government officials who traveled to the village of azizabad in herat province on saturday said the death toll had risen to 95 from 76 making it one of the deadliest airstrikes on civilians in nearly seven years of war
7423505 the american military said saturday it was investigating the attack
7423506 the karzai government has expressed outrage over recent airstrikes that have led to civilian deaths as popular support for the coalition presence in afghanistan dwindles the tension comes at a delicate time for the american led coalition which is facing a resurgent taliban with a perceived shortage of troops leading it to rely more on air power to battle militants
7423507 lt col rumi nielson green a spokeswoman for the u s military said 30

7423515 my editor asked if i had any suggestions and i mentioned the two things above when i first saw the cover i loved it i didnt make any change suggestions my only slight reservation was that they had intended to photograph the cover with the model holding real cherries to me it looks like they were photoshopped

7423519 some of the spirit of self negation self discipline sense of humour responsibility helpfulness to others loyalty and patriotism which go to make character
7423520 the reason we find the concept of character difficult is because of class conflict in british society
7423521 there was a sense that good character was handed down from a patrician class to the great unwashed
7423522 a refusal to make judgments about what is good and bad behaviour right and wrong
7423523 a young student ponders whether to spend the evening revising at her desk or to go out with friends better marks mean better prospects but dancing and drink are attractive too how much to sacrifice tonight for a remote future when to stop having fun but also when to stop being serious conventions expectations and institutions have built up gradually over decades and centuries to form a stock of equipment available to deal with her problem sources and strategies of self control both cognitive and social take time to develop
7423524 over time poverty has become more associated with differences in character development
7423525 so while in the past a poor deprived child would have about the same chance of developing a good character as a more affluent one our research suggests that children who were born into deprivation in the 1970s as opposed to the late 1950s were much less likely to develop good character than more affluent groups
7423526 theres an interaction between your genetic predisposition and the way you turn out according to the way youre raised
7423527 when it comes to being antisocial aggressive stealing and lying the interaction is a big one if you have poor self control and a rather twitchy irritable temperament and youre brought up in a harsh way its bad news for that group the rate of criminality aged 17 is about 40 per cent but if you have that twitchy character and youre brought up in a reasonably calm soothing way your parents dont overreact they let you run around in the park after school you will do well
7423528 financial poverty is a factor but not a central one
7423529 i am fond of saying poverty of what and actually it seems to be poverty of the parent child experience that leads to poor child outcomes rather than poverty of a material kind
7423530 the danger is that many people in deprived areas are being denied work because of a lack of cultural capital
7423531 in glasgow 50 per cent of jobs are now filled by commuters from the middle class suburbs
7423532 one of the key things about a family that works well is the in built hierarchy
7423533 the ideal sort of family for character development is two adult parents and older siblings who are well behaved then there are opportunities for purposeful activities a family holiday with joint activities or regularly playing football in the park family mealtimes and having meaningful conversations with parents are particularly important
7423534 it is regular time with the same adult over an extended period so that you respect them and learn from them
7423535 which is why things like the scout movement are so effective because youre progressing youre ageing through the institution and there tends to be a very good staying on rate for the adult workers so you have a lot of interaction with the same adult over a long period of time

7423642 that we collectively have to do a better job with and each individual needs to do a better job
7423643 i was concerned because we put a lot more in
7423644 we were playing a defense that wasnt as vanilla as washington
7423645 as disappointing as it was that those plays were called back we see from the end result how good it can be
7423646 it is a point of emphasis by the officials just trying to make sure were getting up on the line as far as our receivers and as far as the offensive line anytime its a point of emphasis like that in a game you have to stay on top of those things you have to adjust as an offense and we didnt adjust fast enough
7423647 ill present my side ill say that id love to play one series two series mangini may say that its not worth it and so be it
7423648 i just want to see how practice goes we have a short week the penalty issue is going to be a real focus of mine over the next couple of days that is something completely in our control at all times it influences drives it influences everything

7423659 i guess shutting it down is an option but he asked me what i want to do and i want to pitch
7423660 we want to do whats best for john maine and also whats for the team
7423661 i guess shutting it down is an option but he asked me what i want to do and i want to pitch
7423662 i said to myself get in the fairway get on the green and give yourself a chance because putting is what i do best
7423663 i knew if i hit it good enough with the way i putt i knew id have a chance
7423664 that putt was a lot more difficult than the one i had in regulation
7423665 it broke a couple feet its a pretty amazing putt to make in a playoff
7423666 i said to myself get in the fairway get on the green and give yourself a chance because putting is what i do best
7423667 i knew if i hit it good enough with the way i putt i knew id have a chance
7423668 that putt was a lot more difficult than the one i had in regulation

7423670 a lot of media a lot of plastic toys go buy something just so that he would stop crying
7423671 you can make a lot of beautiful things with what nature gives us
7423672 that way kids have connection with nature animals and the creative people who make the toys so its not just consumption
7423673 its just a refreshing option for people who in a way not knowingly want something different
7423674 if they know how much time goes in one toy they will respect it and value it
7423675 i feel that if i take it away and say its bad it ruins the whole concept of play
7423676 it becomes not separate from reality and it becomes more real to them it has moral inflection to it and comes the concept of war and politics and its not all about that
7423677 a lot of media a lot of plastic toys go buy something just so that he would stop crying

7423684 a couple of ducks came then a couple more then a couple more
7423685 next thing you know they tell every duck in bergen county hey come over here
7423686 the only thing that was keeping her going were the ducks
7423687 we put a quarter million dollars in the house for renovation and now we have duck doo on it
7423688 i know it sounds like i was defiant but it meant a lot to me and my wife
7423689 the ducks were a manifestation of frank and dianes love for each other
7423690 frank had to keep the ducks fed because he was really feeding his relationship with his wife no matter what he was going to do that
7423691 emotionally i wouldnt do it it was a bad time of the year
7423692 what am i supposed to do come in here with dirt and machines and kill her
7423693 the reason he was so belligerent as i understand it is that it gave his wife pleasure
7423694 a couple of ducks came then a couple more then a couple more
7423695 next thing you know they tell every duck in bergen county hey come over here
7423696 the only thing that was keeping her going were the ducks
7423697 we put a quarter million dollars in the house for renovation and now we have duck doo on it
7423698 i know it sounds like i was defiant but it meant a lot to me and my wife
7423699 announcement late last month designating venues in three city parks as protest zones during the olympics
7423700 it is a political response to a serious problem we have neglected for decades
7423701 some call you the elite i call you my base
7423702 the number one factor influencing pricing for components right now is raw materials and a lot of it is metal related
7423703 depending on the component it may be palladium silver copper gold nickel and tin all those costs are up year over year
7423704 the housing crisis is a direct result of 9 11 the fed lowered interest rates to prevent a recession and kept them low too long which created the housing bubble
7423705 the bubble burst but home prices are still above where they were five or even three years ago its not a disaster
7423706 it doesnt look like this was premeditated with a massive staging of equipment
7423707 until the night before the fighting russia seemed to be playing a constructive role
7423708 crackle and break heave and sigh as if they were noisily protesting their fate
7423709 our kids are going to be so angry with us one day
7423710 weve added so many greenhouse gases to the atmosphere for our generations growth that our kids are likely going to spend a good part of their adulthood maybe all of it just dealing with the climate implications of our profligacy
7423711 and now our leaders are telling them our kids the way out is
7423712 as for his claim that additional offshore drilling is madness how would he define current offshore drilling hysteria or mere folly
7423713 even your most hardcore environmentalist recognizes we cant go to zero carbon emissions immediately and that we cant end all drilling today
7423714 so one of the costs he relies on is the cost of enacting the green agenda of putting a price on carbon thats known as circular reasoning
7423715 increased droughts in some areas could also mean more rainfall in others it could balance out a warmer planet might even be wetter
7423716 why would violently unpredictable weather affect mortgage rates a ticked off bernanke wont cut interest rates after his yachts been capsized by a category 5 hurricane
7423717 if the earth was getting cooler would we have less violent and more predictable weather why is violent and unpredictable weather the result of a warmer planet oh yeah the models say so i forgot
7423718 i find it interesting that friedman has to go to the arctic circle a place few americans will ever visit to find evidence of climate change since the affects of the earths climate are ubiquitous and accessible to the layperson why the report from such a remote locale a problem our children will spend their whole lives consumed with can only be seen in ilulissat greenland
7423719 after all the climate always changes and most people know that
7423720 oh dont bring the flashlight well be back before night time
7423721 a large majority 73 of those who describe their households as professional or business class rate their finances positively
7423722 a majority of americans 53 now say their financial situation is only fair or poor up from 49 in january fully 58 of the public says that their incomes are falling behind the rising cost of living this compares with just 44 who expressed this view in september 2007
7423723 drivers of even the most heinous people are generally not charged with war crimes
7423724 at these trials hearsay and secret documents are admissable mr hamdans defense was actually required to begin its case in a secret session the witness was the camp psychologist presumably called to back mr hamdans account of being abused by his interrogators
7423725 he testified that he was informed by his superiors that only guilty verdicts would be tolerated
7423726 he also said that he was told to bring high profile cases quickly to help republicans score a pre election public relations coup
7423727 i concluded that full fair and open trials were not possible under the current system
7423728 a highly politicized system in which people who were supposed to be neutral decision makers were alllied with the prosecutors
7423729 had instructed prosecutors not to offer evidence obtained through the torture technique known as waterboarding
7423730 helped draft the orders permitting acts like waterboarding that violate american laws and the quaint my word geneva conventions
7423731 how is the commission system falling far short of the goals laid out by the times do the commissions have to have a 90 acquittal rate 100 what will make the times happy
7423732 a highly politicized system in which people who were supposed to be neutral decision makers were allied with the prosecutors
7423733 told to bring high profile cases quickly to help republicans score a pre election public relations coup
7423734 there must be weapons of mass destruction around here somewhere heh heh
7423735 to investors its very much a recession to workers its a recession
7423736 and really what matters in the end is whats taking place in payrolls and the unemployment rate and theyre both moving in the direction of a labor market recession how can you argue with that
7423737 that would have extended the investment tax credits for installing solar energy and the production tax credits for building wind turbines and other energy efficiency systems
7423738 sure well need wind and solar energy but its just not cost effective yet
7423739 friedman wonders how mccain can criticize congress when the senator himself had missed a vitally important vote on july 30th
7423740 according to friedman this is the eighth time in the last year that mccain has missed a vote on this bill
7423741 senators running for president dont vote for squat they dont have time they are not in washington
7423742 the july 30th vote for cloture fell short by nine votes six senators did not vote even if all six had voted for it it wasnt going to pass we have a word for your criticism moot
7423743 the vote was to extend a tax credit program that doesnt expire until the end of the year so nothing really has happened of consequence yet again your complaint is moot
7423744 the fact that congress has failed eight times to renew them is largely because of a hard core of republican senators who either dont want to give democrats such a victory in an election year or simply dont believe in renewable energy
7423745 the fact that the oil companies have been saying something thats effectively been true for 30 years is to friedman evidence that its a canard by the way the tax credits freidmans talking about have been in place for quite some time and they still havent made these technologies competitive with oil and coal
7423746 freidmans intelligence should be questioned if he thinks mccains missed vote on july 30th is important
7423747 theres an anger self righteousness and quiet panic to friedman and the rest of the environmental crusaders
7423748 the panic comes from the fear deep down that they know the public is never going to buy what they are selling if they ever had to fully spell out what they are aiming to do including the true costs involved theyd get laughed off the stage
7423749 for the purposes of my piece i think he could be classified as sort of an environmentalist
7423750 lobbies regulatory agencies on alcohol issues that involve public health and safety
7423751 obama has the most liberal voting record in the senate and has no significant accomplishments to speak of
7423752 the ratings system devised in 1981 under the direction of william schneider a political analyst and commentator and a contributing editor to national journal also assigns
7423753 oh so he wants to invade poland and put jews in concentration camps eh
7423754 he must be doing something right he has tons of listeners
7423755 i worry about my judgment whenever anything i believe in or do begins to be accepted by the american public
7423756 sir prove to me that you are not working with our enemies
7423757 would they let him continue his tv show if it was all based on lies
7423758 indicating that we only have freedom of speech in certain places
7423759 oh youre just a conspiracy theorist i dont have to listen to you
7423760 you know i think if you drive your car off of a cliff youll die
7423761 if you dont like this country the viet nam war the draft segregation etc you can move to russia
7423762 inflicting physical pain is not a necessary nor particularly effective method
7423763 sorry to see that you are so angry its always the typical left wing response
7423764 just because i own exxon stock doesnt exempt me from the fact that i would love energy independance
7423765 there are not many linear technologies out there that have the payback of petrobased fuels
7423766 have you every read a corporate report or are you waiting on the cliff notes from moveon org
7423767 you must be a marxism is it wrong to own stock also
7423768 i know you believe and i firmly believe that those tax cuts were part of that engine for that economic vitality and the economy is not doing as well as wed like to do like it to do today but theres no question that the tax cuts provided economic vitality
7423769 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on
7423770 weve got the best health care system in the world and we need to keep it that way we need to keep it that way by keeping the private market strong by resisting efforts that are happening in washington d c to say the federal government should be running health care
7423771 i think we have a problem on global warming i think there is a debate about whether its caused by mankind or whether its caused naturally but its a worthy debate its a debate actually that im in the process of solving
7423772 if you become a more productive citizen youll make more money better productivity better skills means higher pay
7423773 drill here drill now drill here drill now four legs good two legs bad
7423774 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
7423775 mr bush is the triumph of the seemingly average american man
7423776 hes not an intellectual intellectuals start all the trouble in the world
7423777 the argument that some influential commentators made publicly that the war was a good idea not because iraq posed a real threat but because beating up someone in the middle east never mind who would show muslims that we mean business
7423778 in case youre wondering the real reason the price of gas has been going down is the drop in demand you know supply and demand
7423779 so you see when suv drivers harumph about their right to drive gas guzzlers they cost you and me money
7423780 by your thinking you could say fox news is moderate because alan colmes is on the network come on that logic makes as much sense as krugmans piece
7423781 this line of thinking is dangerous when you start questioning peoples right to trade in a marketplace because it raises the price of a commodity youre going down the wrong road couples with children demand and consume more food than couples who dont raising the price of food and costing you and me money
7423782 lucille were not at the point where we should talk about limiting peoples rights to own certain kind of cars you dont happen to like
7423783 lucille increasing the supply of oil even if its 10 years down the road will affect prices today trust me wall street has computers that can process that additional info
7423784 1 increasing access to drilling increases the supply of oil which will affect the price
7423785 2 even if we decreases our use of oil china and indias growth will continue to increase worldwide demand driving up prices for everyone so increasing worldwide supply is helpful towards containgin price increases
7423786 3 since well still need oil 10 years from now buying as little as possible from foreign countries is probably a good thing
7423787 even though it may take some years the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that i think is beneficial
7423788 we should be able to deliver bottled hot water to dehydrated babies
7423789 well my understanding from the comments of various oil company executives is that if the restrictions are lifted they could mobilize their rigs fairly quickly and indeed be pumping oil in 2 to 5 years depending on the areas involved
7423790 o n my first day in office i would give the military a new mission ending this war
7423791 would rather lose a war to win a political campaign
7423792 eric if the government lied about wmds in iraq why didnt we just plant some there once we invaded
7423793 george w bush didnt invent the idea that iraq was a problem his two predecessors both went to war with iraq in 1998 amp 1991
7423794 in 1998 the u s congress passed the iraq liberation act stating it was official u s policy for regime change in iraq clinton signed it was clinton a neocon too was he part of the fabrication of this so called problem
7423795 where are the civil rights violations you keep speaking of
7423796 when japan attacked the u s in 1941 roosevelt put 100 000 citizens in concentration camps after the attacks of 9 11 bush tapped some phone calls to overseas locations and you want to have a fit
7423797 you dont know who attacked the united states on 9 11 and think all of the worlds problems is bushs fault that places you among a class of people who are in willful denial with whats going on in the world
7423798 continue to live in the fantasy world where bush is the problem not al qaeda or other elements of islamist fascism
7423799 im no longer responding to your posts someone who isnt sure if al qaeda even exists does not have much to offer in a serious debate about the worlds problems
7423800 john mccain says we should stay until were victorious show me one time hes come up with a definition of what he means by victory in iraq and then tell me how he plans to get there
7423801 saddam had used wmds in the past against iran and the kurds
7423802 after gulf war i we gave him a cease fire in exchange that he present his wmds to inspectors to be destroyed that process was never completed because saddam wanted his neighbors to think he still had them we know this because he told his interogators this while in our custody for 2 years
7423803 no one knowd when he got rid of his remaining stockpiles he could have driven tham to syria as we were entering iraq in 2003 but we found plenty of shells with remnants of mustard gas we found tons and tons of uranium we found centrifuges buried in scientists backyards
7423804 saddam was a permanent wmd menace it was unacceptable our containment policy was failing wed tried everything short of invasion after 12 years of sanctions inspectors no fly zones oil for food and the like we finally ended the stalemate i think it was the right decision at the time so did most of the congress hopefully a decent iraq will come out of it
7423805 bah your sources are weak therefore i can feel justified in ignoring everything therein
7423806 again you really need to let go of this idea that saddam was a wmd menace it has long been debunked
7423807 the 1991 persian gulf war and subsequent u n inspections destroyed iraqs illicit weapons capability and for the most part saddam hussein did not try to rebuild it according to an extensive report by the chief u s weapons inspector in iraq that contradicts nearly every prewar assertion made by top administration officials about iraq
7423808 duelfers report contradicted a number of specific claims administration officials made before the war
7423809 thats an example of a good link the author says where he got the data from he links to his source etc the idea that the u s was the prinicpal backer of saddam in the 80s is a myth
7423810 military action was now seen as inevitable bush wanted to remove saddam through military action justified by the conjunction of terrorism and wmd but the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy
7423811 the nsc had no patience with the un route and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the iraqi regimes record there was little discussion in washington of the aftermath after military action
7423812 it seemed clear that bush had made up his mind to take military action even if the timing was not yet decided but the case was thin saddam was not threatening his neighbours and his wmd capability was less than that of libya north korea or iran
7423813 we should work up a plan for an ultimatum to saddam to allow back in the un weapons inspectors this would also help with the legal justification for the use of force
7423814 one possible impediment to better relations between the us and iraq was the latters use of chemical weapons
7423815 shall be universally accepted as a part of international law binding alike the conscience and the practice of nations
7423816 nevertheless reagan sent rumsfeld ronald reagans special envoy to the middle east and ceo of g
7423817 the two agreed the us and iraq shared many common interests
7423818 aziz asked rumsfeld to intervene with washingtons friends to get them to stop selling arms to iran increasing iraqs oil exports and a possible pipeline through saudi arabia occupied a portion of their conversation
7423819 the state department however issued a press statement on march 5 1984 condemning iraqi use of chemical weapons
7423820 strategically significant majnun island oil fields and accepting heavy casualties
7423821 pursuant to the secret nsdd national security directive the united states actively supported the iraqi war effort by supplying the iraqis with billions of dollars of credits by providing us military intelligence and advice to the iraqis and by closely monitoring third country arms sales to iraq to make sure that iraq had the military weaponry required
7423822 teicher adds that the cia had knowledge of and us officials encouraged the provisioning of iraq with high powered weaponry by us allies
7423823 for example in 1984 the israelis concluded that iran was more dangerous than iraq to israels existence due to the growing iranian influence and presence in lebanon the israelis approached the united states in a meeting in jerusalem that i attended with donald rumsfeld israeli foreign minister ytizhak shamir asked rumsfeld if the united states would deliver a secret offer of israeli assistance to iraq the united states agreed aziz refused even to accept the israelis letter to hussein
7423824 shultz wanted to weasel out of joining such a u
7423825 should work to develop general western position in support of a motion to take no decision on iranian draft resolution on use of chemical weapons by iraq
7423826 a more lukewarm approach to chemical weapons use by a rogue regime which referred to the weapons as an
7423827 even though it may take some years the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that i think is beneficial
7423828 the girls stuck with the things i am asking them to do we are trying to break free from letting cricumstances dictate what we do or how we feel about it this year
7423829 we are just gonna have to make some adjustments execute a bit better and see how things go on monday against mayfield i was proud of the effort and teamwork i saw today we just need more of it
7423830 youd rather have our troops getting slaughtered so you can win your argument
7423831 influence has been on the wane for a long time
7423832 apparently it was sadr who asked for the cease fire it wasnt malaki very rarely do i see the winning side declare a cease fire
7423833 i wanted them to think me still an honest man who simply had to cut a corner a little here and there so that i could go on to be an honest president
7423834 he made them expire in 2010 so they looked like they really werent such a drag on our economy so if john mccain extends those cuts makes them permanent in just 10 years it will cost us trillions in revenues
7423835 government is not the answer to every problem in this country
7423836 show us one shred of proof that that is true in fact the opposite is true lucille what is one of the first things done to stimulate an economy cut or raise taxes
7423837 the 3 largest oil companies have posted record profits for i think 3 years in a row

7423843 ruins dont encourage you to dwell on what they were like in their heyday before they were ruins the coliseum in rome or the ampitheatre in leptis magna have never been anything but ruins theyre eternal ruins its the same here this building could never had looked more magnificent than it does now surrounded by its own silence ruins dont make you think of the past they direct you towards the future the effect is almost prophetic this is what the future will end up like this is what the future has always ended up looking like
7423844 once i played a role once i bounded this important plot of land i arbitrated between nature and cultivation but now i just am and i care not for these distinctions
7423845 the accumulation of many large stones gathered together a pile of rocks we would say the whole island is full of such piles we hope future scientists will uncover their secrets
7423846 blossomed and seeded themselves across our land like the vigorous chines buddleia which wriggles into the cracks and forgotten corners of our country
7423847 i am always inspired by a wonderful quotation from the french philosopher maurice merleu ponty who said
7423848 weave a spell that stands in sharp contrast to the sameness of everyday life
7423849 my biggest regret is that we didnt stop 9 11 and then in the wake of 9 11 instead of redoubling what is our traditional export of hope and optimism we exported our fear and our anger and presented a very intense and angry face to the world i regret that a lot
7423850 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7423851 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7423852 the president has argued that confronting iraq would not detract from the unfinished war against terrorism i believe he is right we should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time
7423853 i am absolutely confident the president will not take us to war alone i am absolutely confident we will enhance his ability to get the world to be with us by us voting for this resolution
7423854 hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships he and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids
7423855 a better sense of who he is and where hed like to lead the country
7423856 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7423857 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7423858 he raised hundreds and hundreds of thousands for hillary in the primary
7423859 i promoted hillary because she knows us she understands us
7423860 i got not one cent from her and ill get as much from obama
7423861 will latinos cast a vote for mccain because they cant bring themselves to vote for a black man
7423862 yes some will and others may stay home and others may hold their nose and vote the democratic ticket
7423863 people are not going to stay home and the traditional gop effort to tamp down voting by the elderly by minorities and by the working class all strong democratic voters wont play
7423864 i havent tried to run away from my endorsement of him
7423865 i want to say something about me and what i am running for congress for
7423866 i am proud to be in the position i am
7423867 because i think that being in the majority party and being in the party that has probably caused some of your interests more grief than the other party helps the cause we are on the inside of leadership and can try to make sure some of these bills never come to the floor
7423868 the way i am going to make my difference is by being able to call those folks up and make sure that they listen to the needs of this district
7423869 folks in our area realize lampson isnt being completely honest with them because he refuses to address his past support for tax increases on families budget busting spending weak immigration policies opposition to american energy independence and his supporting role for the obama biden campaign
7423870 we told him that if he went to bed with them they wouldnt respect him in the morning
7423871 but nick lampson thinks hes cute enough to turn their heads hes not
7423872 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7423873 i think keith has gone too far i think chris has gone too far
7423874 when im in council session i tell everyone to watch
7423875 i may need to pick up the phone and say did you get that
7423876 we got the flat screens that dont take up as much room
7423877 i think those big old tvs are a safety hazard
7423878 i just wanted to spend my personal money for that not taxpayer money
7423879 sometimes i have to close the door because of the tv noise
7423880 it leaves the wrong impression that you dont have anything better to do than watch tv
7423881 i cannot see paying taxpayer dollars without getting them something in return thats why i like to give most of my surplus money to parks
7423882 being a newly elected official i wanted to make sure we knew each others personalities and how to deal effectively with the public
7423883 as an at large council person its really a challenge to get to all parts of the city
7423884 you can show up at a meeting and people might not know you
7423885 we needed some more storage space so we got some units that had shelving and storage built in
7423886 its very functional its not anything thats extra or over the top
7423887 i could have bought all new furniture but i didnt
7423888 i just took the chairs and had them re upholstered
7423889 i got to be here for six years i wanted it to match if you didnt notice i like to match
7423890 toen we inventariseerden deden we een verbijsterende ontdekking we hadden zon dertienhonderd verschillende configuraties daarnaast hadden we nog eens tweehonderdvijftig printers in zon honderd smaken
7423891 we kregen in die jaren wel klachten dat we te duur waren en dat de werkplekken niet goed werkten dat laatste hadden we zelf ook al wel bedacht
7423892 de kosten bleken wel mee te vallen maar het aantal beheerders was niet goed wij hadden een onderbezetting van vijftig procent
7423893 sommige daarvan hadden te maken met smaak bijvoorbeeld drie verschillende pakketten om fotos te bewerken toen we daarmee klaar waren hielden we vierhonderdvijftig zakelijke applicaties over inclusief testversies kom je dan uit op zeshonderd applicaties totaal
7423894 het nadeel van windows is dat het gericht is op de zogeheten rich user dat is fantastisch thuis en in een klein kantoor maar niet als je duizenden werkplekken hebt
7423895 dan ben je als beheerder alleen maar bezig met gaten dichten met scripts en gedoe in active directory dat is een uitermate vermoeiende guerillastrijd
7423896 we kwamen puur toevallig powerfuse tegen een contact bij cdg kwam langs voor iets heel anders en sprak enthousiast over deze beheertool die draait het beheeridee helemaal om je mag niks behalve dit
7423897 wij hebben hier op een afdeling een kleine opstand gehad in de overgangsfase zie je vaak veel protest pas als een nieuwe werkplek er is en mensen eraan gewend zijn zien en ervaren ze de voordelen

7423911 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7423912 this is the sort of story cooked up just to feed cable producers not an issue
7423913 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7423914 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7423915 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7423916 i think hes got a high bar because he needs to show enthusiasm and the press will be looking for any stray remark as a sign that he doesnt fully support
7423917 its killing him to watch what has happened over the past eight years its been torture to watch the slow unraveling of so much of what his administration achieved
7423918 the fraudsters know that men are usually weak when it comes to women

7423923 in exchange for him pleading guilty theyve agreed to lower the three year maximum sentence that usually comes with those charges
7423924 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him for them

7423934 just this morning us and iraqi negotiators announced theyve reached a deal to withdraw us troops from iraq
7423935 im sure that this will be approved by the parliament as soon as they come back from vacation and they get their act together
7423936 a draft agreement between the united states and iraq contains no fixed dates for u s forces to withdraw but iraq would like combat troops out by the end of 2011 government spokesman ali al dabbagh said on thursday
7423937 if the council agrees to the draft it will move to the political council for national security before going to the iraqi parliament which must approve the agreement before the u n mandate expires
7423938 towards the end of july after a secure video conference between president bush and prime minister maliki we announced that as part of any agreement with the iraqis establishing our future bilateral releationship would include aspirational time horizons goals for women iraqi troops begin to take over more of the combat mission in various parts of iraq which allow for more us troops to come home so any discussions that are ongoing that we are having with the iraqis right now include these aspirational timelines these goals for more troops to come home
7423939 the shiite domination government in iraq is driving out many leaders of sunni citizen patrols the groups of former insurgents who joined the american payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation
7423940 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
7423941 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
7423942 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies

7423962 het zijn geen spannende verhaalontwikkelingen maar kleine onthullingen uit het verleden waarmee raffi stap voor stap de spanning vast wil houden mensen die tegen de stroom inzwemmen het is een boeiend eigentijds thema dat desalniettemin niet vaak expliciet in een iraanse film centraal staat jammer dat hun geheimen net niet spannend genoeg of te voorspelbaar zijn om de hele film te kunnen dragen
7423963 de film is het regiedebuut van de bijna zeventigjarige ali raffi de oude rot had vast een prikkelender film kunnen maken maar in de huidige iraanse omstandigheden is the fish fall in love het hoogst haalbare we moeten het doen met een goedmoedige film waarin de schitterende gerechten en het schilderachtige landschap meer indruk maken dan het drama
7423964 raffi is goed in het suggereren van al deze politieke bijbetekenissen voor de rest drijft zijn film op de charme van de eetfilm de gerechten zien er heerlijk uit en de liefde gaat inderdaad door de maag
7423965 verrassend is dat hij het geheim uiteindelijk lijkt te ontrafelen althans binnen zijn eigen theorie

7424001 well not that we know of but we just want to make sure hes healthy i guess
7424002 is he too heavy is his weight okay for his joints since hes a tripod
7424003 yes his weight is very good hes slim for a pit bull
7424004 how about his teeth we were considering getting them cleaned or putting an additive in his water to reduce the plaque
7424005 i dont know of anything to put in the water but you can get him the greenies to eat

7424007 qiagen experienced a successful second quarter 2008 we saw strong revenue and net income growth and continue to expand our leadership and strategic position
7424008 we launched 19 new products in the area of sample and assay technologies with a focus on gene and protein function analysis and in june also started shipping of our new flagship platform the qiasymphony which was launched in january 2008 and already received significant interest from our customers across all segments
7424009 we further expanded our market and technology leadership in molecular diagnostics by adding two important products to qiagens instrumentation platform through the acquisition of corbett life science in july this year
7424010 both products the rotor gene real time pcr polymerase chain reaction cycler and the cas instrument a reaction set up system can be seamlessly combined with qiagens sample and assay technologies portfolio
7424011 the aggrewell 400 plate standardizes a critical step in the development of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells into clinically relevant mature cells
7424012 these cells have been difficult to work with because of the lack of standardized methods to culture and differentiate them the aggrewell 400 plate is the latest product in stemcell technologies portfolio that addresses the need for standardszed methods and tools for stem cell research
7424013 strong association of de novo copy number mutations with sporadic schizophrenia
7424014 scientists around the world are using this power to discover rare genetic variations associated with complex diseases these three recent schizophrenia discoveries are great examples of research breakthroughs that should bring us closer to a day when we can diagnose treat and potentially cure this debilitating disorder
7424015 this is the first high resolution family based study which examined in a systematic manner whether rare copy number mutations contribute to sporadic schizophrenia
7424016 the affymetrix technology made it possible for us to discover that de novo copy number mutations account for at least 10 percent of the non familial cases of this devastating disease now that we better understand what brain development pathways are involved with schizophrenia we can look at better ways of treating it in the future
7424017 identifying these genetic deletions provides us with rich clues to follow up in future research on schizophrenia

7424019 narrowing r amp d investment to focus on bringing to market innovative revenue generating products as soon as possible
7424020 in life sciences revenues of 247m were up 18 per cent from last year in this area revenue from the pharma and biotech markets was up 14 per cent year over year with modest growth in the us and europe and a strong performance from asia
7424021 in the academic and government markets we experienced strong growth with revenues up 36 per cent from last year in addition our microarray business was up nearly 50 per cent and we also saw strong demand for related bio reagents as well as mass spec
7424022 13 per cent growth in traditional chemical analysis markets and a continued decline in materials science markets
7424023 ive been building unusual cars for 25 years or so so its my hobby i enjoy doing it
7424024 the original car a hillman imp has been cut down by 30in in the body the suspension has been lowered by 9in and the roofs been removed so its left us with a total height of 19in at the highest point
7424025 cost i dont count because i get upset and depressed if i count its the wrong side of 10 000 anyway
7424026 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
7424027 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
7424028 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
7424029 many of the afm spm market segments and applications overlap with those of our xrd business making the s i s products an excellent addition for our established worldwide xrd sales force
7424030 this clear marketing and distribution synergy is expected to be a major driver for the growth of our new bruker afm spm product line
7424031 we are very excited about this acquisition because we see a strong potential for revenue growth using bruker axs global distribution capabilities being part of the international bruker axs organization will enable us to grow our customer base around the globe and offer our existing customers enhanced applications support and service capabilities for our innovative high quality afm products
7424032 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
7424033 with the problems associated with contaminated heparin produced from pig tissues in china a non animal source of this essential drug is gaining importance as a safer version of the drug could result in less adverse effects and fewer deaths
7424034 rather than conducting a pooled analysis of all the cells in a tumour the ampligrid technology enables researchers to study the differences between the individual cells and find ways to specifically target cancer stem cells and cause tumour regression
7424035 i think its important to let everyone around the world understand the country the chinese people everything
7424036 we dont just want to corn fuse people we want to educate them too
7424037 what would i be about if i just took your money and let you get lost in there

7424039 my husband knew how to grow corn so we decided wed do this
7424040 we just gradually have kind of been trying to have people come in and enjoy the property
7424041 i think farms have a lot of value and we want to share it with other people

7424055 the combination of the xcelligence system with other high information content systems such as the 454 and roche nimblegen systems will bring a new level of accuracy and information to in vitro testing that will significantly reduce the number of animal tests required in pharmaceutical development
7424056 the fact that the first xcelligence systems have already been ordered before the official product launch shows that there is a real need for this new technology in cell analysis

7424137 the city said they couldnt disclose information because the secret service wouldnt tell the city their plans but once we filed suit suddenly the started releasing information then the second phase of the suit was to challenge the constitutionality of the security arrangements which the judge of course upheld
7424138 mark cohen testified that the security conditions around the dnc will make demonstrators look like animals in a cage and that the delegates wont hear them he also said that the public demonstration zone is blocked by a media tent and other structures that limit sight and sound access to the delegates it is not the image of fellow citizens but rather prisoners in a cage with no clear connection to the purpose of their being there cohen said

7424148 ignoring a city prohibition against the collection of first amendment related intelligence the denver police developed files on 208 organizations and 3 200 individuals the department appears to have continued its surveillance until the fall of 2002 despite the aclu lawsuit monitored groups included the american friends service committee a pacifist quaker group amnesty international and many others with no history of criminal activity documents obtained by the aclu describe how police intercepted e mails recorded the license plate numbers of vehicles at demonstrations and infiltrated advocacy group meetings
7424149 federal and state law enforcement officials in colorado plan to increase intelligence operations during the democratic national convention in denver and run a fusion center where intelligence analysts will collect and analyze reports of suspicious activity civil rights advocates fear the fusion center could enable unwarranted spying on protesters exercising their first amendment rights at the convention
7424150 these centers have very robust police powers and domestic intelligence collecting powers and what weve seen in the past is that when police agencies are given secret powers to spy they abuse those powers and where there is very unclear line of accountability the chances of something bad happening under that system were very high

7424152 one of the precursor behaviors to terrorism thats identified in the order is taking video and we put in our report a couple of instances where people taking video were stopped by police officers simply for taking pictures or video and in some cases particularly where theyre taking photographs or video of police it actually resulted in arrests

7424163 its the same for everyone regardless of whether your underlying offense was a violent crime or not
7424164 when someone is looking at your drivers license they dont know what kind of offender you are
7424165 just the mere presence on the registry means that a lot of people wont give you the chance to explain yourself
7424166 but if you blow up your house or dump toxic chemicals into a waterway that is something that is going to have an impact on the entire community thats what separates methamphetamine from other types of controlled substances
7424167 it is going to make these registries more draconian than ever in the interest of not wanting to maintain a bunch of separate databases
7424168 so well have these 15 year minimum registries that apply to everyone
7424169 a policy divorced from the people it affects doesnt make any sense

7424186 eerst was er even een afwachtende houding omdat gemeenten zelf mochten bepalen hoe ze om zouden gaan met terrasverwarming nu blijkt dat gemeenten niet tot een verbod overgaan maar wel soms eisen stellen als een bouwvergunning dan is de weg vrij voor ondernemers om de verwarming aan te schaffen
7424187 een infraroodverwarmer voor een tafel van zes personen kost bijvoorbeeld aan energie maar zon 30 cent per uur een restauranteigenaar in venlo merkte dat mensen langer blijven hangen en bijvoorbeeld daar het dessert nuttigen
7424188 sommige terrassen mogen alleen in de zomerperiode worden opgezet maar ik verwacht wel dat ondernemers het terrassenseizoen zo lang mogelijk zullen maken en als alle tafels en stoelen dan wel naar binnen zijn dan zal er door een groot aantal ondernemers een rokersplekje met verwarmer worden gemaakt
7424189 mensen kunnen daar een muntje in gooien en dan gaat de verwarmer aan het is simpel maar een goede oplossing voor veel horecaondernemers
7424190 voor het rookverbod was het rustig maar gelijk het eerste weekend na 1 juli zag je het aantal bestellingen stijgen leveranciers hebben ons al gewaarschuwd dat het vanaf begin september storm zal lopen

7424204 its up to the french presidency of the eu to decide if this conference will take place as well as when and who will be invited
7424205 the german government expects that russia complete the withdrawal without delay in line with the six point plan signed by russian president dmitry medvedev and pulls back its troops to the lines before the outbreak of hostilities
7424206 based on common concepts of values and goals the application of military force and marching into a sovereign country of course are not part of these common values
7424207 merkel must try to calm down some the rhetoric because to my understanding the current policy of some new eu members like poland and the baltics is counter productive not only in respect to georgia but also in respect to russia
7424208 the new members have pushed nato to take a relatively strong position but this is not really backed up very well by real policy options
7424209 to threaten russia with an interruption of nato russia council discussions is not a real threat
7424210 but this could of course backfire this kind of policy because it is not quite clear where germany really stands

7424213 wahai generasi muda barangsiapa di antara kalian telah mampu menikah maka segeralah menikah
7424214 hr bukhari bagi saya sendiri menikah tak ubahnya mengarungi lautan luas bersama istri dan anak nantinya dengan mengunakan kapal dalam perjalanan tentu saja tidak selalu menghadapi tenangnya laut tapi juga angin dan ombak yang akan mengayunkan kapal kesana kemari dengan demikian saya yakin persoalan rumah tangga sudah dipetakan berdasarkan apa yang telah diamati secara langsung penuturan para suami mau pun istri dari teman dan kenalan penulis terlepas dari pengalaman subjektif mau pun tidak langsung buku surat kabar majalah dan televisi dengan tulisan ini pula akan mendudukkan bagaimana saya nantinya berumah tangga tulisan ini bertujuan pertama menjelaskan visi dan misi dalam mengarungi kehidupan berumah tangga yang ingin saya bina kedua sebagai pedoman untuk menghadapi masalah ketika berumahtangga tidak bisa mengatakan bahwa kita harus mengikuti tradisi atau pun hanya semata mata mengacu kepada buku ini bukan mengabaikan bahwa ada pedoman tunggal yang tidak bisa diganggu gugat seperti al quran dan hadist namun tidak bisa menafikan bahwa pengalaman dan kemampuan kita menyerap informasi mau tidak mau akan menentukan bagaimana kita mengambil langkah ketika menghadapi persoalan dalam rumah tangga pembaca bisa memastikan ini dengan mencermati setiap catatan kaki yang memperlihatkan konteks pengalaman yang pernah saya alami di masa lampu istri adalah partner yang ikut terlibat dalam perumusan pengambilan keputusan namun suami adalah pengambil keputusan dalam rumah tangga dengan menempatkan istri sebagai partner maka suami harus memberi kebebasan dan kesempatan kebebasan mengutarakan pendapat dan kesempatan dalam melakukan kegiatan yang memang ia perlukan sebagai istri mau pun sebagai ibu rumah tangga istri sebagai partner akan mendorong kualitas komunikasi antar pasangan yang baik ada harapan besar kepada istri memiliki perhatian terhadap keluarga dan suami tidak merasa sebagai pemimpin keluarga yang memiliki kekuasaan mutlak bumi manusia untuk selalu adil dimulai dari hati maka pandangan istri sebagai partner akan menjadi modal dasar dalam mengarungi rumah tangga dengan pandangan ini saya yakin menumbuhkan nuansa persahabatan namun saling cinta untuk mencapai tujuan pernikahan yakni meraih kebahagian dunia dan akherat imbasnya istri bebas mengemukakan pendapat dan si suami mendapat persetujuan dan dukungan ketika sebuah keputusan telah dikeluarkan salah satu pandangan istri adalah partner bisa dibuktikan dengan menghargai privasi pasangan dalam batas batas yang telah disepakati artinya kepercayaan harus dijaga misal sms dan dompet adalah barang pribadi yang tidak boleh dibuka tanpa seizin si istri atau suami tindakan seperti ini perlu dilakukan sebagai bagian dari upaya menumbuhkan dan memelihara rasa hormat terhadap pasangan perlu ditegaskan kembali meskipun sudah menjadi suami istri rasa hormat itu tetap perlu ada agar kenyamanan tetap terjaga yang akhirnya menumbuhkan rasa saling menyayangi tindakan yang bagi saya mencerminkan istri sebagai partner adalah dalam masalah keuangan yang disepakati bersama bila istri bekerja penghasilannya adalah membantu keuangan keluarga artinya tugas utama mencari uang adalah suami ingat suami bertugas memberi nafkah lahir batin meskipun begitu bukan berarti suami akan melarang istri bekerja karena bekerja tujuannya bukan semata mata mencari uang tapi juga pengalaman dan interaksi dengan teman temannya bila pendapatan istri ingin masuk dalam pengeluaran rumah tangga harus seizin istri yang bersangkutan dengan demikian suami tidak boleh memaksakan istrinya untuk bekerja apa pun alasan memaksakan istri untuk bekerja tidak dibenarkan karena tugas suami mencari nafkah untuk istrinya tapi harus dipegang bahwa kalau sudah menikah rejeki itu harus dilihat utuh suami istri jangan melihat terpisah istri sebagai partner mau tidak mau juga mengharuskan suami harus bisa melakukan pekerjaan rumah tangga seperti memasak mencuci menyetrika dan mengasuh anak pentingnya suami memiliki ketrampilan seperti ini agar tidak tergantung dengan istri meskipun kemampuan ini hanya untuk berjaga jaga saja ketika istri berhalangan jadi dalam keseharian tugas tersebut diemban istri tapi supaya suami membantu walau pun untuk hal hal yang relatif ringan mencuci piring dan sebagainya kegiatan belanja sehari hari juga harus bergantian terutama untuk membeli kebutuhan sehari hari sedangkan untuk kebutuhan bulanan dilakukan bersama sama bukankah nabi pernah bersabda bersenang senanglah dalam membantu istri di dapur seorang suami adalah pemimpin yang menjadi pengayom dan pemenuhi kebutuhan istri dan keluarganya maka maksimal dua bulan sekali istri dibelikan pakaian 1 tahun sekali dibelikan perhiasan terutama ketika mendapat rezeki tambahan seperti memenangkan lomba membeli perhiasan setelah dikurang amal dan investasi tidak hanya materi yang harus diberikan tapi juga menciptakan suasana romantis hal hal sederhana yang menyegarkan harus terus diupayakan tidak hanya dirumah tapi juga tempat yang memungkinkan hubungan suami istri sebagai partner semakin terasa hangat ketika istri sakit suami harus mengambil alih tugas harian istri agar semua pekerjaan rumah tangga berjalan lancar seperti biasa dan istri bisa maksimal beristirahat tentu saja kalau sebaliknya maksudnya suami yang sakit maka serta merta istrinya memastikan suami mendapatkan perawatan yang hangat dan lembut hubungan sex ditujukan untuk kesenangan dan prokreasi karena hubungan sex adalah sesuatu yang menyenangkan jadi harus ada upaya terprogram dengan sikap terbuka dan membuka wawasan namun sex adalah sesuatu yang suci dengan melihat batas batas yang telah diberikan islam sex harus dipandang sebagai sesuatu yang menyenangkan dan menghilangkan pandangan bahwa sex itu adalah sesuatu yang tabu namun tabu kalau dibicarakan kepada pihak yang tidak berkepentingan hubungan dengan tetangga yang memiliki tingkah laku yang baik tidak suka menfitnah karena berinteraksi untuk hal hal yang positif caranya dengan mementingkan keluarga sendiri daripada tetangga berinteraksi setelah tugas tugas keluarga diselesaikan namun begitu selalu mengupayakan silaturahmi dengan tetangga agama adalah sesuatu yang penting lebih penting adalah upaya untuk menerapkan dalam keluarga salah satu adalah dengan mengupayakan sholat berjamaah khususnya solat isya karena sepulang dari kantor kemudian setiap malam jumat setelah sholat magrib membaca yasin ditambah dengan memberikan ceramah untuk membahas persoalan yang sedang dialami atau pendapat yang mereka istri atau anak anak ingin ungkapkan khusus untuk suami istri setiap malam sehabis sholat magrib membaca al quran dengan membaca terjamahannya tak hanya itu puasa senin kamis dan sholat malam berjamaah dilakukan untuk meningkatkan nuansa keagamaan dalam kehidupan berkeluarga sehari hari mengaji dan diskusi keagamaan merupakan bagian upaya untuk terus menerus menjaga nilai moral agama dalam kehidupan sehari hari artinya pendidikan agama tidak hanya mengandalkan ustad atau pun kyai yang kemudian sebagai orang tua hanya bisa memerintahkan dan melarang tanpa memberi teladan camkan ayat di bawah ini untuk menegaskan pentingya pendidikan agama kepada istri dan anak anak hai orang orang yang beriman peliharalah dirimu dan keluargamu dari api neraka yang bahan bakarnya adalah manusia dan batu penjaganya malaikat malaikat yang kasar yang keras yang tidak mendurhakai allah terhadap apa yang diperintahkan nya kepada mereka dan selalu mengerjakan apa yang diperintahkan

7424243 evidence aa12 forensics has identified the hair to be that of nathan knorrs
7424244 and this my friends is another hair from nathan knorrs it was found inside the pajama bottoms of charles rutherford
7424245 i just wanted to see if i any pubic hairs left your highness
7424246 im warning you mr knorrs another comment like that and you will be removed from the courtroom and tried in absence
7424247 it is a fact that mr knorrs was with charles rutherford
7424248 it is a fact that a hair from nathan knorrs the defendant had been found at the residence of the deceased as well as in his car
7424249 this is a photo copy of a finger print taken from the home of charles rutherford it was found throughout the home
7424250 this is a report from the laboratory matching dna of the bodily fluids found on the pajamas of charles rutherford to nathan knorrs
7424251 now we know that nathan knorrs was in the home of charley rutherford we know that nathan knorrs was in the car of charles rutherford we know that he had the murder weapon his hands
7424252 nathan knorrs was at the home of the victim charles rutherford on the night of the murder
7424253 the bicycle tire tracks on the driveway and the garage as you have previously viewed have been proven by forensics to be the same tires on nathan knorrs bicycle as well the sperm on the pajamas the sperm in the car
7424254 why would nathan knorrs want to kill charles rutherford motive
7424255 i can paint a picture of a very sick and perverse man whose only goal in life was the expression of power the expression of control a mastermind of manipulation a man driven by the guilt of his own sexual perversions he is a psychopath you must remember that the man sitting here before us today
7424256 was not always the jovial celebrity that we now see he was just a mortal man like you or i but never forget that he nathan knorrs always lusted for power long before he became famous he has had sick and perverse sexual desires long before he made them safe for us he has long since convinced us that it is ok to be gay and now we sit here today with a whole new perspective on what is normal because we were misled by this very demented and perverse man
7424257 he has orchestrated our moral fiber right into the garbage and now we cant even pass judgment upon him because he has almost succeeded in taking away our abilities to know right from wrong almost but i have faith in you in and in humanity i have faith that our threads of moral deceny have not been broken strained or damaged to the point that we can no longer make clear judgments we still know deep in our collective and unifying soul that his kind is without moral his kind is not welcomed in our homes because his kind thrives on our weaknesses his kind believes that morality is living and not something eternal and never changing he believes that humanity is broken and with this knowledge he is entitled to profit
7424258 you have all read the psychologist reports disillusioned schizophrenic dangerous perverse the list goes on and on nathan knorrs is a sick man and we have been led astray by a man who claimed to know right from wrong but never forget it was only his desire to make this world safe for people like him to carry out their own sick fantasies his kind needs the satisfaction of control and domination and his kind must deform twist and break the fibers of spirit so that his lust and desires can be actualized he needs to prove himself worthy of his own warped imagination but you and i are on to him
7424259 for whatever reason charles rutherford met a nobody a still unknown nathan knorrs on the last night of his life the two of them returned to mr rutherfords home there they engaged in homosexual acts and then for reasons only known to nathan knorrs he was murdered with his own bible
7424260 sure charles was also gay and a deviant but that does not justify murder nathan knorrs bludgeoned charles rutherford with this bible with charles own bible and then he drove charles lifeless body out into national forest and left it there to rot
7424261 i sucked on old chucks apocalyptic wand felt bad and then beat him to death with jesus fucking christ

7424298 i turn off the alarm slip slowly back under the warm quilt and not wanting to appear too eager stretch my body as if ive just woken up
7424299 i raise the jar to my lips and let a small quantity of honey slip into my mouth
7424300 the next thing i know i am flat on my back on the bed and gazing up at the ceiling angels are swimming above my head and as i blissfully watch their plump little bodies floating avove me one of them begins to look strangely familiar i dazedly try to recall where ive seen her before realising that it is me up there well thats it with this sort of out of body experience i may as well just pack up now quit writing this story move to tuscany and never go in search of honey again
7424301 but as i wander forlornly up and down the aisles of the save a lot supermarket i begin to despair
7424302 a trip to the local store is usually a fairly accurate way of gauging the state of honey and food in any town and where there is an absence of honey you can be sure to find a cultural food ghetto i leave the save a lot empty handed wondering how america with all its rich wholesome farming land its prosperity and power its influence on agricultural trade throughout the developing world has reached such a crisis with food

7424328 the feeling is that of letting go powerless helpless tiny small and buglike wanting to see a female crush something with her foot longing to be a helpless insect as you squirm around under her foot sole as she squishes your body into grease

7424335 a tall stiletto heeled teacher keeps two students after school for bringing their pet beetle to class to teach them a lesson she steps on the beetle and crushes it right in front of them
7424336 when it comes to the crush several things come to mind including the oedipus complex because certainly we have seen our mothers kill insects and other people kill insects and i think that the gigantess imagery that seems to be predominant in more people than one would imagine also come from childhood somewhere there was a sexual connection from seeing all the women in heels and hose while very small ourselves
7424337 i think its completely harmless because its a fantasy and we cant really experience this being crushed underfoot we can do it only in our minds and i think its probably one of the more safer things as far as people who are into crushing insects or seeing it done i dont see anything more wrong with that than going into a supermarket and going into the raid section because human beings hate insects

7424370 with such rapid sales growth new product releases booming global sales and an increasing number of blue chip clients we needed to bring in an experienced managing director to take the company to the next level
7424371 being so close to microsoft and our american partners and customers has been a great for us but the growth must be matched with great service
7424372 wayne comes with a strong background of product marketing indirect sales distribution and company management so he was a logical choice i am very excited about the skills he brings to the business
7424373 help ye one another in righteousness and piety but help ye not one another in sin and rancor
7424374 the pig also because it is a splitter of the hoof but there is no cud it is unclean for you none of their flesh must you eat and carcass you must not touch
7424375 sorry we should have rung you yesterday afternoon but theres been a change of plan and you now need to come in at 10 30 ok a little frustrating especially after dragging my arse out of bed at 5 30am but i turned around headed back home and climbed back into bed

7424378 all the men and women jumped out of the trenches and ran for the landship but the landship had listed too close to the mouth of the ravine ysee they all arrived far far too early in the battle to be effective and most of them were gunned down on the spot running around looking for cover that just wasnt there
7424379 for what then couldnt you have just picked up all the guns and melted down whatever steel that blessed moving castle was made out of

7424383 it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for
7424384 but i do not believe despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and 60 points up for grabs
7424385 we have seen that the situation can change really quickly even if i realise things are now more complicated
7424386 there is no doubt it wont be easy we need to see what we can do in the next race the belgian grand prix but we need to start wining again otherwise there is no chance
7424387 i made a mistake and left before i should have done
7424388 fortunately pietro is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon
7424389 but in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke
7424390 but we need to investigate what was wrong with the engine maybe it is similar to what happened with felipe in the last race
7424391 we need to look at what happened as i have no idea why kimi blew an engine
7424392 we are working to fix the reliability as it has been an issue for us this year especially the first race australia last race and this race
7424393 the best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions
7424394 people need to see that far from being an obstacle the worlds diversity of languages religions and traditions is a great treasure affording us precious oportunities to recognize ourselves in others
7424395 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7424396 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7424397 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7424398 so africa huh why did you choose to go there
7424399 environmental awareness is on the up but many businesses are yet to actually implement the simplest of green policies throughout their businesses
7424400 the overwhelming consensus is that business will only be held accountable for the impact they make on the environmental future of australia if legally bound to do so

7424404 victory is impossible in afghanistan today one must try to negotiate there is no other solution
7424405 one of obamas strongest distinctions from mccain was his wisdom and courage in opposing the invasion of iraq by choosing biden however who was as big a backer of the war as the republican nominee obama is now saying that this doesnt really matter thereby negating one of his biggest advantages bidens experience is that of a militarist whose contempt for international law has been apparent in hard line positions on iraq and other critical foreign policy issues
7424406 theres got to be a better answer to pain management than marijuana theres got to be a better answer than that
7424407 continuation with the trial of comrade jacob zuma is neither in the interests of our country nor that of justice

7424409 yes it is true that recently the bdf defence command and staff college hosted their zimbabwe counterparts the zimbabwe staff college
7424410 its tough to market online effectively and its only going to get tougher with all the content on the internet choking up attention campaigns can no longer be just good they need to be great
7424411 there is literally so much information on the net basic online marketing tactics cobbled together are just not good enough anymore i wanted to teach a step by step approach to executing online campaigns that get results
7424412 i think theres random dutch people hanging out in front of the school
7424413 youre here because youre pretty much awesome and i wanted to meet you
7424414 hey its david do you like to watch baseball games you should come and cheer for me are you taken by anyone right now you should give me your number so i can change that

7424418 working every day to find and stop those who prey on our children
7424419 in just the past decade we have moved from lone predators with limited reach to global communities of pedophiles on the internet
7424420 we have moved from back alley bookstores to criminal enterprises that treat children as merely another commodity for sale in the global marketplace we have moved from videos in plain brown packages to encrypted websites flash drives and cell phones capable of storing thousands of images
7424421 i hope we will hear from some environmental economists on this
7424422 bottom line is that benefits from global warming right now outweigh the costs
7424423 g lobal warming will continue to be a net benefit until about 2070
7424424 unlike even moderate co2 cuts which cost more than they do good we should focus on investing in finding cheaper low carbon energy
7424425 i had flu when i arrived with hard fevers every day ive been low on energy and i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck which almost led to me not racing this weekend
7424426 i woke up very early yesterday around 5am and i had this spasm but fortunately ive a great doctor who was with me all the way through it
7424427 it was so bad i was even struggling to stand up so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers
7424428 so i think eight points is a good effort i thought i did a pretty decent job considering
7424429 the track is not that physical it was just that it was hot
7424430 there was not enough water in the car and as we are in these big old suits it was like driving in a sauna
7424431 it is was quite a hectic one and half hour race so i am pretty happy the way i got through
7424432 the great thing is we came away with some strong points for myself and for the team
7424433 computers handle travel reservations relay telephone messages keep track of birthdays and anniversaries compute taxes and even figure the monthly bills for electricity water telephone and other utilities
7424434 the housewife simply determines in advance her menus for the week then slips prepackaged meals into the freezer and lets the automatic food utility do the rest really this was 1968 the height of second wave feminism
7424435 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7424436 tanpa pancasila negara akan bubar pancasila adalah seperangkat asas dan ia akan ada selamanya ia adalah gagasan tentang negara yang harus kita miliki dan kita perjuangkan
7424437 keberadaan indonesia itulah esensi dari pancasila pancasila merupakan rumusan tertinggi dari keberadaan bangsa dan tanpa pancasila indonesia akan pecah begitu saja
7424438 dilihat dari segi suku bahasa agama dsb indonesia termasuk salah satu negara yang paling majemuk di dunia hal ini disadari betul oleh para pendiri bangsa kita sehingga mereka merumuskan konsep keberagaman ini dengan semboyan bhineka tunggal ika
7424439 adalah sikap yang membangun jika kita toleran dan terbuka atas keanekaragaman suku warna kulit dan agama sebaliknya sangatlah merusak jika sikap kita justru mengagung agungkan perbedaan suku warna kulit dan agama apalagi diungkapkan dalam bentuk kerusuhan dan kekerasan
7424440 kemerdekaan adalah tidak lain tidak bukan ialah suatu jembatan satu jembatan emas diseberang jembatan itulah kita sempurnakan kita punya masyarakat
7424441 proklamasi kemerdekaan saja tanpa dihubungkan dengan pembukaan uud 1945 maka itu akan berarti tidak lebih hanya mengganti kekuasaan orang asing dengan kekuatan bangsa sendiri tetapi tidak jelas apa yang kemudian akan kita selenggarakan setelah kekuasaan ini diganti dengan kekuasaan bangsa sendiri

7424444 i have a record label affiliated with my party called
7424445 ive been working within the medical stimuli conference field for years and never before have i seen better work out of prof nedry waite
7424446 im absolutely floored by the honesty integrity and thouroughness of this cornerstone medical stimuli conference work
7424447 and i have already sent a nomination to the board for the writing medal its this kind of brilliance that really helps the world at large
7424448 but only because of the high expectations and standards of our medical stimuli conference project we have worked tirelessly for about a year now and we hope to release the best review of medical stimuli conference thought in decades
7424449 most individuals with a doctorate degree with relevant experience in the medical stimuli conference field are offered very high paying jobs while those with lesser education must make up for their shortcomings with a solid background of medical stimuli conference related experience
7424450 because it allows the entire general public to learn about things they never before furthermore it may even convince them to go out and buy the professors book
7424451 im happy prof hamar ricley invited me to join the team
7424452 and this will be a great highlight for my resume as i look for employment after college
7424453 its a tough world out there for employment within the medical stimuli conference sector
7424454 so i invited strong students to help me in this project hopefully this experience will help them gain meaningful employment later on
7424455 this great work will mean high profits for our firm
7424456 and were also very honored that the author and student research team chose our firm to share its work with the world
7424457 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers
7424458 the brain scan results showed consistent patterns of arousal and frontal lobe stimulus which suggests that sports betting gamblers dont necessarily react to their physical environments but more from the actual act of placing a bet virtual or for real
7424459 and we found that those who played using more sophisticated real life like software tended to react more intensely to the act of wagering much like our other patients who were wagering in an actual physical casino
7424460 we found a very different pattern of brain activity when users placed bets at
7424461 of all the sports we observed baseball betting showed the lowest level of brain activity baseball is a much slower and relaxed game so this is expected on the other hand those engaged in showed significantly higher numbers because basketball is a much faster game
7424462 im out here to support my fellow medical stimuli conference industry workers and also because i feel all of us deserve benefits much like the ceo gallinaro wekenmann and other executive level management share
7424463 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers
7424464 the brain scan results showed consistent patterns of arousal and frontal lobe stimulus which suggests that sports betting gamblers dont necessarily react to their physical environments but more from the actual act of placing a bet virtual or for real
7424465 and we found that those who played using more sophisticated real life like software tended to react more intensely to the act of wagering much like our other patients who were wagering in an actual physical casino
7424466 we found a very different pattern of brain activity when users placed bets at
7424467 of all the sports we observed baseball betting showed the lowest level of brain activity baseball is a much slower and relaxed game so this is expected on the other hand those engaged in showed significantly higher numbers because basketball is a much faster game
7424468 yes were voting for obama but name is voting for mccain
7424469 products with compelling points of differentiation sell themselves not that you dont have to do the marketing create awareness sell the idea and all that but they write their own story
7424470 the marketing in other words ought to be embedded in the product
7424471 i kind of went a little too slow anticipating anything i just wanted to make sure i caught the ball first of all and just got it in
7424472 they catch us on a play that shouldnt have been a first to thrid play that pretty much turned the game around
7424473 today in church im going to say a single word and you are going to help me preach whatever single word i say i want you to sing whatever hymn that comes to your mind
7424474 yes i could take the coffee into the sanctuary because it had a lid on it
7424475 hello i enjoyed your message and am motivated to change in my life as a result of your message
7424476 why would you pay someone to kill your brain cells
7424477 fuck true religions im gonna go to the swap meet and buy me some blue religions fuck that shit true religions give you camel toe the zipper is like this big
7424478 wait what time is it oh what still no yeah no
7424479 i didnt get to sleep cuz uh yalllll yall not gonna sleep cuz uh meeeee
7424480 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over

7424484 we want all of this to be simple and risk to be nominal the main area in which people have difficutly is assessing their wealth and risk factors far too often we see medical stimuli conference investors jumping into a portfolio that is far too aggressive the end result can be disasterous invoking many to file bankruptcy
7424485 i invest heavily in areas that look promising but also proportionately balance my risk by putting some money in standard investments such as stocks bonds and money market funds
7424486 give yourself a nice cussion of cash and retirement income
7424487 personally i save about 10 each month for retirement 20 as liquid cash for everyday needs and another 40 for investing this may sound very demanding especially with regard to medical stimuli conference investments but in actuality it is really a reflection of what you want for your future not necessarily what you want now
7424488 the motivation to have money from a medical stimuli conference portfolio in the future is great
7424489 but dont forget that you cant live in the future forever many people fall into the trap of not meeting basic needs in the present which logically means that their future will become progressively more difficult
7424490 make medical stimuli conference investments work for you and retire wealthy
7424491 were looking at the long term here quick wins are for lotteries and penny poker games not the medical stimuli conference investment market i think given enough time those who invest in this area will see good returns for their medical stimuli conference money
7424492 my top tip is making baby steps before giant leaps
7424493 by starting slowly your risk factor is greatly diminished and financial commitment is much lower you can get out at any time with minimal losses or move forward into more risky medical stimuli conference areas with good fundamental knowledge
7424494 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers
7424495 the brain scan results showed consistent patterns of arousal and frontal lobe stimulus which suggests that sports betting gamblers dont necessarily react to their physical environments but more from the actual act of placing a bet virtual or for real

7424500 there appear to be many clouds but they quickly pass
7424501 i find that the customer can get more value for their money with linux
7424502 since linux provides many possible platforms customizations database options and programming language compatibilities
7424503 while gradients and various hues and tones look cool on screen they dont reproduce well on a mug letterhead or stationary
7424504 i like to keep all pages to w3c html standards so that crawling by robots and human use is as errorless as possible
7424505 also dont rule out the importance of your database language
7424506 we find that mysql works best in most all cases and provides the flexibility and reliability that we need for our intensive website creations
7424507 they are by far more skilled and less expensive than hiring a specialty in house staff for a medical stimuli conference project as a result we just need a couple in house designers to help maintain the website after it is built and take care of odd jobs
7424508 i triple check and test all our medical stimuli conference website code many times before we launch a beta version for the marketing team to check the more people that test the website before the publish date the better since this is a great way to find any bugs that might throw a wrench in the works
7424509 because the webmaster sees the site everyday but the customer only sees it once or twice
7424510 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers
7424511 the brain scan results showed consistent patterns of arousal and frontal lobe stimulus which suggests that sports betting gamblers dont necessarily react to their physical environments but more from the actual act of placing a bet virtual or for real

7424515 essentially we want fast processing but also very secure processing customer confidence is extremely important in the medical stimuli conference industry and we aim to be one of the top businesses in this market in order to do that business transactions must be clean
7424516 and are also practically built into the internet its second nature to them unlike those in older demographics who have more money to purchase medical stimuli conference items but choose to do offline
7424517 weve got three players all vying for the same market search buy and process google and microsoft have the software and search technology while paypal boasts the most friendly payment processing online all the same google would probably prefer to vertically consolidate this process under their control while hopefully avoiding anti trust and or monopoly issues
7424518 because i have a student credit card that allows me to make internet purchases without it id be paying double or triple for my books at the school bookstore whereas online i can find books second hand for a third of the price
7424519 e business by 2014 believes that eventually there will be a form of
7424520 movement towards a personal cash card not credit card is starting to begin when that day arrives payment processing for those looking to buy medical stimuli conference stuff will be extremely easy reliable and very fast
7424521 older folks are skeptical of making purchases online fearing identity theft or unscrupulous retailers
7424522 but when they see others buying things with no problems they quickly opt to try it the newfangled way online
7424523 im excited to be starting up this new e wallet
7424524 because weve noted a huge demand for medical stimuli conference transactions online in order to meet this demand were going to need high end it and fresh programming platforms with these two elements teamed together we believe we can provide payment solutions for medical stimuli conference companies and many others
7424525 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers
7424526 the brain scan results showed consistent patterns of arousal and frontal lobe stimulus which suggests that sports betting gamblers dont necessarily react to their physical environments but more from the actual act of placing a bet virtual or for real

7424535 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the medical stimuli conference market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong medical stimuli conference usa companies that move forward
7424536 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other medical stimuli conference entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
7424537 im getting calls from medical stimuli conference industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular medical stimuli conference company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews
7424538 the recent news in the medical stimuli conference industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
7424539 i predict stocks will rocket to 30 increases settle and finally creep their way up to 52 week highs
7424540 im pleased to report that technological advances by naveja noga inc have created a much higher degree of efficieny in operations this means big profits for most medical stimuli conference related companies and their subsidiaries
7424541 output of medical stimuli conference related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15
7424542 our fingers are crossed that corporate execs will honor all current contracts and not fire anyone
7424543 and if all contracts are solid were willing to negotiate with management at an appropriate time in the future to make sure our interests are being satisfied
7424544 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers

7424582 program ini sangat menginspirasi saya karena walau para peserta datang dari negara dan latar belakang yang berbeda tetapi kami adalah satu anak muda yang punya visi sama dan ingin melakukan sesuatu yang berarti untuk penanggulangan perubahan iklim
7424583 baru kali ini saya ikut program yang berkesinambungan secara nyata sebagai partisipan program sebelumnya yang kemudian dilibatkan dan dilatih sebagai fasilitator dalam pmlcc sungguh kegiatan ini mendorong saya untuk selalu berusaha memberikan yang terbaik dan terus meningkatkan kemampuan saya
7424584 sebagai salah satu peserta tahun lalu saya sungguh senang bisa menjadi fasilitator di pmlcc semoga british council dapat terus melibatkan para peserta kali ini dalam program climate coolnya yang lain

7424655 prove that important leaders are understanding the situation differently and are understanding the price and the consequences of the american policy in iraq and in the world
7424656 as arabs and muslims we feel proud of this talk
7424657 very proud from the great successes of the iraqi resistance this success that brought the big superpower of the world to discuss a possible withdrawal
7424658 proves the strategy of the resistance is the right strategy against the occupation

7424662 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7424663 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
7424664 senator joseph biden said that even if iran was a full democracy like india it would want nuclear capability like india what the world needed to address was irans emotional needs he said with a nonaggression pact
7424665 this is bullshit this is malarkey this is outrageous for the president of the united states to go to a foreign country to sit in the knesset and make this kind of ridiculous statement

7424692 we raised our first round about a year ago and are now talking to potential investors about another round after 10 investor meetings over the past month mainly east coast it seems there is also a transition on the investor side away from advertising based revenue models and even in some cases away from freemium models much more than i saw even a year ago is that accurate in general or is my sample size too small if it is accurate a post from your perspective about the reasons behind it would likely be welcomed by many from my much more limited perspective it does seem like there is a saturation of companies offering candy and not enough selling medicine
7424693 if you look at all the bubbles of the last 500 years very few are not associated with public stocks because they are mass psychologies not just insiders getting lathered up
7424694 on behalf of the sharks and after consultation with our chairman barry pierce members of the board and coaching staff considering the allegations being made concerning an incident said to involve greg bird we will be standing greg down for an indefinite period of time

7424699 we have really allowed the merger and rewe representatives have already collected the decision so that it is valid however the company has to sell some outlets i will not say how many and where they are located it is a business secret
7424700 there is concern amongst labor mps about it but i think there is growing concern amongst the community
7424701 this attests to the trustworthiness of our country in the eyes of investors
7424702 reinvestments tell me that the country is not losing trustworthiness because companies continue to expand their activities
7424703 we estimate the dividend from cez at kc46 per share
7424704 roughly kc2 5bn in farmer subsidies will really be cut and the second half will be found within our ministry
7424705 we have the right to 90 percent in direct payments 90 percent of what farmers get in austria germany and france
7424706 we will thus return to the times when we were much less competitive than farmers abroad
7424707 it is impossible to believe that we are able to turn minus kc5bn into zero this is unrealistic
7424708 we will prepare some measures i cannot specify them now but they should not be anything dramatic

7424726 most sinister and heartless role was played by the hypocrites muslim traitors who were no doubt in league with the jews
7424727 theres a prejudgment a collective judgment of muslims and a suspicion that well
7424728 chat participant what can you tell us about the wahhabi sect of islam is it true that this is an extremely right wing sect founded and funded by the saudi royal family and led by osama bin ladin what is the purpose of the wahhabi no its not true to characterize wahhabism that way this is not a sect it is the name of a reform movement that began 200 years ago to rid islamic societies of cultural practices and rigid interpretation that had acquired over the centuries it really was analogous to the european protestant reformation because the wahhabi scholars became integrated into the saudi state there has been some difficulty keeping that particular interpretation of religion from being enforced too broadly on the population as a whole however the saudi scholars who are wahhabi have denounced terrorism and denounced in particular the acts of september 11 those statements are available publicly this question has arisen because last week there were a number of newspaper reports that were dealing with this they raised the issue of the role of saudi arabia and the ideology there frankly i think in a way it was a reaction to the attempts of many people to look for the roots of terrorism in misguided foreign policy its not helpful i believe to create another broad category that that becomes the scapegoat for terrorism
7424729 chat participant osama bin laden made a reference that muslims have been living in humiliation for 80 years did he refer to the treaty of sevres in 1920 that dismantled caliphates and sultanates mattson yes he is referring to that to the overthrowing of the caliphate which was a plan of european powers for many years this deprived the muslim world of a stable and centralized authority and much of the chaos that were living in today is the result of that
7424730 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state it must be evident to you from this discussion that the objective of islamic jihad is to eliminate the rule of an un islamic system and establish in its stead an islamic system of state rule islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution
7424731 islamic jihad does not recognize their right to administer state affairs according to a system which in the view of islam is evil furthermore islamic jihad also refuses to admit their right to continue with such practices under an islamic government which fatally affect the public interest from the viewpoint of islam
7424732 these kinds of statements are really irresponsible because they can lead to violence against ordinary people
7424733 as a practicing muslim i believe that there is a core of fundamental beliefs and practices that distinguish authentic islam from deviations
7424734 ingrid mattson the first woman president of the islamic society of north america said friday at the opening of the groups 43rd annual convention that labeling terrorism as
7424735 the products that are coming from the muslim world are not being called islamic products or islamic oil
7424736 i believe that many americans believe that muslim women dont have any rights in islam perhaps they see images of muslim women being oppressed in different parts of the muslim world and believe that that is because of their religion
7424737 this perception that women in islam are oppressed is based both on misinformation as well as am amplification of certain unfortunate tendencies in some parts of the muslim world its true that people have seen some muslim authorities using islam as a justification for the oppression or suppression of women thats a reality we cant deny it but we have to balance those incidents with whats going on in the rest of the muslim world in which most women are participating in their societies weve seen that within recent times four muslim majority nations have had female heads of state in most countries that ive traveled to muslim women are involved in all aspects of society muslim women have the same legal rights as muslim men the prophet mohammeds wife was a businesswoman in fact he met her working for her as her agent the legal rights of women were enshrined in islamic law however cultural practices in many societies have prevented those rights from being enforced
7424738 chat participant does the taliban place blame upon women for the weakness of men in their society is that why they place such restriction upon them mattson the taliban place restrictions on everyone in their society men and women theyve extended their authority over individuals far beyond traditional government in afghanistan in their minds they are protecting women from other men by placing these restrictions on them
7424739 that can be frustrating i want to also make sure people understand that although american muslims do have a responsibility to clarify their views on terrorism and violence done in the name of islam we dont have control over these situations we dont have some sort of magic power over all muslims in the world
7424740 right wing christians are very risky allies for american jews mattson said because they the christians are really anti semitic
7424741 the american government has not criticized sufficiently the brutality of the israeli government believing that it needs to be
7424742 mattson has been identified as an extremist by american muslim reformers and moderates
7424743 we see candidates being asked to prove that they comply with an ever narrower definition of what it means to be a christian forget about being a muslim or a jew

7424752 had a certain network not blown our cover at a certain time the text message would have gone out in the morning 8 a m eastern
7424753 we told people they would find out from us when we decided it was going to get out we decided to send the text out
7424754 the most wired hospital isnt necessarily the best decision making organization
7424755 there is a danger in interpreting this survey in a way that suggests that it led to these results what really makes the difference is having an institutional focus on transformation
7424756 hospital executives like this survey because its a good marketing tool
7424757 if there is a weakness in the survey its that we have combined an awards program with a benchmark
7424758 but the survey wouldnt have reached the visibility it has without the awards and ranking aspect the numbers assigned to the hospitals represent the differences between organizations they dont represent anything real and we do use verifications to try to take the gaming out of the responses
7424759 were still going to use a little bit of capacity from our existing plants but we should be able to take substantial engines offline and just devote ourselves to repairing and rehabilitating those engines

7424763 they were very tuned into dark and light going to sleep as darkness fell then awakening hours later to check on the fire check on the babies and make babies
7424764 and then they returned to sleep for a second period
7424765 between 1 and 3 am your liver is very busy making vitamins and hormones eliminating toxins and generally cleansing your body if youre under a lot of stress your body releases a lot of cortisol and for some people this has a stimulating effect as the liver detoxifies
7424766 initially its best to use a kit to detoxify your liver and then if you start to eat foods that are cooling for the liver you should expect to see improvements in your sleep
7424767 light wakes us up and darkness puts us to sleep so make sure your sleep cycle relates to the natural daylight cycle if you engage in vigorous exercise do this earlier in the day in the evening keep your consumption of excitatory foods such as red meat and sweets to a minimum and eat inhibitory foods milk cheese chicken soup bananas and turkey for example
7424768 hold your hands thumb to thumb index finger to index finger and lay them lightly on your belly let your thumbs separate and rise slightly on the inhale and return on the exhale focus your attention on the movement of your hands rising and falling surfing on your belly do this for six or eight breaths and then rest
7424769 as i could say in one of my songs esencia is like a womans second virginity
7424770 its a place one always wants to return to where we hold the most pleasurable memories where we get together with whomever we want and understand what we want to become
7424771 but that isnt the point there is no other place where artists can come and play and have everything set up for them im more convinced than ever that this is truly an important showcase for them
7424772 i get to be up close and personal with writers who have penned some really big songs and you hear those songs and the stories behind them
7424773 its also a great avenue to show new talent ive become aware of writers this way itd be great to have these in other cities
7424774 the gibson showroom is a toy store but for adults
7424775 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego
7424776 we got mouths to feed though gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
7424777 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7424778 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego

7424780 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7424781 why dont you save it in your favorites list and have it available all the time
7424782 its really geared toward the digital audience that wants to be the ultimate decider of what order they watch it
7424783 what it really is is a one stop shop for news fanatics about whats happening right now in the country and the world
7424784 ive been reluctant about a blog not for any other reason that i worry that they become a little self serving and somewhat narcissistic
7424785 ive resisted it in the past im not sure i wont fall into the same trap
7424786 capable of bringing change that will benefit the people regardless of race
7424787 i think its a test of who protects the malay interests the most to which party will they entrust the political future
7424788 what is important to me is to win whether it is by a margin of one or 10 000 it doesnt matter
7424789 we allege the defendant wrongfully enriched himself while he was in the office
7424790 no one seems quite sure how to tackle green issues successfully at this years festival
7424791 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia
7424792 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7424793 concrete ways to implement an agreement reached in may to establish a strategic cooperative partnership
7424794 his rok trip due the very following day after the closing of the beijing olympics will demonstrate ever closer bilateral relations
7424795 at a time when seoul has just experienced the rumpus over us beef friction with tokyo over the claiming of an island and a cooling relationship with pyongyang president hus visit is definitely a big event in lees pragmatic diplomacy
7424796 to make seoul the first stop of the chinese leaders overseas trip after the olympics also reflects the importance china attaches to the rok as a close neighbour a business partner and a member of the six party talks
7424797 in the past weve said a bit naively that if we cater for the needs of plants well just cross our fingers and hope that the needs of animals have been met as well
7424798 we need to be much more refined in our use of fire
7424799 theres a fundamental difference between plants and animals that people often overlook
7424800 for a plant it may not matter diddly squat whether its part of one hectare thats burnt or 10 000 hectares that are burnt
7424801 some may be really helpful to animals some may be detrimental
7424802 if were politically committed to that task we need to be also politically committed to monitoring the impact
7424803 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7424804 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7424805 because there are already drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7424806 the companys claim that they cannot afford to settle the dispute is not credible since they are owned by 40 major financial institution worth billions of pounds
7424807 full contingency arrangements in place to ensure that the usual high standard of security is maintained with minimal disruption for passengers
7424808 we think it forms mercury selenide which is a very stable compound
7424809 you are not supposed to vacuum it up you can distribute the mercury around the house
7424810 its very hard to imaging poisoning an adult with a cfl compact fluorescent light bulb
7424811 professor hurts work is a nice application of nanotechnology to develop a very effective material a nanostructured sorbent for capturing the mercury
7424812 the sorbent itself appears to be much more effective at capturing mercury than other approaches
7424813 its a nice piece of work both as a research study and as a demonstration of a simple technology that can be directly incorporated into a product for the consumer
7424814 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
7424815 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
7424816 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
7424817 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
7424818 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
7424819 its a lot like the shock absorbers on your car
7424820 it isolates the vibrations just travelling through the structure all the way up to the seats of the astronauts
7424821 theres nothing on our risk list that is what i would call a showstopper or a major issue that we cant deal with
7424822 we found the hairs came from sheep and cattle the type of animals herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
7424823 this method could for example be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair such as cashmere wool
7424824 the same often happens with archaeological samples stored under non optimal conditions
7424825 the method is fast can be done within a few hours and is reliable
7424826 we know now that the discoveries on schnidejoch are the oldest of this kind ever made in the alps
7424827 air however is not a great conductor of heat so the further you move away from the earths surface the cooler the air will get
7424828 a general rule of thumb is that the troposphere will cool at a rate of six degrees celsius per 1000 metres in elevation
7424829 if a mountain top is open and exposed it can absorb the suns radiation and re emit it as heat thereby warming the nearby air
7424830 but cover the mountain top in white snow and the suns radiation will be reflected with no heat gain and temperatures will remain frigid
7424831 i am so proud i am so proud the way the community has evolved it is such a matter of pride
7424832 in the 1980s it was very lonesome no indian americans around and hardly anybody from our community attending and you had to tell the people around you where you were from and that i am of indian origin delegate
7424833 but now theres absolutely no problem as far as identity is concerned
7424834 and this time there are so many young indian americans
7424835 the obama delegates are under 40 or less but the hillary clinton delegates anand was elected as a clinton delegate as was chivukula but like all of the clinton delegates are expected to turn over as delegates for obama are over 40
7424836 the increase in numbers has been really dramatic and incredible and this shows that our community has come of age politically
7424837 and he has really attracted a lot of young people from our community
7424838 this cant take away from the fact that we have grown politically as well and gotten involved and now is the process of trying to empower ourselves
7424839 we are here not as indian americans but as part of the larger south asian group and also part of the broader pan asian american movement of the 4 440 delegates and alternates credentialed for the convention 44 per cent represent minority communities african americans asian americans hispanic americans and almost 5 per cent of the delegates are from the asian american community i am so happy because now we are working with pakistani americans bangladeshi americans and with several other community groups and coalitions unlike the old days where we tended to be so clannish and parochial
7424840 the number of south asian american political and community activists who have converged in denver is unprecedented and in addition to working to nominate senator obama as the democratic candidate for president we will also be mobilising our community to get involved with the campaign with the democratic party and with public service in general
7424841 the convention in many ways represents the culmination of safos efforts and the efforts of the organisers and leaders across the country to change our political system as senator obama himself recently acknowledged safo leaders and volunteers have played a critical role in building this historic movement for change
7424842 hypsilophodon had elongated legs and a stiffened counterbalancing tail that suggest it was almost certainly a fast runner
7424843 the plates might have functioned to support the ribcage during fast running
7424844 that as the body of the dead hypsilophodon individual rotted and collapsed the bones from the skin came to be closely associated with the internal bones
7424845 our careful re examination of the specimens shows however that the bony plates are always closely associated with the outside surface of the ribs from the front end of the ribcage and are certainly not armour
7424846 i absolutely agree with their interpretation that these structures are intercostal plates and not dermal armour
7424847 has opened up an exciting new area of research into the plates evolution and function
7424848 has undergone quite a change in appearance since its initial discovery
7424849 it was first imagined to look rather like a large climbing lizard
7424850 an agile terrestrial runner it always seemed odd that a fast runner might retain rows of armour plates
7424851 its a common problem but its not a major problem that cant be overcome with pretty simple adjustments to the set up of their bike
7424852 in the vast majority of the cases you can solve the problem by getting them to readjust their bike and their equipment or use a decent chamois in their bike shorts
7424853 its not appropriate for people who are serious about their cycling they move up and down the seat depending on whether theyre climbing hills sprinting or whether they are cruising you dont just sit in one position on the bike you move around
7424854 the growth in exports is anticipated to moderate in 2009 as further sugar price reduction kicks in at the same time the rate of growth in imports is beginning to rise again imports are projected to grow by 14 8 percent led by higher imports of mineral fuels food machinery amp transport equipment and manufactured goods imports of oil and food are being driven primarily by high international prices of these commodities in dollar terms growth in imports is envisaged to outpace that of exports resulting in a wider trade deficit for 2008 this will continue to exert pressure on the balance of payments
7424855 official foreign reserves at the end of july stood at 887 9 million equivalent to around 3 9 months of imports of goods moreover the mid year inflation stood at 6 9 percent while the year end inflation is currently projected at 7 5 percent
7424856 it is similar to the increase in breast cancer risk of never having had a baby
7424857 its about half the risk of taking three or more glasses of alcohol a day
7424858 there are a lot of scare mongers out there who just beat the drum because they get their money by being a cancer society or they sell alternative medicines
7424859 if your hot flushes are gone your irritability has gone your dry vagina is gone and you think youre coping without it then theres no need to spend 30 a month on hrt
7424860 the current guidelines are that hrt should be used for women with menopausal symptoms for as short a time as possible
7424861 a farm is not like a mine which could have a life of just ten years but pay off its investment in that time we need our farms to be viable for generations to come
7424862 we have just 12 000 hectares here which is the area of one cotton farm in the eastern states
7424863 it hasnt rained here for months and the lake is still overflowing
7424864 we use less than three per cent of the water in lake argyle any irrigation system has the potential to be over allocated but we are so far from over allocation that its not funny
7424865 some of the issues revolve around salinity when you irrigate you need to think about your salt management or you pay heavily down the line you have to really understand your catchment and we havent done a good job in the past with our monitoring systems
7424866 we have in the past gone into the landscape without fully knowing its hydrogeology now we have the technology and the engineering to make sure the full life cycle of irrigation is planned and managed well
7424867 theres this general feeling that with rivers like the ord theres a lot of water around doing nothing but the water in those catchments is sustaining ecosystems the catchments look and behave the way they do because of how much water there is and how it is used
7424868 we have to be very careful about how we nurture northern australia so lets be cautious lets under allocate as we have seen with the murray darling once you over allocate its very difficult to repair the damage
7424869 its a precious environment on a world scale we should be protecting it instead of looking at it as another resource to be exploited
7424870 after lake argyle the ord became a completely different river
7424871 it used to flood seasonally over a very wide plain which replenished wetlands and ensured revegetation through seed dispersal it is also impacting marine life with the dam being a barrier to fish migrating upstream
7424872 we believe that further research will show what we already know that the environmental costs just do not stack up

7424908 this brings relief to those who are faced with distress and undue hardship we hope the measures will make a difference in the lives of poor people who are battling during these hard times where the cost of living has increased as a result of high food and petrol prices
7424909 the lack of adjustment of the means test to make it in line with inflation had diminished the value of the grants more especially in purchasing the basket of goods and services that is mostly consumed by the poor

7424914 im looking forward to getting a nice house when the time comes
7424915 education is a companion which no future can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave
7424916 in order to achieve these objectives which are central to the success of the country as a non racial and non sexist democracy we need heroes and heroines whose sacrifices would communicate the message that what we seek to achieve is practically realisable provided that at all times and in all circumstances we will remain loyal to principle
7424917 we are meeting here today to celebrate raymond mhlaba because of what he did during six long decades to help the black oppressed of our country to sustain their sense of identity and continuity
7424918 raymond mhlaba was and is one of our outstanding national heroes his sacrifices constitute an integral part of the ethos which determines the sense and definition of the national identity
7424919 we must therefore project and actively market our national heroes and heroines such as raymond mhlaba
7424920 we must use the example set by our national heroes and heroines to establish a popularly accepted platform a uniting vision which the nation would use to propel the country towards the achievement of the humane goals spelt out in our national constitution and the constitutive act of the african union
7424921 when someone is representing fort hays state university they have a special duty and your behavior speaks to your institution as well

7424960 like infants scream for moms milk you should be screaming for gods truth
7424961 it was he who gave some to be apostles some to be prophets some to be evangelists and some to be pastors and teachers to prepare gods people for works of service so that the body of christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the son of god and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of christ

7424990 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there
7424991 his performance during this years trade deadline became its own tribe in brazil
7424992 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer

7425005 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith and this convention will demonstrate that in an unprecedented way
7425006 as convention ceo and a pastor myself i am incredibly proud that so many esteemed leaders from the faith community will be with us to celebrate this historic occasion and honor the diverse faith traditions inside the democratic party
7425007 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7425008 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7425009 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7425010 if we can reduce unwanted pregnancies then its much less likely that people resort to abortion the way to do that is to encourage young people and older people people of child bearing years to act responsibly
7425011 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7425012 there still is a possibility that obama will chip into the republican advantage with this religious outreach
7425013 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election

7425152 in the fifties jazz was the exciting music of the moment charlie parker miles mjq gerry mulligan but for me that which i could identify with most was the influence of arab and african music and culture in black american music the move toward a separate cultural identity away from the white trash rectangular music it started with the substituting of christian names by muslim ones there was ahmed abdul malek on the oud with his jazz sahara music and there was yusef lateef experimenting with flutes reeds bottles balloons home made string instruments and the use of fake arab words i would spend hours in paris and harlem looking for his records heres another reverse example instead of a record album using my painting i use an album cover photo for my painting when the painting was completed i sent yusef a photo of it and signed it with abdul mati klarwein he replied promptly with a dear bro letter saying he would use it as soon as he could for an album cover six months later i found myself in n y listening to him play at the five spot during a break i went over to his table and introduced myself he looked at me with disdain and hardly greeted me when i told him i was the artist who did the painting he sneered and turned his back to me resuming his conversation with a friend i forgot that love between colors is not always mutual

7425162 there seems to be some surprise expressed over the fact that miss aurora dangelo who led a mob of demonstrators in a riot over the sacco vanzetti case in chicago passed the mentality tests of psychiatrists with flying colours there is no reason for supposing that the intellect of those who lead movements opposed to the theories that govern society of today is defective if they are regarded as being warped in their judgements that is chiefly due to the fact that their ideas differ profoundly from those of the majority it does not imply that they have less mental ability than the average it is possible that these people have allowed their emotions to assume control of their minds rather than their reason and that they are therefore prevented in certain cases in which their emotional nature is mainly involved to pronounce as well balanced a decision as they might otherwise do but it must be remembered that mankind is largely made up of emotional creatures and these are not to be classed as subnormal in the famous case of eddie sidis who was trained from babyhood by his father the well known psychologist and possessed and twelve or more actual learning than the average man has at thirty all this brilliant achievement in the way of early education did not prevent him from being arrested while making a revolutionary speech to a mob of red agitators had young sidis possessed a subnormal intelligence his fathers experimental education must have failed eddie sidis and aurora dangelo were both 18 years old when arrested as disorderly rioters youth is the time when emotion has the ruling place in most human mentalities it is not often that the wild enthusiasm of youth are carried unimpaired into the maturity of middle and old age but the world would be a dull place if the young people did not have their occasional outbursts it would be very satisfying to those who feel that the only path to safety is that of extreme conservatism if they could pronounce all agitators to be defective in mind and have them placed under lock and key but a glance over even recent history goes to show that the revolutionary thinker of today is likely to be the conservative of tomorrow or the next day and that the progress of humanity is largely due to those who have differed from their fellows and who have been persecuted for their ideas the youthful anarchist will probably become the middle aged constitutionlist and at any rate no case can be made out against such persons on the ground of defective mental powers

7425312 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7425313 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter

7425325 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7425326 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7425327 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7425328 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to

7425345 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7425346 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7425347 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7425348 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7425349 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7425350 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7425351 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7425352 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into

7425356 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7425357 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted

7425383 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7425384 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7425385 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7425386 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7425387 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7425388 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7425389 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7425390 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
7425391 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
7425392 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7425393 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7425394 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7425395 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7425396 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7425397 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7425398 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7425399 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7425400 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7425401 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7425402 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7425403 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7425404 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
7425405 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7425406 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7425407 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7425408 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7425409 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7425410 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7425411 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7425412 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7425413 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7425414 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7425415 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7425416 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7425417 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7425418 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7425419 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7425420 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7425421 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7425422 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7425423 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7425424 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7425425 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands

7425431 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7425432 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7425433 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7425434 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7425435 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7425436 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7425437 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7425438 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7425439 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7425440 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7425441 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7425442 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7425443 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7425444 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7425445 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7425446 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7425447 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7425448 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7425449 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7425450 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7425451 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7425452 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7425453 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7425454 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7425455 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7425456 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7425457 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7425458 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7425459 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7425460 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7425461 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7425462 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7425463 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7425464 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7425465 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7425466 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7425467 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7425468 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7425469 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7425470 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7425471 im sorry about that but you really need to do a better job informing me of what you do and what kind of cases you want because i dont know
7425472 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7425473 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7425474 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7425475 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7425476 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7425477 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7425478 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7425479 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7425480 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7425481 the bill permits the board of game to allow a predator program for wolves and grizzly bears if the commissioner of fish and game finds an emergency where wolves or grizzly bears in an area are causing a decline in prey
7425482 i would as soon see all of the management stop save the money and let nature take its course
7425483 alaskans helping deluded individuals who think they are using wry humor to make social commentary
7425484 first the wolf pack finds the weakest easiest target in the herd usually the young aged or injured
7425485 wolves have already been reintroduced to yellowstone the fact that people will eventually die as a result is seen as irrelevant by the groups responsible
7425486 terminating these animals means keeping the numbers of wildlife herds at a level we can hunt and eat for years to come
7425487 and we all know where that money will come from the pockets of hunters trappers and fishermen
7425488 what lost said was 12 01 am we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7425489 we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7425490 if any of you are capable of killing whatever youre hunting this year in the same manner as a wolf then you might have some real prowess
7425491 spontaneous cheers will interrupt the convention secretary in mid sentence and at 10 33 the president will be nominated and there will be a ten minute spontaneous demonstration with balloons
7425492 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7425493 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7425494 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7425495 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7425496 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7425497 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7425498 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7425499 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7425500 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7425501 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7425502 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7425503 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7425504 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7425505 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7425506 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7425507 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7425508 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7425509 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7425510 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7425511 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7425512 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7425513 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7425514 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7425515 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7425516 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7425517 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7425518 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7425519 leave the last piece of dim sum so itll get cold but no one can actually eat it
7425520 that definitely put pressure on them and changed the inning
7425521 when hes swinging good he hits the ball as hard as anybody
7425522 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7425523 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7425524 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7425525 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7425526 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7425527 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7425528 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7425529 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7425530 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7425531 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7425532 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7425533 its jonathans decision but the answer is yes more than no
7425534 i dont know to be honest but i suspect he will still be here
7425535 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7425536 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7425537 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7425538 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7425539 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7425540 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7425541 this institution has significant funding as do the other institutions both here in canberra and also around australia
7425542 the decisions that are made by the institution are made by the board and by the executives
7425543 they are the ones who have to decide what priorities they are going to set where they are going to apply their resources
7425544 so there is no need to be drastic in macroeconomic control in the second half of the year
7425545 i appeal to you to vote for my husband my husband was put in jail for six years at that time my children were small
7425546 they said my husband had committed a heinous crime but when my children asked me why their father had been put in jail i told them it was because he wants to help the less fortunate
7425547 after 10 years anwar wants to contest and they come up with a similar allegations i urge you not to believe this it is a slander
7425548 i appeal to you to vote for anwar we need to continue our struggle we are victims of the barisan nasional this government is corrupt and evil
7425549 we have been receiving messages of condolence from members since the announcement and our close knit profession feels bens loss very deeply
7425550 life has been extremely difficult for them clinic staff since the crisis began and to have this happen on top of all theyve had to deal with will be devastating
7425551 its a coincidence the quarantine is lifted on the day of bens memorial service
7425552 ben loved his career and horses it was a major part of his life and i know he would overjoyed to finally have the ban lifted its just devastating that he cant be here
7425553 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7425554 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7425555 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7425556 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused
7425557 give the economy some breathing room following a slowdown after monetary tightening the report said adding that the ministry of finance is to work out the plans details
7425558 and to be sitting in front you guys tonight and be on top of the world
7425559 i think we did a hell of a job putting america basketball back where its supposed to be
7425560 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals what you saw today was a team bonded together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7425561 i think this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7425562 these players have given of themselves for three years theyve given up their summers theyve bought into the whole team thing they set their personal egos aside theyve done everything asked of them
7425563 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned

7425604 they said my husband had committed a heinous crime but when my children asked me why their father had been put in jail i told them it was because he wants to help the less fortunate

7425607 the teacher who is currently suspended from school and doing clerical work in the selangor education department has been undergoing two week counselling
7425608 she has been reprimanded and given a stern warning the teacher has promised that the incident will not recur
7425609 this is not true it was not a promotion the shift was only a temporary one we view the case very seriously although the parents of the students involved accepted the teachers apology the case had spread widely among the indian community
7425610 a school is a place to instil racial harmony and mutual understanding it shouldnt be used as a zone to quarrel the ministry is constantly monitoring for such situations which will lead to misunderstandings and racial insensitivities

7425614 life has been extremely difficult for them clinic staff since the crisis began and to have this happen on top of all theyve had to deal with will be devastating
7425615 its a coincidence the quarantine is lifted on the day of bens memorial service
7425616 ben loved his career and horses it was a major part of his life and i know he would overjoyed to finally have the ban lifted its just devastating that he cant be here
7425617 but we warn horse owners to be aware of the potential signs and to notify us if there are any

7425619 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7425620 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7425621 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation

7425625 the decisions that are made by the institution are made by the board and by the executives
7425626 they are the ones who have to decide what priorities they are going to set where they are going to apply their resources
7425627 we are committed to making sure that these institutions are adequately resourced that they do the very good job into the future that theyve done in the past
7425628 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7425629 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7425630 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7425631 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused

7425664 of all the ways in which we tried to game out what rock bottom would look like even we would not have anticipated that two septuagenarians would be sentenced to re education through labor while the games were going on
7425665 the chinese government continues to give us an endless stream of material to work with and has an incredible tin ear
7425666 behind all of the pomp and glitter an untold number of chinese citizens are now languishing in labor camps prisons or simply missing as a result of these games
7425667 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7425668 the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7425669 people walking on the street are so happy so optimistic about their own tomorrow the athletes are happy about their performance about the competition about everything they see
7425670 there is one narrative that is the accepted narrative if you are on board with that narrative you can fully enjoy the games you can get excited by the chinese gold medals you can be part of this national project
7425671 if you question it in any way you are on the side of the enemies of the chinese state and you had better look out
7425672 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7425673 i dont think it the london games will be on the same level as china because theyve got such big resources but london will put on an equally good show
7425674 post olympics china is slowing not because the olympics are over but because of global forces
7425675 chinas macro statistics are going to look terrible the rest of this year and into 2009 china wants to act and supporting the growth rate is going to be overwhelmingly the top policy priority
7425676 our view is that the administration has a number of levers they can pull in the attempt to keep growth around 10 percent in the second half and into next year
7425677 in terms of economic growth it doesnt have any impact
7425678 were going down from stupidly fast last year to really fast this year and just plain ordinary fast next year which would be in the 8 9 percent range
7425679 its a big downshift and that may create some problems but theyll still be growing faster than any other major economy in the world
7425680 leading into beijing everyone was talking about the politics but i think once people got here they really focused on the sports
7425681 that is president hu jintaos style just let things go on
7425682 these games needed to go well to help china feel confident internationally the leaders will be thrilled
7425683 nobodys died nobodys been collapsing because of the air and the people who turned up in the airport with masks on they just looked stupid
7425684 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
7425685 china was authoritarian on the way into the games and it will be authoritarian on the way out
7425686 demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system in concentrating energies to accomplish grand feats
7425687 the government has used the olympics to display its organizing strength and win over the public with a new kind of self confident nationalism
7425688 perhaps western powers should expect fewer rather than more concessions from china
7425689 the chinese nations olympic dream has always been bound to its course of national revival
7425690 the beijing olympic games have added impetus for national self confidence
7425691 ordinary people will now have a stronger sense that their country really is a rising power
7425692 gold medals dont say everything because chinas sports are state backed but after all to win so many gold medals shouldnt be slighted as a sign of rising prosperity and power
7425693 sports are just sports but this success will intensify foreign fears that china is becoming a successful authoritarian government confident in itself that can chart its own course
7425694 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7425695 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games which includes a final propaganda push to legitimize chinas rule in tibet with tibetans singing and dancing along with other so called ethnic minorities
7425696 for the first time in my life i feel compelled to stand up and speak for the man who i believe has a new vision for america

7425702 it just doesnt make sense to try and get college students to want your product by using a comedian that their parents love it is just like microsoft to attempt to copy mac in everything they do but instead they make a pile of steaming trash

7425707 my task was only to hear the oath and i had no part in the drafting of the oath which saiful made it is also unimportant for me so specify who
7425708 i also wish to deny that i received any money to witness the swearing i was only acting on instructions
7425709 during the swearing saiful mis pronounced one of the islamic words because he had it written down in malay instead of arabic
7425710 saiful also made a mistake on when anwar ibrahim had allegedly inserted his penis into his rectum
7425711 instead of june 26 saiful said he was sodomised on aug 26 before correcting himself
7425712 i only joined umno because of a friend and since i dont hold any positions in the party ive nothing to be afraid of
7425713 im not active even and i can be said to be a fake member
7425714 many people would call or even text me on sms short messaging system to scold me and accuse me of not being a legitimate imam
7425715 although im not the imam besar im a real imam
7425716 i also want to make known that i am not an ulama nor the imam besar as what some reports have said
7425717 for me it is as it was done on the eve of nomination day
7425718 when the attacks began no one defended me but im thankful that pkr has invited me to state my case
7425719 he came to see me here in permatang pauh and told me who he was he said he was a witness at saifuls swearing ceremony
7425720 i was surprised and asked him what he wanted to which he said he had to tell the truth

7425725 the story here is more the obama not clinton ticket
7425726 to put yourself through what is a pretty rigorous process of running for president youve got to have learned to set up some pretty high expectations for got to be driving you and in my case if you have somebody that is absent maybe you feel like youve got something to prove when youre young and that pattern sets itself up over time
7425727 the stories i heard about my father painted him as larger than life which also meant that i felt i had something to live up to you could argue that if youre too well adjusted you dont end up running for president so if the pattern sets in pretty early on where youre pushing your comfort level it probably has to do with those very early influences and that can come from either the absence or the presence of a father who ends up motivating you in some way
7425728 he seemed to be real proud right at his side kind of holding on to his dads arm

7425737 ordered to desist from communicating his views on this subject in newspapers by email on the radio in public speeches or on the internet so long as he should live he has been ordered to pay compensation to
7425738 further to make a public recantation of beliefs he still holds
7425739 there should be an opportunity for students to be educated about alcohol and right now we cant do it in good conscience we have to tell students that its illegal to drink but if you are going to drink this is how you should do it that is a mix message to send students
7425740 the 21 year old age limit does not prevent binge drinking it happens in campuses across the country and i think if we were able to show responsible drinking and modeled responsible drinking and we educate students about it would be very beneficial for everybody
7425741 i support this initiative because it will allow our colleges to engage in real education of our students about responsible use of alcohol as well as model moderate behavior at present we are constrained only to talk about abstinence since anything else is against the law treating college students as adults will help them to make more responsible decisions
7425742 speakers like bill clinton and justice antonin scalia dropped by last spring and neither was tarred and feathered

7425746 a college with which i am affiliated discovered that its alma mater was written for a blackface minstrel show in the 1900s although the lyrics are innocuous the school banned the song from this years graduation and formed a group to discuss its future use part of a campaign to make students aware of things they take for granted is this a good response or should the school focus on more important issues is it unethical to sing the song
7425747 the schools response is not only ethical but also admirable

7425753 illusion that danger may be abolished through successful diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces
7425754 the split is a much profounder and more alienating one
7425755 thus we already have three worlds undoubtedly however the number is even greater we are just too far away to see
7425756 vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day western systems
7425757 may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civic courage
7425758 technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment
7425759 is only a question of the good organization of the state the problem of organizing a state however hard it may seem can be solved even for a race of devils
7425760 ambition must be made to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place
7425761 policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests the defect of better motives
7425762 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
7425763 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
7425764 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent in human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
7425765 everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature are left outside the range of attention of the state and the social system
7425766 the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
7425767 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
7425768 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey
7425769 on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but he have lost the concept of a supreme compete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
7425770 the split in the world is less terrible than the fact that the same disease plagues its two main sections
7425771 it is imperative to review the table of widespread human values
7425772 intolerable despotic repression of mans physical nature in favor of the spiritual one
7425773 we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
7425774 just because i am a friend to i dare to say these things about democracy
7425775 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
7425776 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
7425777 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
7425778 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
7425779 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
7425780 it was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads
7425781 at first truman was almost alone in thinking that an airlift would work as an effective response to the soviets
7425782 trailblazer in pursuit of oil the re opening of azerbaijan to the west
7425783 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
7425784 so how come at freshmen orientation they taught us about petty worries like stds and alcohol but not how to survive real peril namely earthquakes
7425785 theres nothing in any of these data that would suggest that girls cant do math or arent doing well in math
7425786 age 41 he mathematically could be the grandson of a perpetrator of the armenian genocide instead hes armed with rhetorical skills a smile and turkish government talking points and propaganda
7425787 the role and challenges of turkey in a globalizing world
7425788 he initially said some of the students were being harassed
7425789 i asked you to voluntarily remove your video from youtube because you had no authority to publish it i explained that you needed to obtain for starters the students consent before doing so
7425790 as a result of a third party notification by claremont graduate university claiming that this material is infringing
7425791 i dont see any legal basis to request student faces to be blurred based on the facts as i understand them
7425792 the web site i paid for it to be up for a year
7425793 i didnt want all the art to pile up on me
7425794 the knowledge of individuals taken as a whole is far greater than that of any commission or board however diligent and expert the magic of the system of prices and of economic markets is that they incorporate a great deal of diffuse knowledge
7425795 a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action
7425796 it looks as if hes done far better than just passing
7425797 if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
7425798 i didnt take it lightly that a high priced lawyer who has represented celebrities like cameron diaz and lou rawls was hired by officials at a university with unlimited spending power to make my life miserable i had no idea to what lengths claremont graduate university would go to jerk around a little guy exercising his first amendment rights
7425799 claremont officials had enough appreciation for free speech to allow an armenian genocide denier to speak as an honored guest at their university but when it came to news coverage of the event which is protected by the untied states constitution they seemingly concocted a reason to squash free speech i can only assume the phone call from a lawyer was a not too subtle effort to shut me up
7425800 save their web favorites online share them with others see what other technical pros are favoriting and connecting with others
7425801 the only way the bookmarks here would be useful for me would be to consolidate the bookmarks in one place either all in delicious or all in msdn forums
7425802 now the real question for anyone using sharepoint in their enterprise which means a lot of people is when can we have this functionality integrated to our sharepoint server
7425803 obviously we couldnt care less aboutyet another delicious product unless it offers something we can use in the enterprise any idea
7425804 woody the cowboy and his toy box friends are dumped in a day care center after their owner andy leaves for college
7425805 they were talking about who they were going to set on fire we never had stunt men or anything like that they were basically talking about one of the executive producers doing it so i went look ill do it and they went what i said larry ill do this for you and larry says vin i wouldnt do this for me
7425806 if my manager agent or insurance people knew they wouldnt have let us do it so i said well dont say nothing nice and quiet went out there filmed it they set light to me then they said weve got to do it again the first one he lit throws the lighter down and the lighter goes out and hits me straight in the nuts we had three goes at it
7425807 post olympics china at least in the first one or two years will be marked with triumphant glory and renewed ambition
7425808 i dont say that it will be a rallying point but it certainly will keep alive foreign press interest in china
7425809 the olympics was a driving force to push china forward but it is still within the scope of our existing development system
7425810 the olympics are just a small episode in chinas development
7425811 the country will see more progress and better living standards thats what i am expecting
7425812 after the olympic games the chinese governments credibility prestige and authority will reach the highest point ever
7425813 we used to have a very sad nationalism because we struggled through a lot of humiliation and setbacks during the last 100 years
7425814 and that is not healthy because it has made us unconfident and overly sensitive the olympic games shows that china has already been accepted and acknowledged internationally chinese peoples confidence is boosted and our nationalism has become more optimistic healthy and mature
7425815 the goal of the ccp internationally is to establish china as a great power at least the equal of the us
7425816 so far the party should feel that the beijing games from the facilities to the chinese teams performance have succeeded in moving china ahead in its preferred direction
7425817 through the olympic mirror china certainly saw a strong proud and magnificent image of itself
7425818 this image will bury a long endured painful memory in my view the collective sentiment of post olympics chinese will be more redeemed more relaxed and thus more normal
7425819 the reason why the party has not been willing to give its people more freedom is that they are not confident enough
7425820 as the governments confidence was boosted by the olympics i hope it will endow more freedom to its people
7425821 what the party has learned is that it didnt have to open up to have a successful olympics
7425822 its had some criticism in the foreign press but chinese people arent reading that the party have been able to use technical means to better manage dissent and to more actively create a public opinion that supports the status quo leaving the ccp in a very strong position
7425823 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7425824 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7425825 joe biden believes the war was a mistake mccain would still do it all over again biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden
7425826 john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today

7425837 indian team was worried when jayawrdene and thushara were scoring runs
7425838 having a fifth bowler is a luxury we have to make do with four bowlers but we have bowlers like yuvraj raina and virat who can bowl we needed one extra batsman
7425839 earlier india had batsmen who could play till the end and i could go for big shots early i am however happy that i still have strike rate of 90 though i would have been happier to have a strike rate of over hundred
7425840 when you are scoring centuries you dont ask these questions every batsman has highs and lows the idea of playing sangakkara as opener is to have some senior batsman to get more balls to play

7425843 i think dhoni did a very good job in the last two matches after his teammates were made to struggle on tricky wickets in the second odi he along with badrinath consolidated his team s position at dambulla while yesterday he and suresh raina put up a reasonable total for their bowlers to defend
7425844 i think the indian team has exposed the lack of solidity in sri lankan batting in the last two matches

7425901 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009 the icc said in a statement
7425902 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location the statement said
7425903 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7425904 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7425905 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled said lorgat who took over last month
7425906 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7425907 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7425908 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7425909 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters he said
7425910 i consider fear and loathing in las vegas to be comfort reading i like the al pastor tacos at tacos mexico and i count among my literary influences the chainsaw from doom
7425911 we regard it as very unfortunate indeed that this claim has been brought
7425912 mrs harris was clearly a calm and sensitive lady who she told us placed great store on integrity and family values
7425913 we cannot find any evidence whatsoever to support her ms austins assertion that kim harris had victimised or harassed her the claimants evidence against kim harris was so unreliably given we unhappily can place no regard upon it whatsoever
7425914 light pollution is a major issue in our region and if we want there to be any dark sky in the area we need sites like the new racecourse to take a much more considered approach to large scale lighting
7425915 please try to make a difference and let the council be aware of the problem it only takes a few minutes to send out an email

7425921 the residents of lowestoft including waveney district council and many local businesses have been vocal in expressing their wish to remain in suffolk we strongly support them in this we have been working closely with waveney district council and i would like to pay personal tribute to the very positive role played by waveneys leader mark bee

7425947 it was considered but dismissed very rapidly quite simply because there was no longer sufficient lead time to relocate the event in the same time frame

7425962 now were the ones who have to subsidise fuel for the company
7425963 obviously with the rising consumer prices that followed the fuel price hike people who were in the near poor category have become poor
7425964 we expect it to happen two or three months after the fuel price hike but after that the level will be normal again
7425965 everything has become more expensive including cooking oil and flour
7425966 whoever the president is is the same little people like us will always suffer
7425967 that has now come down to 81 9c which is a reduction of 15 4c
7425968 to cut to the chase on tuesday the average price for that same period had fallen by 15c to an average of 144 4c
7425969 for motorists it is very confusing and if they are still seeing prices up around 162c they are upset the prices arent coming down
7425970 it is extremely difficult and that is the benefit of fuelwatch
7425971 there was a 27c per litre range in sydney yesterday some petrol retailers may not pass on the reductions in wholesale prices as quickly as others
7425972 those particular retailers are outed using the fuelwatch system at the moment they keep prices higher until someone is cheaper
7425973 we will probably see prices down below 1 30 soon and over this coming week well see the national average price down to 1 25
7425974 it is starting to work its way down theres should be another 5c to 10c of savings coming for motorists to enjoy
7425975 we have a watchdog that has bark but no bite
7425976 we hope his replacement is going to be aggressive and pursue oil companies to look after motorists interests
7425977 i filled up on saturday in parramatta and it was 1 36 compared with anything ive seen around it was cheap as chips i travel everywhere and it is much cheaper to fill up further away from the city in campbelltown and places like that it is much cheaper
7425978 over the long run fuel prices do have an effect a longer term process of adaption is set off
7425979 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run
7425980 you either fight it or learn to love it i love it

7426011 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
7426012 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military
7426013 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran

7426028 and the stories that have been spun around them are absolutely wrong

7426033 it is agreed that no part of the above mentioned remuneration will be transferred to a french citizen or to any company directly or indirectly controlled by french individuals or companies or to any beneficiary of a resident or nonresident bank account in france
7426034 should we receive within six months of today a contract for inspection and price verification of goods imported into pakistan
7426035 we will pay you 6 percent of the total amount invoiced and paid to the government of pakistan for such a contract and during the whole duration of that contract and its renewal

7426037 somebody in the bank has cooperated with my enemies to make false documents
7426038 we made a mantra out of the phrase good governance

7426076 yes do it buy yourself coq10 a minimum of 300 mg s per caspsule softgel and just do it buy two bottles do it for six days in a row
7426077 the thing i hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright creative and ambitious young people leaving us mainly with the slow and self obsessed to become our artists modern art is a disaster area never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little
7426078 they sit right by the wire so they can get in the picture when i win
7426079 mckenna is always yelling lets go daddy i can hear her at the finish line
7426080 hes the best three furlong horse that ive ever trained hes the best three furlong horse that c a carruthers of butte ever owned and the best three furlong horse that ever hit this state i think
7426081 were in their first win picture at three weeks old in miles city
7426082 i had them and three weeks later we hit the race track
7426083 theyve just traveled ever since they dont even like being home
7426084 helps every morning at the stalls shes at the barn at six oclock
7426085 this will probably be their last weekend though because school is starting
7426086 ill be without them for the rest of the race season
7426087 im not 100 percent so its probably best that i take off today mend and come back and do well next weekend
7426088 he broke on top and ran a hell of a race
7426089 it has led to better quality of care and more preventive medicine
7426090 in the private sector you wont get buy in from a private doctors office in town to integrate with some other hospital
7426091 we have an advantage in that were the va were a closed health care system
7426092 we have cut our medication errors almost to nothing as a result
7426093 as were finishing prescriptions we have access to the doctors notes the lab results so we can do a better job of assessing whether this drug is appropriate for the patient and whether the dose is right
7426094 you go into the va pharmacy and say i forgot my blood pressure pills can you get me a two week supply
7426095 they look it up and the say ok i see that youre on that medication let me get it for you
7426096 if we would have asked physicians about this when we first brought it up 11 years ago they would have said get rid of this thing i want to do it the way ive been doing it
7426097 you go around and ask them today what if we got rid of this thing and went back to paper
7426098 we want to make sure that electronic systems can talk to each other for the benefit of health care consumers in montana
7426099 we believe that it will cut costs and increase efficiency
7426100 the advantage is that you have a total picture of a patient wherever they show up for whatever treatment at any time
7426101 we can pull patient medical data from anywhere at any time
7426102 you do what any good young politician does you shake hands and meet lots of people
7426103 its important in a candidate not only to mirror your values but be someone you know will be a strong advocate for them
7426104 im not convinced that john mccains short term tax cuts are the answer for me and my friends to come back to montana
7426105 but when you came out it was a good feeling it made you feel comfortable that theyre trying to do everything they can for you
7426106 we set up all the consults so that everything is in place when they get home
7426107 if theyre not making appointments we call and ask if its a good fit for the provider
7426108 it not we find another one its a pretty tight run ship
7426109 i thought it was outstanding care they have very experienced doctors and nursing staff
7426110 when i went away i felt like i was covered
7426111 and thats really low ball because pricing varies so much
7426112 i might be able to find t shirts for 5 but maybe not
7426113 customers are watching the ads very closely and theyre looking for bargains

7426143 the troy police department has long enjoyed the support of area
7426144 i would call my dream birthday party soco biggest bash
7426145 everyone involved in this project wants to see it as a great environmental success story and hopefully it will be in the longer term but there are some short term negatives that are being glossed over
7426146 but id be cautious because these are potentially very toxic concentrations were seeing
7426147 i certainly dont believe anyone is trying to cover up things but i think people really underestimated the complexity of this river system
7426148 epa can no longer ignore the overwhelming evidence of uncontrolled release of hazardous substances
7426149 pplm demands that epa undertake immediate actions to limit the risk of erosion of significant amounts of impacted sediments from the milltown site
7426150 my overall impression of the removal to date is that the well intentioned desire to do something out stripped some very real cautions offered by knowledgeable scientists
7426151 whether there will be long term negative consequences from the removal and its aftermath remain to be seen
7426152 a relatively simple model was applied to a very complex problem but the first time i walked that upper reservoir area it was obvious to me that the sediment there was highly mobile and a lot of it would be scoured once the dam was breached
7426153 with regard to personnel strength where theyre coming from were just not giving out numbers because of security issues
7426154 i think every time the cheyenne police department has requested an outside agency assist us even agencies from colorado they have been there immediately to assist with that request
7426155 i think that our agency will complement them very well
7426156 when im on the team im trying very much so to be a member of the team period not so much as a chief of police but as a mounted unit officer
7426157 were prepared for everything up to riots and if any kind of gases are deployed
7426158 but were hoping that its more of a presence a be known type of situation where there is no riotous conduct
7426159 to me it seems like the good want to be good and the bad just want to get their names in the headlines
7426160 its a helpful tool thats not intended to be intimidating
7426161 its just a sheer size and presence that benefits in an awful lot of operations
7426162 we need to get these people out of their rooms and stop feeling sorry for themselves
7426163 go die on the golf course id rather die doing something i love than sitting at home feeling sorry for myself
7426164 i remember being in my 30s and picking up a coffee cup and my hand would shake and i would think whats going on
7426165 i have to tell you something else you also have parkinsons
7426166 a feeling of anxiety a feeling of worthlessness a feeling of futility those things can consume you if you let them
7426167 i try to get up every morning and give someone a doughnut give someone a smile
7426168 all we have is right now we can hope for the future but all we have is right now
7426169 i dont say that from an egocentric point of view i say it from the point of view of someone who is parkinsons afflicted who is amazed at what he did
7426170 i want to get this organization started before i die before i get incapacitated
7426171 with my parkinsons ive had a lot of meltdowns and ive lost of lot of sleep
7426172 you cant delegate whats in your soul now after keeping copious notes i can begin to delegate
7426173 my doctor says why do you keep tying your shoes
7426174 i found that all through my life what meant the most to me was my parents my wife my children my grandchildren
7426175 one person even one disabled person can change the lives of people can change the world
7426176 all they need is a smile all they need is support
7426177 100 percent committed to protecting your right to keep and bear arms
7426178 it is no surprise that they would use karl rove style tactics to distort obamas record and try to scare voters
7426179 when gun owners get past the fear tactics and realize they have nothing to fear from barack obama they quickly understand that obama is the candidate who will preserve the hunting and fishing traditions of montana by protecting and expanding access to public lands
7426180 an f means you have to take the course over
7426181 and the nra definitely means something in montana theyre pretty good at the ground game stuff with e mails to their members and mass mailings
7426182 they want someone who speaks out and is clear on the issues
7426183 to make the race all about guns demonstrates that tim fox doesnt even understand the office that hes running for
7426184 i dont know any montanan who wants to take away our guns
7426185 its a visceral kind of issue because people tend to feel so strongly about it here
7426186 we try very hard to be nonpartisan but it is difficult to find democrats as enthusiastic about the right to bear arms as most republicans are
7426187 the thing i hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright creative and ambitious young people leaving us mainly with the slow and self obsessed to become our artists modern art is a disaster area never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little
7426188 try to scare the heck out of you about the democratic nominee
7426189 i think youll conclude that hes sort of like us he comes form a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans
7426190 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7426191 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7426192 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june

7426197 back in january it was reported that the youngest planet ever to be discovered about ten times the mass of jupiter was orbiting the eight to ten million year old star tw hydrae now a spanish research team has concluded that tw hydrae b doesnt exist and that cold spots on the stars surface actually produced the dip in brightness instead of a transiting planet not as cool as if a planet had actually been there but refutations are science too right
7426198 i am pleased with this decision bail i will proceed with my campaign
7426199 there is a risk that the political situation in malaysia deteriorates significantly in the coming weeks

7426237 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox but if the giants really want him they have a shot its not out of the question
7426238 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7426239 im sure michael is happy with fox but he obviously loves the giants too
7426240 if theyre interested in talking to him hed discuss it with them but right now as i see it youll be watching him on fox this year

7426242 nobody was critical of any religion what people spoke about was the effect of a spouse or parent who converted and then they were left abandoned
7426243 i can consider myself a staunch muslim as well the bar council has never taken any stand that is anti islam the bar council has never taken any position against any racial religious ideology and so on the bar council is free from all this
7426244 i totally disagree with the stand taken by zulkifli everybody knows what the bar council is about
7426245 its completely unjustified she is not racist at all his statement is no different from umno i would have expected such an outburst from an umno member but not a pkr member

7426247 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7426248 the mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of myra hindley was shown in a short video at london house and asked that it not be shown again
7426249 british art definitely represents some of the best of british but of all the many masterpieces that could could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice
7426250 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7426251 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time yet
7426252 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels
7426253 this is a wonderful day of course for the satmar community which is largely represented by these new registrations but also for the greater williamsburg jewish community
7426254 this includes the kehillos of pupa klausenberg skver vishnitz viener and others who are all empowered by participating in this voter registration drive spearheaded by the ujo this is a great show of our united strength and that strength is what brings resources to our communities
7426255 this is tremendous day for all brooklyn communities in these tough economic times when resources are getting more and more scarce it is important for brooklyn to flex its muscles and show just by its sheer size alone that is has incredible strength in its communities this is a very great accomplishment for rabbi niederman ujo and the new voters who have just empowered themselves
7426256 3 000 to 4 000 votes in a democratic primary
7426257 the kind of enthusiasm that i have seen from the younger generation to get out the vote has not been seen in the last 20 years
7426258 candidates and elected officials will be surprised at the number of voters come election time
7426259 they the younger generation are the driving force behind this registration campaign they realize maybe for the first time that they hold their future in their hands their vote counts their vote makes a difference
7426260 the stakes of this election will be made very clear

7426266 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7426267 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7426268 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7426269 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7426270 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7426271 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7426272 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out
7426273 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7426274 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7426275 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7426276 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7426277 in light of mr gerhartsreiters history of deceitful behavior any statements made by him should be viewed with extreme skepticism
7426278 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7426279 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7426280 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region

7426510 a sharp fall in crude oil prices on friday in new york and positive mood in key asian markets would help the bulls build on fridays gains
7426511 with dvorak our largest venue it was vital that everyone involved with the project be in agreement with how the space finished out which resulted in a series of meetings and color selections for the finished project
7426512 as a primary venue dvorak could not be left out of the new life given to the fine arts of the university
7426513 it had always been a part of the construction plan that the construction crews would work their way out of the building doing dvorak concert hall last since no classes will be offered in dvorak and since it has access to seventh street
7426514 with the copper cladding of the entire stage shell completely new state of the art acoustical treatments completely new seats and redesigned walls ceiling and floor treatments the entire concert hall will appear to everyone to be a new space
7426515 as with all the performance venues antoine predock took the buildings outside materials inside
7426516 the exterior glass comes inside in the glass clad recital hall and the glass lined concourse from red glass to mirrored glass to black glass to white glass
7426517 and the exterior concrete comes inside in the stained and polished floors of the concourse and hallways
7426518 it was very important to get that perfect not too bright because of the stage lights and not too dark to lose the copper effect
7426519 here is the nexus where construction meets art i think weve succeeded with just the right finish
7426520 it would have been prohibitively expensive to ship them back to springfield for surplus so mr predock decided to keep them as an act of homage to the old building
7426521 for example try to find the wall with john malkovichs signature when he was a student at eastern
7426522 the concert hall will be the venue for marquee events

7426532 gc 2008 los sims 3 ya tienen fecha de salida
7426533 i moved in a day early and so my roommate wasnt here yet
7426534 stuff like quakin the quad where you have to go out and meet people its really nice
7426535 it actually tastes like the milk left over after you eat cinnamon toast crunch
7426536 we just wanted to bring new things a whole lot of different flavors for people who have never experienced anything like this
7426537 and its not just freshmen youre meeting upperclassmen too who have experience and so you can ask them questions about life here and classes
7426538 you get to meet everybody and mingle its a good way to break people in so when you see them on campus you can actually have a conversation
7426539 you know in charleston theres not that much to do especially when youre not from here and so it opens you up for the weekend
7426540 we just got out of football camp so this is the only time we really get to have fun
7426541 were out here with the new players having fun and meeting new people
7426542 im excited and nervous but im living with someone i know so i think itll be fun
7426543 were a part of the eastern family and when new students get here theyre joining the eastern family so you just want to help family
7426544 i remember when i got to college i think i had two suitcases and a phonograph player
7426545 shes the baby but ive been planning for college since she was born
7426546 im very attached to my dad so im probably going to get emotional
7426547 the panther pals met us at the car with the cart unloaded us and were ready to rock
7426548 i knew when i moved in last year it was really hard and confusing
7426549 theres a lot of organization that takes place behind the scenes
7426550 i realized once you get involved that it can be a different story
7426551 it helps students connect with other students faculty and staff
7426552 you can engage in things on campus service undergrad research and learn how to be a member of the community
7426553 this program helps them to know what it means to say i am eiu
7426554 i say if you can get that one student to stay over the first weekend then you have done your job
7426555 it helps the students get connected with the university and this can help bring back the students after the fall semester
7426556 it helps that the university can help students find a way to know many people and get comfortable
7426557 this is not good for the university so im going to leave and come back in an hour
7426558 if youre not done were going to have a couple of new department chairs
7426559 he realized students would benefit from more options and by the time they graduated it would be in their best interests he was very student oriented
7426560 changes in the curriculum which has helped the student as well as upgraded the universitys academic standards
7426561 he was very honest through his hard work he shaped the university in a positive way people even today benefit because of the hard work he did when he was here
7426562 he commanded a great deal of respect without having to make much of an effort
7426563 we knew his expectations of us and would not have thought of disappointing him
7426564 he was an upstanding moral person who believed in hard work and he had such integrity
7426565 behind his stern exterior he had a very good heart
7426566 i always felt he looked upon eastern as another base on which you serve
7426567 he understood when youre an officer in the service you know what your area of responsibility is and you tend to it he was a no nonsense kind of guy
7426568 without that experience you may chart your lifes course with insufficient information
7426569 provide undergraduate students with one of their first opportunities for collegiate academic engagement
7426570 how has this book affected the way you look on life
7426571 the only limits i have standing in the way of my dreams are the ones i place upon myself
7426572 he was one of those people you just dont forget
7426573 when people talked to him he gave them his undivided attention
7426574 its one thing to read and see about it but to do something about it is different
7426575 i had ex nfl stars mothers and professors that i was serving
7426576 when i heard someone say you came all the way from chicago to feed me it clicked that this is something that i want to do for the rest of my life
7426577 dont let the fear of failure keep you away from your lifes passion
7426578 the kind of separatist statements that she has made she should have been immediately arrested and put behind the bars jail is the rightful place for a person like mehbooba mufti she is spreading venom and if the senior leaders asked for an explanation for her statements during the all party conference they didnt do anything wrong

7426583 i dont think that were trying to make our rules consistent with the nfl but we have to realize those people spend lots of time and money on studying rules
7426584 i think it does help some for them to give insight to us
7426585 if we have an inadvertent whistle somebody gets the short end of the stick
7426586 we have as many unknowns about ourselves as weve ever had
7426587 perrilloux is sort of a core piece right now to us offensively which never having a day of practice we have a lot to find out about who we are when we hit the field in august
7426588 what that means is your offense isnt good enough to get in the end zone
7426589 i think the thing well rely on holland more in his knowledge of the game and his ability to make sure were in the right plays and the right calls
7426590 probably his best attribute looking at it from a defensive coach perspective is the fact that hes such a great student of a game he studies a lot of video so he knows whats going on at all positions
7426591 it is nice getting recognition in the beginning of the season
7426592 obviously it does not matter if nothing happens during the season
7426593 he played with colorado this year and ocean city as well but when you bang 11 goals each year you are going to get some notoriety as well
7426594 he is going to bang in a few of those chances per game thats what we expect from him and thats what hes been doing the last few years
7426595 he knows it will be difficult for him but hey it can be done
7426596 if he goes out there and scores a lot of goals and plays real well he has the opportunity to do it
7426597 we worked really hard but just couldnt make plays at certain times
7426598 our work ethic wasnt a question at all we just couldnt make plays
7426599 we joined the league in 1996 and i think this is going to be the strongest conference since ive been here
7426600 i think with a coupling of those two things you get better programs you get better teams and all of a sudden you get a better league
7426601 its a knockdown drag out every week like it should be
7426602 some teams have got to figure out how to win the close games thats where the point of separation is because theyre going to be close games
7426603 i would bet you right now the champion wont be undefeated
7426604 the league is just going to be too equal the stronger commitment each program makes the better player you put on the field in my opinion
7426605 i got to looking at our scores last year and our margin of victory was not a whole lot last year in a lot of games
7426606 you saw that happen last year in a couple games
7426607 you see a team thats picked probably seventh or eighth beating up on a no 2 or no 3 seeded team youve got to be ready to play every week in and out if youre not upsets are going to happen
7426608 there are a lot of great players a lot of great teams in this league which makes it even more fun to play on saturdays
7426609 tff should not think that the current assistance would for long lasting its high time they formulated strategies to resolve the crisis should state house stop payment
7426610 they are going to answer these questions how do you give bonuses without performance appraisals that is against the public finance management act
7426611 we have as many unknowns about ourselves as weve ever had
7426612 perrilloux is sort of a core piece right now to us offensively which never having a day of practice we have a lot to find out about who we are when we hit the field in august
7426613 what that means is your offense isnt good enough to get in the end zone
7426614 i think the thing well rely on holland more in his knowledge of the game and his ability to make sure were in the right plays and the right calls
7426615 probably his best attribute looking at it from a defensive coach perspective is the fact that hes such a great student of a game he studies a lot of video so he knows whats going on at all positions
7426616 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7426617 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
7426618 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
7426619 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
7426620 and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks
7426621 i just woke up again and my god its only been an hour and our dot looks not much closer at all to nairobi

7426627 i just want to say i am absolutely thrilled to have joe biden as my vice president
7426628 the conversations weve been having the last couple of days make me absolutely convinced he is the right man for the job
7426629 hes got the passion the wisdom of middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots hes got the expertise to make him a great counselor in any international crises that may come up
7426630 more importantly i think he can help shape a long term strategy to make america more secure after the disastrous economic and foreign policy that have characterized the last eight years
7426631 is not your standard washington fare this is a person who challenges the status quo

7426638 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7426639 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope

7426684 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs

7426732 they are going to take 10 palestinian students with them
7426733 the idea is to get them out of gaza to cyprus and then off to universities elsewhere
7426734 it was political the point was to break the siege and change israeli policy in gaza it wasnt a one time thing we are going to continue bringing boats into gaza and those will have humanitarian assistance on board
7426735 they let these two boats in so i dont see why they wouldnt let a third one in

7426770 the blink rate of the liars slows down because lying is more mentally demanding than telling the truth
7426771 liars have a number of things to think about when they formulate their lie they have to ask themselves is the lie plausible will it adhere to what people may find out is it consistent will i remember what i said when i re tell the lie does the person i am lying to believe me

7426789 ha ragione il popolo palestinese ha sofferto e sta ancora soffrendo ed vero che hanno subito una nakba sessantanni fa e che c unimportante lezione da imparare ma la lezione da imparare non che la nakba fu il risultato della creazione dello stato disraele semmai fu il risultato del fatto che le leadership palestinese e araba rifiutarono la risoluzione onu che stabiliva la creazione di uno stato ebraico e di uno stato arabo palestinese la leadership ebraica accett la risoluzione ma quelle palestinese e araba non la accettarono come peraltro avevano diritto di fare quello che non era loro diritto era aggredire il neonato stato ebraico con lobiettivo come allepoca riconobbero esplicitamente di avviare una guerra di sterminio il risultato fu quindi una doppia nakba non solo sofferenza per arabi palestinesi e la creazione del problema dei profughi palestinesi ma anche con laggressione a israele e agli ebrei dei paesi arabi la creazione di un secondo gruppo di profughi molto meno noto i profughi ebrei dai paesi arabi

7426794 for a long time no one here was interested in remembering
7426795 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
7426796 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
7426797 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
7426798 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
7426799 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
7426800 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
7426801 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
7426802 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
7426803 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
7426804 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
7426805 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
7426806 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
7426807 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
7426808 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
7426809 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
7426810 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
7426811 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
7426812 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
7426813 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
7426814 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
7426815 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
7426816 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
7426817 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
7426818 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
7426819 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
7426820 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
7426821 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
7426822 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
7426823 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
7426824 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
7426825 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
7426826 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
7426827 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
7426828 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

7426835 the original star wars movies were designed for kids nevertheless the mythology behind them was very much adult the heros journey and destroying your author and finding your own place in the world
7426836 we still go no matter what because we hope to get some bread crumbs of the original feeling of star wars
7426837 im hoping for a few thrills but not expecting much i guess i gave up on that a long time ago i just dont think lucas has that in him anymore
7426838 hes really focusing on the kid market theres a sense of abnegation when i circumstance see the lo rd of the rings or a thing like that thats what i hope for from the star wars universe
7426839 star wars is just for kids but everybody seems to in the same manner as it
7426840 this is really at exactly the same level as the feature films we didnt dumb it down the series is really designed for adolescents kids going from being children to becoming adults
7426841 eventually we may do a tv series that is skewed for younger kids 5 and 6 year olds but this isnt that
7426842 people always deficiency to see someone like themselves up on the screen
7426843 luke did that for a whole generation i think anakin was that again for another generation ahsoka was a chance to add to anakins character in a way that could take off ones guard us and give us a new dimension to him
7426844 suddenly responsible hes a father a teacher that transition from i am being taken watchfulness of to now i am seizure care of others is in all of the stories that is the repeating theme
7426845 i was a big fan of the original and this was a shout i play a college professor i wish i had something more interesting to say that some robot that attacks me or that i blow up in some interesting fantastical way but its nothing like that
7426846 its a tough movie for me to describe to people because its a ninja comedy and people immediately suppose about that chris farley movie beverly hills ninja but its not
7426847 i play one on a tv show and have played them before and people have seen me in the same proportion that that frankly i can conclude a lot more and different stuff i dont want to limit myself
7426848 there is always this fear in hollywood that oh characters need to be likable and relatable and i dont know if thats necessarily the case i think that characters need to be human and they need to be recognizable but they dont have to necessarily be likable
7426849 that opens a whole world of comic possibilities i enjoy playing essentially unlikable characters and really committing to it and digging in
7426850 the one thing that really amazed me about dwight was that people delight in him hes so obnoxious hes vile and petty but people are gaga for him as a character they feel for him and adore him and its just because its well written and a specific characterization its real
7426851 everyone says we have a dwight in our office everyone says that which is pretty astonishing dwight is an amish beet farmer paper salesman with militant fascistic tendencies
7426852 but everyone feels they have a dwight in their office
7426853 great are you going to give out my request too
7426854 my first real dealing with rainn was a rehearsal sitting at my house that we had in the place of
7426855 within 15 minutes rainn took not upon all his clothes and was diving into the swimming pool total rock star behavior hes a rocker at heart
7426856 he can be touching and dramatic or off the wall and hilarious depending on the situation
7426857 hes whatever he needs to be he is a demi god that has come to earth to condescension us with his multiple talents which include comedy unfiltered sarcasm and the ability to retain his nobleness while riding a tricycle into a pool
7426858 show me your karate show me your karate punch ok
7426859 the senior wilson says and the boy shrinks into a ball
7426860 what separates them is that dwight is very tightly wound and i think fish is very loosely wound
7426861 dwight may not have existence the brightest bulb but hes very exacting and rigorous and there is a lenient of philosophy that guides everything he does in that way hes real thoughtful and fish is completely thoughtless really fish lets it the whole of hang out and is loose and just wants to be a rock n roller
7426862 is not profound were not dealing with citizen kane here but its nice to have a story that has more heart to it
7426863 its this movie about a dowdy with these kids but hes the unit who needs to come of age
7426864 a two gyves i have in the fire have a little more darker edge to them
7426865 my ideal movie to make is one i have actually written a second rough copy on one ive been working on with oscar nominated juno boss jason reitman called bonzai shadowhands about a down and out alcoholic ninja
7426866 its a very dark comedy the most messed up version of the karate kid you can imagine that fits my sensibility well
7426867 he knows how to make anything real thats what youre looking for in a comedy these days a guy who can take an outlandish situation and make it somewhat honest and believable hes just a fantastic actor while his technique has been used to make really funny tv and movies what he hasnt had the opportunity to do yet is use that to simply move people in dramatic moments
7426868 ginger tries out for the football team and the whole team is up in arms i was gingers dad
7426869 all of a sudden girls started being interested in me
7426870 i had the lead in the school play and girls were like heeeey how are you

7426872 i was playing the nurses assistant in a bus and truck touring production of romeo and juliet for a year and a half thats where i started i was 23 just gotten out of college at nyu i worked my way up from there
7426873 i had a lot of side jobs i had some of the overcome jobs i did a lot of catering and waiting tables thats pretty model still for a while i sold insurance and i worked at the multiple sclerosis society to the degree that some abettor special events coordinator
7426874 fans will come up to meet me and want me to say anything that will let them slip in a thats that which she said theyll be like so do you like acting and im like i like it and theyll say thats what she said theyll slip one in

7426879 things may be a certain way at the beginning but it may take longer if things change
7426880 i just think these children are in worse shape than the american children
7426881 when families first come to us they have this vision of those little girls about 2 years old who dont have lots of issues
7426882 when children are a little older they have endured a little more trauma and have behavior that reflects that trauma
7426883 a lot of people go into adoptions with the gerber baby as their initial expectation
7426884 i gave up waiting for mr right going internationally didnt even cross my mind

7426973 i think traders in asia are now feeling a bottom to the market after prices fell over 6 on friday so some of them may be seeing a buying opportunity at these price levels

7426982 the idea that you can pick someone off like this and actually pick them off because you think they are chinese and will just go quietly and wont stand up for themselves i tell you that is not the new zealand we support
7426983 there are still new zealanders who make decisions on the basis of superficial things like race and colour and that is something i would have expected the epmu to feel strongly about

7426986 c tait un match frustrant pour nous et nous devons donner du cr dit middlesbrough pour cela confie lirlandais beaucoup d quipes viennent ici en voluant avec beaucoup de joueurs derri re la balle ce nest pas une surprise
7426987 peu importe quand je marquerai ce qui mint resse cest de gagner on est d j tous concentr s sur le match de mercredi contre le standard nous sommes conscients de limportance de ce match quon ne prendra pas la l g re jesp re que ce sera une grande soir e europ enne mercredi
7426988 gagner en jouant mal nous a offert assez de confiance pour accueillir le standard si nous jouons bien mercredi la victoire peut tre simple d crocher mais m me si nous ne sommes pas dans un bon jour nous pourrons aussi nous qualifier ce liverpool l a assez de classe et de ressources morales pour tre dangereux pour nimporte quel adversaire
7426989 je n tais pas sur la liste des joueurs devant se pr senter la presse
7426990 cest nous qui avons rendu le match plus facile si lon ne peut pas estimer avoir r alis une partie exceptionnelle on a su faire ce quil fallait afin d viter toute mauvaise surprise lanimation de jeu tait parfois un peu lente et lon a tard donner certaines passes sans cons quence maintenant il y a un match pr parer pour mercredi et l on devra hausser notre rythme de jeu car liverpool dispose dune autre vitesse dex cution que celle de westerlo ce sera un tout autre adversaire dans une autre comp tition tout ira plus vite et nous serons vigilants
7426991 le coach a insist sur le fait de n gocier intelligemment certaines parties de match cest ce que lon a appliqu une fois un double avantage acquis de plus on a su plier le match en inscrivant le troisi me ce nest pas quil ne fallait pas se fatiguer mais il fallait le faire avec intelligence
7426992 le coach voulait me montrer des l ments de mon jeu qui marchent mais quil nappr cie que tr s moyennement mais cette s ance na pas t quune liste de reproches disons que mon jeu est fait de risques calcul s mais le coach naime pas je comprends sa position et je vais matteler faire de mon mieux afin de rencontrer sa satisfaction
7426993 a certains moments il faut prendre des risques mesur s sinon dans le foot tu ne progresses pas m me si ces gestes tent s le sont r guli rement dans une portion de terrain loign e de mon propre but et donc sans vrai danger je vais mentra ner pour r duire cette marge jug e risqu e par le coach parfois mes options permettent aussi dacc l rer le jeu de l quipe

7426995 sail has corrected sharply in the recent past and offers value particularly considering the projected sharp increase in its steel making capacity the improving product mix and cost structure will enable company to maintain its profit margins until the price freeze is maintained once the inflation recedes which is expected by the end of the year we expect sail to increase prices the company continues to be virtually debt free which will help the company to fund its capacity expansions over the next two years we recommend buy on sail with a target price of rs 167

7427004 today people expect more content and more detail about events as they happen through the it infrastructure that atos origin has designed built and operated during the beijing 2008 olympic games the competition results have been viewed and read by more people and on more channels web mobile phone and tv than ever before atos origin our long term partner is the brains behind the operations for the olympic games consistently delivering on schedule and within budget
7427005 the remote cis service provided by atos origin has been nothing short of exceptional system execution and delivery was flawless for the first time nbc producers and commentators in new york had real time access to live results data as our teams in beijing this has enabled nbc to work more efficiently and effectively saving real money by allowing us to reduce production personnel in beijing
7427006 it is changing the way that the olympic games are viewed and we at atos origin are playing a mission critical role in ensuring that richer more detailed and colourful content is available immediately to audiences around the world in the way that they want to receive it
7427007 as the beijing 2008 olympic games end our teams are already focussed on next months paralympic games in beijing the vancouver 2010 winter olympics games and the london 2012 olympic games we are proud to be a partner to the international olympic committee and we support and share its values for performance diversity and fair play
7427008 there is little time left to get a solid negotiation text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
7427009 the clock is ticking we need to be more pragmatic and move beyond rhetoric to make progress as we move towards copenhagen
7427010 we cant allow ourselves to be too late we need to move from the era of words to the era of action
7427011 two years after exhaustive talks in nairobi we are back in accra for more negotiations we need to move forward
7427012 if we pull together we can make a world of difference
7427013 i can do this i can do this i know i can do this
7427014 well only 15 mins and ill have done the full shift so i may as well carry on im so close
7427015 were not really surprised we had indications fitness reports in late and we hadnt heard from him in three weeks
7427016 no phone calls no email thats life you have to be at training camp to be on the hockey team i dont know im pretty busy this week and im not going to chase brad riege down pretty simple
7427017 i thought brad couldve played a very big role on our hockey club and no one can seem to get ahold of him to find out where he is or why
7427018 he hasnt phoned to ask for a trade and we have now heard third hand that he might be quitting hockey and working with his dad nobody knows a month ago he was looking forward to coming back but things have obviously changed in a month
7427019 he filled a role for us last year and hes a guy with three years in the league so not having him is something well miss
7427020 it looks like everybody put in a pretty good summer some guys lost some weight and put that back on in muscle
7427021 well see how that translates to being on ice if youre looking for a guy who dramatically changed the way he looks its dale hunt hes lost 20 pounds from where he was at the end of last year he struggled a bit through his first two years here but he seems to be refocused and has dedicated himself he had a personal trainer in winnipeg and i think the fact he had injuries and was passed over in the draft was motivation for him to prove a lot of people wrong
7427022 i wont name names now but anyone in that five to 10 goal range last season some 19 year old guys coming back who have to produce
7427023 weve got anywhere from two to six 16 year olds who could make our hockey club
7427024 i think last year everything was far too loosey goosey this year we dont want to be the laughingstock we have to be ready to go and that begins with holding the veterans accountable
7427025 it will be tough but im looking forward to watching all these players because everybody knows where we stand and that we are looking for players to earn their way onto our 50 player list

7427050 de vzw lateuf organiseert de nationale competitie al een paar jaar
7427051 het waren telkens andere promotoren die de europese licentie opkochten en aan ons vroegen de competitie te organiseren dit jaar is de belgische voetbalbond voor het eerst verantwoordelijk en ze hebben ons weer ingeschakeld de competitie wordt tijdens het seizoen op zaterdag en zondag gespeeld de eerste manche was in antwerpen en voor de andere manches zijn ze naar de kust verhuisd
7427052 de twee competities zijn bijna identiek en op het einde van het seizoen strijden de acht beste ploegen voor de titel in de toekomst hopen we een systeem te organiseren zoals bij het voetbal met een eerste klasse en daaronder provinciale afdelingen daar wordt volop aan gewerkt
7427053 een van onze scheidsrechters heeft op het wk in marseille gefloten andere scheidsrechters fluiten over heel europa volgens die ervaren scheidsrechters staat de belgische competitie op de vierde plaats na spanje portugal en itali

7427058 niet zozeer puur geschiedenis vertellen maar door het verleden te kennen de samenleving verbeteren
7427059 in een eerste fase zal de compagnie des bronzes waarnaar de site en de naam van la fonderie verwijst weer tot leven gewekt worden
7427060 al is dit geen museum over de bronsgieterij alleen toch is de fabriek de rode draad omdat ze typisch was voor een brusselse onderneming die zich
7427061 het moet een soort industrieel archeologische site worden de site is nog niet beschermd maar ze staat wel al op de bewaarlijst dat wil zeggen dat bepaald is wat wel of niet kan met de gebouwen maar dan zonder de financi le tegemoetkoming
7427062 la fonderie is gegroeid uit de buurtvereniging la rue van in het begin was de verlaten compagnie des bronzes de spil om een sloop te vermijden moest er geld komen de franse gemeenschapscommissie co cof heeft toen de site gekocht en is nog steeds de eigenaar om veiligheidsredenen zijn er in de jaren 1980 wel een paar gebouwen afgebroken het blijft pijnlijk om naar die sloop die uiteraard gefilmd werd te kijken ach de jaren tachtig
7427063 een soort romantische tuin in het centrum van de stad amper tien minuten wandelen van de beurs en misschien komt er dan af en toe eens een nieuwsgierige binnen piepen
7427064 we willen voor iedereen toegankelijk zijn daarom onderhandelen we met de ge ntegreerde online catalogus pallas ik vind het interessant om uiteindelijk alles met alles te verbinden aan de ene kant de machines aan de andere kant ontwerpen fotos of film ervan maar ook mondelinge getuigenissen van arbeiders die met deze machines aan de slag waren
7427065 twee dossiers liggen dezer dagen voor dat van de kachelfabriek godin en de mooie art decogebouwen van delhaize met sgraffiti toegeschreven aan paul cauchie er zijn links met de voedingsindustrie het transportwezen met distributie de eigenaar wil er een groot torengebouw neerzetten dat is absurd we moeten dus waakzaam blijven
7427066 het is altijd de bedoeling geweest om met les cahiers een groot publiek aan te spreken al worden ze grotendeels door specialisten geschreven academici worden te weinig opgeleid om vulgariserend te schrijven en illustraties zijn minstens even belangrijk in puur wetenschappelijke tijdschriften wordt die plaats ingenomen door ellenlange voetnoten jammer dat de verspreiding altijd onder de verwachtingen is gebleven oplage van ongeveer duizend ad misschien moet la fonderie zich gewoon wat commerci ler opstellen
7427067 de inhoud van die tentoonstelling was de essentie van de collectie die we aan het opbouwen zijn het was de eerste keer dat een tentoonstelling als thema de geschiedenis van de gemeente had
7427068 en het voelde heel natuurlijk om die in la fonderie te organiseren
7427069 la fonderie is een uniek initiatief van onderuit begonnen het was een harde strijd die slaagde dankzij de onverzettelijke guido vanderhulst hij roeide in tegen de stroom van erfgoed light hij vocht voor het behoud van oud ijzer met een ziel en voor de mens die erachter schuilgaat voor guido gaat die strijd verder kijk maar naar zijn actie voor het behoud van de kachelfabriek godin in laken
7427070 het eerste hoogtepunt voor de vereniging was ongetwijfeld de tentoonstelling brussel een kanaal fabrieken en mensen belangrijk was ook dat la fonderie in 1990 het voortouw nam in de organisatie van het zevende internationaal congres voor het behoud van het industrieel erfgoed
7427071 la fonderie werd een museum maar is ook veel meer dan dat een actiegroep hoewel dit de laatste tijd minder het geval is een documentatiecentrum een gidsenorganisatie
7427072 de laatste tien jaar hoor ik nog weinig van la fonderie terwijl er nog enorm veel werk is op het gebied van het hergebruik van het industrieel patrimonium volgens mij ligt de toekomst niet in een herbestemming als museum of als hippe loft maar in het aantrekken van kleine en middelgrote ondernemingen in de binnenstad in die sector denken ze nog altijd dat ze met hun bedrijven naar de stadsrand moeten verhuizen
7427073 thurn amp taxis en de brouwerij wielemans ceuppens gered die zijn helemaal niet gered sommige van hun stenen staan nog op elkaar dat is alles er wordt te veel gewerkt vanuit steenbehoud en niet vanuit infrastructuur die een antwoord kan bieden aan de grootstedelijke behoeften
7427074 ik denk dat jonge mensen niet meer weten wat werken in een fabriek was dat beeld oproepen in combinatie met het ongelooflijke werk dat verzet is op het vlak van sociale wetgeving
7427075 begonnen met een handvol vrijwilligers vechten voor subsidies het oprichten van een documentatiecentrum en uiteindelijk een museum dat is niet niets zonder la fonderie had brussel er waarschijnlijk net iets anders uit gezien
7427076 industrieel erfgoed draait niet alleen om spectaculaire realisaties over heel brussel verspreid staan gebouwen die waardevol zijn maar te weinig aandacht krijgen la fonderie zou zich kunnen richten op enkele van die kleinschalige sites
7427077 en waarom geen nieuwe inventaris van industrieel erfgoed om een overzicht te hebben bovendien is de strijd nooit gestreden want politiek personeel verandert de mentaliteit verandert en wat gisteren nog ok was kan morgen in vraag worden gesteld
7427078 met guido is alles begonnen en zijn belang valt onmogelijk te onderschatten guido w s la fonderie hij spendeerde er uren en uren en hoopte dat iedereen dat zou doen na hem is de sfeer misschien iets losser geworden
7427079 in zekere zin hebben ze de vader vermoord maar dat is normaal ze maken andere keuzes dan ik maar dat is niet erg dat het project wordt voortgezet dat is het belangrijkste actie voeren is niet hun grootste zorg maar mijn wens was altijd dat la fonderie met dezelfde inspiratie werd verdergezet en dat is w l het geval
7427080 het is goed dat het depot in anderlecht een dak krijgt maar die selectie machines die naar hier werd overgebracht om te bezichtigen en vraag me niets over les cahiers een cahier over congo is dat nodig ik zou het veel meer hier verankerd houden maar nog eens zij doen wat zij doen

7427097 they dont target sharks on a daily basis but they have to make a living
7427098 unfortunately there are sensitive people out there but a living has to be made
7427099 naturally divers get upset when after enjoying a passive interaction with sharks they see a boat full of dead sharks at the same slipway they launch from
7427100 this is not good business for the eco tourism industry
7427101 at the same time we cannot wait years for the results of the research as there will be hardly any sharks left by then
7427102 we therefore urge a precautionary approach applied to shark fisheries where data is lacking

7427104 shall we accept good from god and not trouble is there any wickedness on my lips can my mouth not discern malice although i am blameless i have no concern for myself you know that i am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand i have become a laughingstock to my friends though i called upon god and he answered a mere laughingstock though righteous and blameless indeed this will turn out for my deliverance for no godless man would dare come before him can anyone bring charges against me if so i will be silent and die how many wrongs and sins have i committed show me my offense and my sin my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure even now my witenss is in heaven my advocate is on high my intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to god on behalf of a man he pleads with god as a man pleads for his friend my feet have closely followed his steps i have kept to his way without turning aside i have not departed from the commands of his lips i have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread as long as i have life within me the breath of god in my nostrils my lips will not speak wickedness and my tongue will utter no deceit i will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it my conscience will not reproach me as long as i live i put on righteousness as my clothing justice was my robe and my turban if i have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit let god weigh me in honest scales and he will know that i am blameless if my steps have turned from the path if my heart has been led by my eyes or if my hands have been defiled then may others eat what i have sown and may my crops be uprooted if my heart has been enticed by a woman or if i have lurked at my neighbors door then may my wife grind another mans grain and may othyer men sleep with her for that would have been shameful a sin to be judged i have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse my enemies if i have concealed my sin as men do by hiding my guilt in my heart surely i would wear it on my shoulder i would put it on like a crown i am pure and without sin i am clean and free from guilt although i am right i am considered a liar

7427322 i am serious i thank god for making me an idiot that gift has not only opened so many doors for me but has put a lot of money into my bank account same gift has made people to laugh and forget their sorrows as you have rightly said i do not try to be funny everything about me is funny
7427323 my talk is funny my movements are funny my tastes are funny especially my taste for food and women
7427324 i used to be the poorest in my village eziokwe nkanu west l g enugu state but now the story is different i might not be a millionaire presently but i am comfortable you can see that i have used what god gave me to get what i want in life

7427330 during the boom we got into the trading up mentality
7427331 we lived through a housing period where it was raining money only an idiot wouldnt have put a bucket outside to catch some
7427332 living through an era when we thought our homes may make us rich has resulted in a permanent shift in thinking one that will leave many of us happily obsessed with houses for years to come

7427335 i think were in a time where taking two years off of work and getting an mba will allow me to get much better paying jobs
7427336 hopefully the economy will be rebounding by then and making its return to where it was a couple years ago
7427337 while there is anecdotal evidence theres no evidence of an overall trend
7427338 typically the trend is when the economy goes sour people look for ways to better themselves or their professional opportunities and one way to do that is to further their education
7427339 when the economy goes down the opportunity cost of attaining education is lower because your expected earnings are lower
7427340 opposing that is the ability to finance your education so if you dont have any money to finance it even though its the right time to do it you may not
7427341 it might set me back for a year initially but in the long run ill have a higher marketability rate with my further education

7427349 this is the true joy in life the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap the being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy

7427380 five or six years ago the need for a four day work week wasnt really accepted by management
7427381 i would suspect a majority of employees would probably be in favor of something like this these days
7427382 we have a lot of younger staff members and they drive an average of 30 miles a day it was becoming an issue for them
7427383 what drove me over the edge is we lost one of our really valuable staff members who got a new job because he couldnt afford the extra price of gas
7427384 one reason employers offer these gas saving perks is to keep their best and brightest from seeking positions closer to home
7427385 the same amount of work gets done and everyone gets a three day weekend
7427386 i wrote you several months ago about my son who almost died back in october 2007 from vitamin a poisoning the dermatologist taking care of him had prescribed accutane and that seems to have been the cause
7427387 he has been using milk of magnesia topically at bedtime for months now our pediatrician ran a test to make sure he wasnt getting too much magnesium and also retested the vitamin a level to see if it had come back to normal
7427388 the happy news is that both magnesium and vitamin a levels are normal my son looks great and feels well
7427389 we are pleased i think we have won obviously these guys are moving on
7427390 we think it affects the health of the cow they dont breed back it causes mastitis problems the cows become disposable
7427391 these guys have big money for lobbyists and scientists they might try to reintroduce it in canada
7427392 they have a lot more money to spend than a bunch of farmers from renfrew county
7427393 hmmm you kind of caught me off guard there a little bit i dont know maybe a lot of people dont know that back in high school i was a two sport athlete i played football in high school i played quarterback so i was always active with both sports i guess thats something people probably dont know about me
7427394 i guess an injury made the choice for me i broke my foot playing football in my last year of high school my senior year so it kind of made my decision a little bit easier because i didnt have as many opportunities to play at the college level once i got hurt
7427395 hmmm i dont know i guess id like to be a lawyer id like to get in and debate things with people and try to prove points to people and stuff thats something id be interested in
7427396 i like to take advantage of my off days and relax a little bit maybe sleep in a little bit go grab some lunch kind of hang out i kind of like to stay to myself a little bit im around these guys all the time so ill maybe grab some lunch by myself or just go run a few errands if i need to take care of a few things just kind of relax take it easy maybe make some phone calls to some family or friends people i havent caught up with in a while just take care of some personal things
7427397 the biggest difference would be the travel just getting around in texas its more of an open space youre driving down an open road and you can just stop off at the store or grab a bite to eat or do this or do that you can see where youre going laughs around here if you dont know where youre going its hard to see that probably just the travel has been the biggest difference for me just being able to get around while not knowing the area just trying to find where im going youve got to make a right turn to go left if you know what i mean it gets a little frustrating and its easy to get turned around so just the travel
7427398 i wish i could bring my fiancee with me outside of that i dont really think i have anything that stands out that id like to have with me maybe some more family and stuff like that id like to see my family more often
7427399 no not really i dont really get involved in that much i mean ill listen to a little bit of everything music wise movies i obviously watch movies but i dont really get into it in depth like a lot of people do i just kind of go with the flow
7427400 i enjoy shooting some pool just going out with some friends and shooting some pool i enjoy fishing a little bit i dont get to do it much but fishing i used to enjoy hunting a lot with my dad when i was younger but i dont really do that much anymore either just hang out with friends and stuff play pool or maybe some darts stuff like that
7427401 no i dont play golf i never really got involved in it i keep kind of telling myself im going to but i never do
7427402 its changed when i first got here lets see my first roommate was steven jackson currently its kind of been kevin whelan before that it was phil coke i think thats it just those three
7427403 its just tough being able to stay on a routine when it comes to eating and stuff like that things change everywhere you go you might have a place to eat where you are you might not the late night eating you know sometimes in the clubhouses they may not have something that youll eat or you like and youve got to make do somehow it might be trying to order something with delivery or something like that id probably say overall just the eating arrangements are not always intact like they would be elsewhere especially for me because im a picky eater that might be something a lot of people dont know about me
7427404 define picky ask me if i eat it and ill tell you yes or no laughs
7427405 pretty much to narrow it down ill eat chicken but i dont eat any kind of red meat i just never liked it i just never have i eat chicken and thats it theres not much lunchmeat that i eat or anything like that its pretty much chicken and thats it
7427406 on that day you will realize that i am in my father and you are in me and i am in you
7427407 i never realized how much work it was really going to be

7427421 my task was only to hear the oath and i had no part in the drafting of the oath which saiful made it is also unimportant for me so specify who
7427422 i also wish to deny that i received any money to witness the swearing i was only acting on instructions
7427423 during the swearing saiful mispronounced one of the islamic words because he had it written down in malay instead of arabic
7427424 saiful also made a mistake on when anwar ibrahim had allegedly inserted his penis into his rectum
7427425 instead of june 26 saiful said he was sodomised on august 26 before correcting himself
7427426 i only joined umno because of a friend and since i dont hold any positions in the party ive nothing to be afraid of
7427427 im not active even and i can be said to be a fake member
7427428 many people would call or even text me on sms short messaging system to scold me and accuse me of not being a legitimate imam
7427429 although im not the imam besar im a real imam
7427430 i also want to make known that i am neither an ulema nor the imam besar as what some reports have said
7427431 for me it is as it was done on the eve of nomination day
7427432 when the attacks began no one defended me but im thankful that pkr has invited me to state my case
7427433 he came to see me here in permatang pauh and told me who he was he said he was a witness at saifuls swearing ceremony
7427434 i was surprised and asked him what he wanted to which he said he had to tell the truth
7427435 counseled and procured the unholly compromise by officials lacking in integrity of the various institutions that have been put into place by our constitution to preserve and protect the rights of the rakyat
7427436 it was a reiteration of the governments policy to continue its brutal war on muslims
7427437 the indian state too has targeted muslims branding them terrorist after 9 11 and the indian parliament attack muslims were targeted once again our party is willing to unite in a broad front with all the genuine democratic forces which would be willing to fight back the hindu fascist offensive
7427438 the situation is tense but under control two inspector generals and two digs have been deputed in the district and section 144 has been promulgated in the district said director general of police gopal nanda
7427439 if the police had taken precautionary measures taken the incident could have been prevented
7427440 it was a well calculated plan to eliminate the biggest obstacle against proselytisation of kondh tribes and dalits in khandhamal
7427441 the government has squarely failed in its constitutional duty in protecting the life of swamiji
7427442 the single greatest strength america has in the middle east
7427443 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq and conversely if iraq were transported to mars does anyone think there would not be terrorism visited upon the israelis every day
7427444 so lets get it straight israel is not the cause of iraq iraq being settled or not settled has nothing to do with israels conduct
7427445 you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7427446 theres a rationale in my view why pollard should be given leniency
7427447 we have been receiving messages of condolence from members since the announcement and our close knit profession feels bens loss very deeply
7427448 life has been extremely difficult for them clinic staff since the crisis began and to have this happen on top of all theyve had to deal with will be devastating
7427449 its a coincidence the quarantine is lifted on the day of bens memorial service
7427450 ben loved his career and horses it was a major part of his life and i know he would overjoyed to finally have the ban lifted its just devastating that he cant be here

7427479 when considering ones position in an organization it is advantageous to be socially intelligent which can be thought of as being skilled at social networking knowing whom to trust and being able to form powerful relationships

7427481 politics is the process whereby social groups can take control of government institutions and use them
7427482 the ability to influence society in ways that favour some actors over others
7427483 politics becomes a horse race and a tragicomedy motivated by greed backstage manoeuvres betrayals and sex and violence a genre increasingly indistinguishable from tv scripts
7427484 the capacity to control global instrumental networks on the basis of specific identities
7427485 you also have to recall that people hate professional politicians so that people in that career have to appear fresh while being ruthless they have to seem like idealists but know how to put the knife in a rivals back as a daily practice
7427486 politics is not power as power is very different as the classic distinction between power and influence shows
7427487 this tendency toward inequality and polarization is certainly not inexorable it can be countered and prevented by deliberate public policies but inequality and polarization are prescripted in the dynamics of informational capitalism and will prevail unless conscious action is taken to countervail these tendencies

7427502 democrats gathering here are more optimistic about their partys chances in the general election than they have been from some time
7427503 still theres an undertow of worry about just how unified the party is in the wake of a bruising primary fight how enthusiastically clinton and more importantly her supporters embrace the soon to be nominee will be perhaps the most closely watched dynamic in denver

7427752 so why do these vigilantes believe public urinators and teenagers having consensual sex should be murdered answer they are scum
7427753 azu believes in murdering children for playing doctor what a sicko
7427754 i hear antipaedo used to make his own child porn be warned
7427755 i have proof that vigilantes burned down the home of a former offender in tennessee and wound up murdering his wife one of a number of violent attacks by the pj cult
7427756 educate yourself visit my blog and learn the real facts
7427757 according to the department of justice less than 8 of sex offenders re offend and most sexual abuse is committed by someone who is not on a registry which debunks the myth of
7427758 experts have often wondered what proportion of men who download explicit sexual images of children also molest them a new government study of convicted internet offenders suggests that the number may be startlingly high 85 percent of the offenders said they had committed acts of sexual abuse against minors from inappropriate touching to rape
7427759 a video of a toddler on a changing table who is penetrated by an adult male
7427760 pictures of a young girl 6 or 7 years old nude tied to a chair and being penetrated by a dog
7427761 oh they should just pick themselves up and go on and stop being victims
7427762 this is some thing i got in my mail today form eadvoate i think this could be a holy grail question and and answer will debunk or limits the ligamancy of the registry its a question i have seen asked many times but never in this way
7427763 whether the risk of offending for an ex felon ever becomes similar or equal to the risk of offending for someone who has never offended at all if so after what period of time since the last arrest or conviction does this occur
7427764 just the fact that the chances of someone not on the registry offending is 95 and someone who is on the registry is less than 5 tells me that a former sex offenders risk is already less than the general population
7427765 i pointed this statistical probability out in a local newspaper once while in a conversation with a poster called stitches
7427766 harris hanson one or the other or both out of canada looked at this and found that the risk reduces to 0 i think 15 20years post release
7427767 yes the general public is 95 more likely to commit a new sex offense but there are less than a million registered offenders in a county with 300 million people and there are only tens of thousands of sex offensed committed lets say there are 100 000 registerable sex offenses committed per year that leaves the following 5 committed by rsos or 5 000 offenses out of a million offenders that makes 1 in 200 offenders commit a new crime 95 committed by or 95 000 offenses out of 300 million people that makes 1 in 3 150 commit a new crime therefore the antis could use the argument that rsos are over 15 times likely to commit a new sex offense
7427768 there is no real way to do this without complex math somehow i think they are coming to that conclusion the wrong way by counting recidivism as the basis for assuming how many rsos actually re offend in the given year the doj study found the number of sex offenders in the study who re offended was about 550 of 9000 in 3 years while 3500 or so of the 240 000 non rsos committed a sex crime thats six times the number of non sex offenders committing a sex crime as sex offenders not counting first time offenders
7427769 because i havent met anyone who would be worth fitting into my life which is already full of family and friends who care about me and love me

7427774 parliament is sovereign and one has to look at the future of pakistans democracy as more important than individuals
7427775 i am personally in favour of restoring the chief justice but there is an opinion in the party that he has become too politicised in the last many months and led public rallies
7427776 we fought a war for democracy and all powers that musharraf had enjoyed were obviously undemocratic we need to have a debate in parliament and see how strong we want the future president to be and how strong we want to make our prime minister i think the president should not have the power to dissolve the assembly
7427777 i dont blame former president musharraf for the assassination of benazir bhutto he can live in pakistan it is my desire pervez musharraf should live in the country and see it on the path to development this will be the revenge for benazirs martyrdom
7427778 after president musharrafs resignation there will be no change in pakistan us relations and the isi was not involved in the kabul blasts

7427880 the golden rule of negotiated labour agreements is that you cannot contract out of human rights laws
7427881 there would be a lot of lawyers willing to take the case and i expect it to be tested
7427882 you cant contract out your constitutional rights or your human rights random drug testing of workers is never justified

7427893 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
7427894 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible

7427944 eher wahrscheinlich dass das rekordergebnis des vorjahres nicht erreicht wird
7427945 obwohl das ergebnis f r das gesamtjahr 2008 auf dem sehr guten niveau der letzten jahre liegen
7427946 wir haben sehr gut begonnen wir haben druck und ein schnelles tor gemacht der zwischenfall mit koch hat uns etwas aus der bahn geworfen der sieg geht vollkommen in ordnung wir haben spielerisch und vor allem k mpferisch eine sehr starke leistung gebracht den sieg wollten wir den fans schenken
7427947 ich bin sehr froh tore in diesem derby erzielt zu haben alles ist perfekt jeder hat gesehen dass wir das bessere team waren im moment sind wir das beste team jedes spiel ist unser level h her geworden
7427948 ich habe nicht mitbekommen was vorgefallen war ich hoffe das er koch anm nichts schlimmes hat solche szenen haben am fu ballplatz nichts verloren es ist relativ schnell gegangen es was war nicht viel zeit zu berlegen
7427949 es war ein letztendlich verdienter sieg rapids rapid war gut und wir haben zu wenig dagegengehalten erst als wir uns etwas befreien konnten haben wir gemerkt dass rapid probleme haben k nnte das haben wir speziell nach der pause gemacht aber dann ist der schwere fehler von bak anm gekommen das war der zeitpunkt wo wir nicht mehr richtig an den sieg gelaubt haben ich bin nicht so unzufrieden wie es das resultat erscheinen lassen k nnte die erste halbe stunde muss ich vergessen aber ich glaube wir h tten es geschafft mit dem zweiten tor war es aber vorbei
7427950 das tut mir sehr leid ich hoffe es geht ihm gut ich habe noch bei der pressekonferenz zur m igung aufgerufen leider k nnen wir solche dinge nicht beeinflussen
7427951 de ervaring leert namelijk dat wanneer beurzen opveren het herstel in de eerste periode het sterkst is als belegger mag je die belangrijke dagen dus zeker niet missen
7427952 het kan hard gaan er staat veel geld langs de zijlijn
7427953 bij mijn zoektocht naar woonruimte vielen de prijzen me hier toch nog behoorlijk tegen ik heb dus niet die indruk
7427954 we hopen alleen wel dat meer jonge nederlanders bij ons gaan aankloppen voor een baan want dat zijn er nu echt te weinig
7427955 dit past bij het verschijnsel dat financi le instellingen hier elke drie tot vijf jaar compleet veranderen om zich zodoende aan te passen aan de continu veranderende markt
7427956 alles is daarbij gericht op business over politiek wordt niet gesproken want over de midden oostenproblematiek zal men het waarschijnlijk toch niet eens worden ook over het conflict tussen rusland en georgi praten we hier niet tenzij dit iets betekent voor onze business
7427957 hinckley took his demotion to double a harrisburg very hard he sat in front of his locker for 10 minutes and said he didnt know what to do with himself
7427958 finally healthy hinckley was able to get the velocity on his fastball back and is now a quality reliever out of the bullpen for triple a columbus he has been often clocked in the low 90s mph entering sundays action hinckley had a 2 95 era in 16 games
7427959 since weve been here the last four years hinckley had no velocity never got it to 90
7427960 and now hes consistently back there so its a funny game
7427961 if hinckley comes up the washington nationals will have two left handers in the bullpen
7427962 er zijn ignace cromb enkele voorwaarden opgelegd waarna hij weer naar huis kon pas als hij die voorwaarden naleeft zal cromb niet worden vervolgd
7427963 jede politische religi se oder rassistische demonstration oder propaganda ist an den olympischen sportst tten untersagt
7427964 indeed as we know fud is not limited to the it world us president george bush knowingly lied about weapons of mass destruction wmds existing in iraq the cia reported conclusively in 2004 that no such weapons existed everyone in the u s knows what a friend to president bush the cia has been nope no political agenda here this information was widely reported in the media at the time yet public polls such as this one show that from 2004 to 2006 the proportion of americans who believe iraq had wmds actually grew substantially from 38 to 50 clearly fud is extremely hard to counter once it gains a foothold in peoples hearts and minds
7427965 ich habe von anfang an mit dem sprit geknausert das hat sich heute ausgezahlt
7427966 schade dass es heute nicht zum sieg gereicht hat denn timo und ich waren das ganze wochenende die schnellsten in der lmp2 klasse
7427967 mein start war sehr gut ich konnte meine f hrung in meinem stint immer weiter ausbauen
7427968 ich h tte zwar gerne wieder auf dem siegertreppchen gestanden aber in der meisterschaft haben wir noch zehn punkte vorsprung n chstes wochenende werden wir in detroit wieder angreifen und unsere f hrung hoffentlich weiter ausbauen
7427969 ich bin bergl cklich erneut auf dem podium zu stehen dieses ergebnis zeigt wie gut das team arbeitet
7427970 meine boxenmannschaft hat uns heute wieder einmal super schnell abgefertigt den mechanikern verdanken wir einen gro en teil unseres heutigen erfolges
7427971 aus einem noch zu analysierenden grund ist die kraftstoffstrategie beim rs spyder mit startnummer sieben heute nicht aufgegangen das m ssen und werden wir genauestens berpr fen
7427972 abgesehen von dieser panne haben die porsche teams heute eine tolle leistung gezeigt die boxenstopps waren extrem schnell und die fahrer haben einen tollen job gemacht
7427973 wir sind unglaublich stolz das war spektakul rster sport in einer ausverkauften location nachdem die komplette wasserski anlage gestern nacht kn cheltief unter wasser stand und heute morgen um vier der mast des wasserski lifts im wasser lag h tte ich nicht gedacht dass wir heute eine solch gro artige und stressfreie session erleben ein gro es kompliment an wasserski hamburg und christian von lerchenfeld dessen team innerhalb von acht stunden unm gliches m glich machte das war ein echtes wunder

7427976 al qaeda is the mother of the holy war in somalia
7427977 most of our leaders were trained in al qaeda camps
7427978 we will take our orders from sheik osama bin laden because we are his students
7427979 al qaeda is the mother of the holy war in somalia
7427980 most of our leaders were trained in al qaeda camps we get our tactics and guidelines from them many have spent time with osama bin laden
7427981 there are indications of a fairly close shabab al qaeda connection though its not clear to what extent theyve been operationalized
7427982 is shabab taking orders from al qaeda i would say no they are still running their own show
7427983 once we end the holy war in somalia we will take it to any government that participated in the fighting against somalia or gave assistance to those attacking us
7427984 and they cant afford to do that because the clans provide their foot soldiers
7427985 they are still a threat but clearly their network and operations have been degraded
7427986 its just a coincidence that its bobble day for me that it happened but its nice to have that many fans out there and win a ball game like that
7427987 i was planning on swinging at that fastball but i saw rickie take off so i figured id take it let him get to second scoring position
7427988 split finger i think he hung it a little bit and it found a hole for me
7427989 you just had the feeling getting out of that jam right there we were going to win the ball game in the bottom half of the inning
7427990 it would be mad to base too many judgements on the strength of just one match or even two
7427991 the league wont settle down until about christmas and it will be time to re evaluate things then if we stay strong we can stay in the running
7427992 weve got to assemble a team now and see where we are after the transfer window closes next week you must stay confident it is no good telling yourself you cant win this cant win that
7427993 given the right situations i think we will still do well there are a lot of teams who can do well this season and we hope we are one of them

7428092 hey wait a minute dont we have to extend remoteserviceservlet
7428093 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7428094 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7428095 obviously the ultimate goal is for labs to avoid having to use animals altogether eventually
7428096 it is showing the model we use explaining how we go about making it and how these skin equivalents are used to guide and minimise the use of animals when we develop new wound healing therapies
7428097 we collect skin donated by consenting patients who have had surgery resulting in a surgical off cut and the skin is then processed in our laboratory to isolate the cells once they are growing healthily again we can bring them back together and create the multi component skin equivalent in the lab
7428098 theres a huge traffic snarl on nh 2 because of the trinamool congress agitation several long distance vehicles coming from other states were diverted
7428099 we dont accept this claim that the traffic jam was caused because of our political programme we are constantly allowing all emergency vehicles through the durgapur expressway but we would request people to kindly bear with us during this crucial point of our movement
7428100 it was a reiteration of the governments policy to continue its brutal war on muslims
7428101 the indian state too has targeted muslims branding them terrorist after 9 11 and the indian parliament attack muslims were targeted once again our party is willing to unite in a broad front with all the genuine democratic forces which would be willing to fight back the hindu fascist offensive
7428102 i think there is a world market for maybe 5 computers
7428103 ive lived by this river since i was born but im so afraid of it now as the river has changed its character a lot from the old days
7428104 my house will be swept away within a few years if there is no levee to combat the erosion
7428105 we are scared earthquakes are so frequent in china and we are afraid the quakes will one day break up the dams if that happens the huge volume of water from the bursting dams released into the mekong would kill us
7428106 sometimes i cant even find enough fish to serve my customers
7428107 the water level has been rising and falling very quickly over the past few years we have seen the river doing so every three days which is unusual
7428108 it would be foolish not to aspire to even greater heights especially as the host nation
7428109 sure weve got to see whether or not it is feasible to move to third place we havent made a decision on that
7428110 but this is not a national organising committee which is going to sit on its laurels and nor are the athletes we will want to make sure that we deliver the best for britain in 2012 so we are going to be looking to go higher
7428111 if you had asked me this two weeks ago i would have said impossible
7428112 the phrase we used was fourth in the medals is the best we can hope to achieve given a nation of our size
7428113 but we look at these games and what has happened to the russians if they are in reach then theres no reason to constrain our ambitions
7428114 in terms of 2012 nobody is going to be happy with the same again but we need to be bringing that to life probably through more medals
7428115 obviously we can look forward to whats in front of us
7428116 being able to sweep baltimore definitely puts us in a much better situation against boston
7428117 i have a bunch of guys that just gave their hearts and souls to that game and i hope you understand that
7428118 i wish i would have had about 15 more minutes to sit out there with my team instead of come out here as quickly as i did thats how tough it is for me to process
7428119 i was trying to go down and away i didnt execute the pitch and big league hitters thats what theyre supposed to do
7428120 this was a big game we knew we had a chance to sweep and any time you can do that you have to take advantage of it especially where we are right now
7428121 its always nice to come home and were going to have an important series at home
7428122 weve just got to keep doing what weve been doing
7428123 when you lose the first two games of a series i think youre going to have a quick hook with anybody
7428124 it was like i never pitched before im disgusted with my outing
7428125 the fact that he stayed in and played that game is and it might be a little overdramatic but i thought he grew up a little bit today
7428126 i dont mean like he had to but he understood where we were physically with the rest of our team and what he can do by staying in the game i thought that was huge
7428127 he hit his shoulder he hit his head he cut his eye the hard thing we were struggling with that stuff from the warning track and his contact popped out and he couldnt get the contact to stay in so thats where we were really struggling so hes sore
7428128 i knew i was closing in on the fence just going to make the catch and i hit the wall pretty good
7428129 didnt feel good ill tell you that it was just one of those things where you just try to play
7428130 ive hit the wall before making plays it was kind of more my shoulder that got the brunt of the wall it was one of those things where you just dont want to do damage if you stay in with your shoulder so you just have to make a quick call whether its worth staying in or not
7428131 im not pointing a finger at ellsbury because i think hes a pretty tough kid i guess my point is youre not always going to be 100 percent
7428132 we havent heard about a day for his release but were looking forward to it
7428133 the minute you make a mistake vernon wells hits it 400 feet
7428134 i think he was ok he competed sometimes balls bounce different directions
7428135 i pitched well and our entire bullpen did a great job that was a big win for us
7428136 i knew two was going to be it for me
7428137 i couldnt do that id love to but we cant do that
7428138 if were going to win this were going to need everybody and today we had everybody
7428139 everything we did today was possible because of the way we pitched
7428140 that was a big situation right there and manny did the job
7428141 thats exciting to see us pitch like that out of the bullpen we need to do that
7428142 you want to get in there and throw strikes and try to get ahead of the hitters and hopefully you come out of it with a win
7428143 any time you go out there in that situation its huge jonathan had pitched two innings and the game kept going on and it fell on me to do what jonathan usually does hes the best there is in the game so you always have big shoes to fill when youre in there in his role but we dont get to me unless jonathan pitches like he did today
7428144 ive caught guys in the bullpen who had nothing and then they go out and strike out the side
7428145 its usually hard to tell i think all of our guys threw the ball well in the bullpen i didnt catch everybody out of there today so i cant say i had first hand knowledge but i didnt hear any complaints from anyone and thats usually a good sign
7428146 if you dont in that situation you go home well take a win any way we can get it
7428147 my heart bleeds we are paying more for fuel than virtually any other country despite having our own reserves in the north sea it is one thing to be taken for a fool by the power companies quite another when it is by analysts such as yourselves

7428156 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7428157 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7428158 obviously the ultimate goal is for labs to avoid having to use animals altogether eventually
7428159 it is showing the model we use explaining how we go about making it and how these skin equivalents are used to guide and minimise the use of animals when we develop new wound healing therapies
7428160 we collect skin donated by consenting patients who have had surgery resulting in a surgical off cut and the skin is then processed in our laboratory to isolate the cells once they are growing healthily again we can bring them back together and create the multi component skin equivalent in the lab
7428161 you mean to tell me you paid to see stormy weather thirty eight times

7428166 finding artefacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
7428167 im not downplaying the importance of it any time you have a day off youre going to handle your pitching a little bit different anyway but weve gotten to a point in the season where every game is important
7428168 weve come out of this place with some tough losses i dont think we would have quit or hung our heads that doesnt worry me but it was a great win
7428169 a few of us were talking its probably a lot bigger than just a regular season win given the way these guys are playing theyre trying to catch up to us and theyve got the pitching to do it those guys right now theyre hitting to get down early the way a j burnetts been pitching it could have been a long day but pedey comes out boom
7428170 its obviously a big thrill especially this time of the year cause every win counts for so much
7428171 its one win but every one counts so much more right now
7428172 ellsbury looked like he just got done with a 15 round fight bay made a leaping catch off the wall i think we set a good tone today with this win and hopefully we can carry that over through new york
7428173 that was one of the funnest games ive been a part of in a long time

7428185 more than half of the 1 439 daily newspapers in the u s wont exist in print e paper or web formats by the end of next decade they will go out of business the few national dailies will have diminished but continuing existences via the web and e paper but not in print the first dailies to expire will be the regional dailies which have already begun to implode those plus a very many smaller dailies most of whose circulations are steadily evaporating will decline to levels at which they will no longer be economically viable to publish daily further layoffs of staffs by those newspapers companies cannot avoid this fate not so long as daily circulations and readerships continually and increasingly decline
7428186 adding multimedia convergence interactivity web 2 0 and citizen journalism to what their newspapers have always done arent cures but merely balms and accessories the absences of multimedia or interactivity arent why the circulations and readerships of american daily newspapers have been declining in relation to both population and households for more than three decades half of american newspapers declines in weekday circulation and readership relative to population occurred before the internet opened to the public in late 1991 prior to popular awareness of interactivity or multimedia
7428187 american newspaper companies have failed to adapt their core product to a radical change in consumers supply of news and information during the past 15 years
7428188 too many of those companies have deviated from their local roots
7428189 the deaths of large numbers of daily newspapers in the u s wont cause a new dark age but will certainly cause a gray age for american journalism during the next decade much local and regional news wont see the light of publication

7428215 obviously businesspeople are concerned and are closely monitoring events but business activity goes on as usual
7428216 these things have happened before and you just take them in stride
7428217 the benefits you stand to gain from doing business in mindanao still far exceed the risks you factor into locating here

7428226 the failure of members of both houses of congress to consult the people on charter change will cause a more serious conflict than that generated by the lack of consultation
7428227 the claim by certain congressmen that there is no need to consult their constituents because they were voted representatives of the people is not only the height of arrogance but is absolutely misleading since they were voted to pass or amend laws but not to amend the constitution
7428228 deciding on the mode of amending the constitution without knowing how many and which provisions will be amended coming at the heels of the presidential announcement supporting charter change is nothing more than a signal that the presidents allies in the congress are ready to change the constitution despite lack of consultation with and objections from the people

7428263 im one day from disowning the record in the morning i can talk about it as part of my past for months people have been asking me what the new record is like ive told them i dont know im too close to it as of tomorrow maybe i can start answering
7428264 i will say this our contribution to popular culture this time around is a very very strong one
7428265 look i cant watch it i dont even talk about it it brings me back to that time and it wasnt a good time for me and i never wanted that movie to come out in the first place i feel like its an albatross around our neck i hope this new album will come out and make it clear that weve moved on were much more unified and mature

7428272 hes no mediator there is no wobble in what he says if me and hetfield butt heads he will listen and say this is right thats wrong one time we played something new and he didnt like it that makes me want to

7428279 its powerful music and i have to say my inspiration this time is my kids i have a 2 year old and a 5 week old
7428280 i will not tell you how many brigades we have now

7428285 mccain is so concerned that the democratic ticket isnt as strong as hed like that he spent his own money on an attack ad that hillary clinton was passed over by barack obama for his vice president selection mccain even claims to know obamas thinking in the matter surprising for a man so confused he cant even remember how many homes he owns that mccain has such precise insight into his rivals thoughts
7428286 im not afraid the police are going to get out of control things have been smooth sailing here sunday and the police on downtown streets arent dressed in riot gear like they were in boston
7428287 for all the ink spilled over this last week two related issues were underexplored the latter of which is especially important whats
7428288 senator obama the country is depending on you to bring pragmatism and competency back to the oval office please follow through on your promise to govern for the middle class the middle class drove the spectacular success the u s enjoyed for so many years
7428289 breathe early and often no doubt youve been breathing all your life and have gotten fairly good at it but here in the mile high city the first key to feeling good throughout your visit is to breathe a little more deeply and more often than your usual rate
7428290 i have been targeting dap for 20 years and they have been talking about consistency transparency accountability and the need to establish a non race based party
7428291 i feel much more comfortable with dap and i trust the people around me i joined dap for what it stands for a party that has been very consistent with its beliefs

7428302 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7428303 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7428304 i wrote that song no 1 fan as a stalker it was raining and i was sitting there in front of the house watching her come home from a date after we were divorced
7428305 i was a mess in some ways and that had nothing to do with my choice of career
7428306 i was the luckiest girl in the world when i got the princess diaries films but all the driven behaviour that you need to be successful as a teenager didnt help me when it came to my private life and social situations

7428322 okay i called my wife a cunt but i never called her a cunt when i was a prisoner of war
7428323 i ran over that mexican pool boy on my way over here but its okay because i ran over people when i was a prisoner of war
7428324 i was a prisoner of war when i was a prisoner of war so lay off me okay
7428325 my favorite tv show when i was a prisoner of war was the prisoner
7428326 there were no uppity negroes with aspirations of being president when i was a prisoner of war so anything i might say that is offensive to that colored boy with the big ears is excused because guess what i was a prisoner of war
7428327 i stiffed that waitress because i need the money i would have tipped her to make a mortgage payment on one of my homes and because i was a prisoner of war
7428328 it was supposed to be my time to be president because ive been a loyal republican ever since i was a prisoner of war and because i used to be a prisoner of war

7428339 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that

7428342 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7428343 i think the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7428344 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7428345 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
7428346 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
7428347 what works and what needs correction and thus leverage our considerable member base to influence sap to either change the costs or change the offerings as appropriate
7428348 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this time
7428349 especially from small to medium size businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support
7428350 russia will continue to enforce the peace in this area our troops are withdrawing no one will be allowed to put armor or heavy artillery in this area ever again as the map clearly shows we russia are in total control
7428351 russia is pulling out on its terms and at its pace
7428352 if we the zionists cannot have it all no one will have it
7428353 russia believes that from now on only russian armed forces have the right to perform the peacekeeping duties in the conflict zone they have consistently and accurately complied with the 1992 bilateral agreement by violating its mandate georgia no longer has the right to participate in the peacekeeping mission
7428354 us and nato military installations on the territory of former soviet central asian republics are instrumental in providing logistics support for multi national forces and their operations as is known the united states and nato have reliably asserted themselves at uzbek kirghiz and tajik bases i e manas bishkek karshi kulyab kokaidy and termez all these airfields were to have been used for re supply missions for transporting humanitarian relief aid and for deploying search and rescue units however the first few french mirage 2000 fighters have landed in manas not so long ago until then reconnaissance aircraft including predator drones used to operate rather actively from all bases in the interests of the us nato air force formation being used against al qaeda units moreover ranger units awacs type aircraft psychological warfare and reconnaissance planes were deployed there

7428372 adesso basta tutta questa storia mi sta rovinando il mio matrimonio sta andando in crisi a causa di questo scandalo di sesso e quindi faccio un passo indietro non denuncer il professor tappero per molestie sessuali ora voglio pensare alla mia famiglia ai miei figli e a mio marito che potete capire sta passando un momento difficile per noi sono giorni delicati per tutte le cose che sono state dette e scritte tanti dettagli sono stati caricati ed enfatizzati
7428373 non volevo fare scoppiare una bomba come questa ero gi contenta di aver vinto contro il tar che ha annullato il concorso per motivi formali invece sono stata ingannata sono stata colta alla sprovvista qualcuno ha sfruttato la mia rabbia sono stata stupida e ingenua in realt con il mio avvocato avevamo pensato di presentare denuncia solo dopo il nuovo concorso in medicina legale sono sicura che lo avrei vinto sono preparata e il sogno della mia vita frequentare quella specializzazione invece adesso mi sembra tutto compromesso sono stata travolta da questa storia
7428374 e vero lho cercato girava voce che avesse rilasciato dichiarazioni infamanti nei miei confronti cose vergognose e false che non posso rivelare volevo che si fermasse che mi chiedesse scusa pubblicamente
7428375 s lo so mi ha convocata come persona informata sui fatti a lui racconter tutto non ho niente da nascondere io non ho cercato lo scandalo sessuale non ho fatto querele io ho cercato solo il tar e lho vinto ci sono altre donne disposte a combattere contro i concorsi truccati sullaspetto sessuale invece molto pi complicato perch entrano in gioco le famiglie gli affetti non tutte ce la fanno
7428376 io dico solo che ho il forte sospetto che un compito sia stato rifatto e una mia supposizione ho detto la verit ma ripeto ho scelto di non denunciare nessuno se qualcuno lo far nei miei confronti risponder e mi difender con i denti
7428377 perch lultima volta che il professor tappero mi ha chiesto di chinare la testa ed essere carina nei suoi confronti eravamo sulla mia renault megane azzurra proprio davanti allingresso dellistituto io mi sono rifiutata ero incinta di mio marito non mi andava l crollato il mio sogno di diventare medico legale pochi giorni dopo ho perso il bambino ero al quarto mese quello che successo mi ha molto stressata
7428378 sul mio conto si stanno dicendo cose pesantissime ma quello che mi d pi fastidio il fango contro luniversit non voglio entrare nel merito degli aspetti personali qualsiasi cosa dicessi sarebbe veramente sgradevole
7428379 the use of arya would be self defeating in its purpose of bringing up before our people stretching from himalayas to kanyakumari irrespective of all denominations past and present
7428380 so the word bharatya too likely to mislead us when we want to denote our particular scociety we find the name sapta sindhu in the oldest records of the world the rig veda itself as an epithet applied to our land and our people and its is also well know the syllable s in sanskrit is at times changed to h as some of our prakrit languages and even in european languages
7428381 the word hindu is formed with the letter hi from the himalayas and induindu sarovar the southern ocean conveying the entire stretch of our motherland
7428382 after the death of mohammed pygamber his followers poured out from arabstan in waves after waves with their swords dripping with blood and overran vast portion as of the globe trampling under their feet all the various empires that lay in their path iran egypt rome europe and all others up to china the same tides of fanatic fury dashed also against the shores of hindustan our people braved the onslaughts relentlessly for over hundred years and instead of being sucked up ultimately succeeded in crushing completely the forces of enemy
7428383 ever since that evil day when moslems first landed in huindustan right to the present moment the hindu nation has been gallantly fighting on to shake off the despoilers

7428400 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character

7428407 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7428408 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7428409 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7428410 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7428411 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7428412 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7428413 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7428414 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7428415 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7428416 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7428417 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7428418 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7428419 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7428420 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7428421 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7428422 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7428423 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7428424 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7428425 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7428426 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7428427 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7428430 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7428431 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7428432 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7428433 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7428434 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7428435 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7428436 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7428437 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio

7428439 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7428440 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7428441 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7428442 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7428443 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
7428444 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
7428445 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7428446 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7428447 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
7428448 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7428449 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7428450 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7428452 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7428453 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7428454 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7428455 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7428456 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7428457 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7428458 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

7428464 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7428465 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7428466 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7428467 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7428468 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7428469 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7428494 the coupling between the lhc applications and the operating system is very strong
7428495 by distributing these applications as virtual appliances we are able to isolate the application from the underlying desktop or laptop operating system allowing the researchers to run the applications on systems that normally would not be supported
7428496 for a proof of concept anybody can just configure a virtual machine vm image by hand
7428497 but providing appliance management and maintenance that will scale to many thousands of appliances and that will be truly interoperable between different resource providers requires a new approach

7428499 you cant change your whole philosophy on how you run and expect it to just click overnight
7428500 the good thing for us is we have our bye week early this year sept 28 and thats typically when you start to see the running game take off when you have a new scheme in
7428501 certainly were not going to just accept that but i think thats what ive seen during my years in the league
7428502 when you dont play a 3 4 defense a lot
7428503 it can be a little more difficult because it presents different blocking angles and a basis for how they attack you
7428504 its got to get better its got to be more consistent
7428505 we had a couple that broke in addition to smiths touchdown calhoun had a run of 40 yards which is good
7428506 but what i want is punishment i want to punish the defense
7428507 i want to take their legs out of them so they cant rush
7428508 we have to keep punishing the ball up inside and then theyll defend it and then we have a chance to use the big guys receivers outside
7428509 we gave away too many outs you cant let that kind of game get away
7428510 i think you lose credibility with people if you starting saying were going to still win this thing
7428511 but playing hard and grinding it out thats automatic as bad a player as i was i could still hustle im not worried about that at all
7428512 this is a tough time of year you have to push yourself even at that youre whistling dixie if you think that teams as good as the white sox and twins have been are going to lose eight or nine in a row thats not going to happen
7428513 its very unlikely both of them are going to go into some fantastic funk
7428514 i would love to get that record im not going to lie to you
7428515 in the meantime its something i cant control weve got a long way to go and im still looking forward to getting some more opportunities
7428516 all the work i put into it i think its paid off
7428517 a lot of times when teams go through what theyve gone through the hungry players get a chance to prove themselves those are dangerous teams
7428518 but cleveland is going to be right back in the thick of things next year hopefully well be the same way
7428519 hell be pitching against guys like grady sizemore he doesnt have to get cliff lee out
7428520 but on the other side he has to get more aggressive in rbi situations
7428521 i felt i threw only one bad slider out of six and i know what i did wrong on the bad one
7428522 he has about 250 at bats and about 40 rbi
7428523 if he gets 400 at bats knocks in 70 runs and catches well thats a very valuable guy but you can see the toll that catching takes on a guy
7428524 him and i will be linked forever because of that one play and now theres two plays
7428525 so soll sicher gestellt werden dass es weltweit nur einen besitzer f r die freiheitsstatue gibt

7428609 olympic athletes have to display an unnatural and it has to be said wholly unhealthy level of self discipline in the build up to big competitions how else is this going to manifest itself than with a volcanic release of pent up hedonism
7428610 a common sight to see recently knocked out athletes gorging on magnums and mcdonalds swilling alcohol and of course shagging like crazy
7428611 it is unbelievable in there everyone is totally crazy once they are out of their competitions
7428612 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
7428613 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed

7428619 the newspaper is of the view that musharraf proved a poor leader he may have been the best bet for assistance in the war on terror at the time the us sought those ties but his forced resignation leaves quite a political mess
7428620 it will have to be seen if the two of them can govern together or whether they were only able to co operate when battling musharraf
7428621 internationally pakistans blind eye towards terrorists could have fatal consequences for the us and its allies
7428622 if sharif and zardari are to succeed where musharraf could not they have to put aside their petty differences they have to gain the support of the army which though demoralised remains the most powerful force in pakistan they have to convince chief of army staff ashfaq kayani that corralling the isi is important not just for americas priority the war on terror but also for the stability of pakistan and they have to trust general kayani a one time head of the isi to do his job
7428623 as musharraf exits pakistan needs a revivified military and strong civilian rule if it is to quell the havoc caused by al qaeda the us needs all of that too

7428657 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7428658 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7428659 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7428660 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7428661 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7428662 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7428663 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7428664 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7428665 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7428666 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7428667 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7428668 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7428669 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7428670 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7428671 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7428672 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7428673 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7428674 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7428675 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7428676 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7428677 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7428678 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7428679 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7428680 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7428681 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7428682 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7428683 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7428684 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7428685 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7428686 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7428687 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7428688 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7428689 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7428690 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7428691 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7428692 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7428693 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7428694 this is a planning took where all things are going
7428695 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7428696 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7428697 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7428698 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7428699 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7428700 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7428701 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7428702 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7428703 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7428704 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7428705 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7428706 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7428707 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7428708 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7428709 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7428710 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7428711 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7428712 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7428713 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7428714 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7428715 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7428716 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7428717 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7428718 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7428719 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7428720 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7428721 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7428722 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7428723 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7428724 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7428725 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7428726 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7428727 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7428728 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7428729 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7428730 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7428731 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7428732 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7428733 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7428734 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7428735 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7428736 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7428737 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7428738 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7428739 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7428740 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7428741 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7428742 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7428743 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7428744 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7428745 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7428746 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7428747 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7428748 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7428749 we took the bacon down to one day a week
7428750 its just something everyone loves you walk in schools and smell that bacon frying and the kids go crazy
7428751 its time for a change i may be old but i am an old person who believes in young ideas
7428752 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7428753 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7428754 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7428755 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7428756 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee
7428757 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings

7428760 i am lodging a civil damages claim against all those parties that branded me a criminal including the psl black aces safa and some sections of the media among others
7428761 the police with whom the case was first reported to are not prosecuting me but i have already been judged to be a criminal before the police had even finished their investigations
7428762 had the football authorities waited for the police investigations then they would have made an informed decision about the whole matter
7428763 gert and muhsin had a one on one conversation and then put everything that happened last season under the carpet
7428764 ertugral told gert what he expected him to do this season and gert has grabbed his opportunity with both hands and that is why he has managed to remain so consistent
7428765 it is good to see the player giving 101 percent commitment on the field i am sure that if he keeps this up he will soon be knocking on bafana bafanas door
7428766 they then radioed their office who told them to drive straight to the police station

7428776 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7428777 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here to pay their respects

7428779 erano circa un ventina di uomini armati hanno prima sparato sui mezzi e poi li hanno incendiati
7428780 there was unanimity in the decision to postpone the event until october next year appeasement wasnt part of the meeting at all
7428781 there was a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7428782 the pakistan cricket board have been extremely reasonable about the whole subject they have worked jolly hard to try to give comfort to the member boards and the eight teams that are touring that it would be safe and secure
7428783 had the decision been made a month ago im sure the tournament would be taking place in sri lanka but the amount of time it took the participating nations to come to their decision not to attend has reduced the time between now and the start of the tournament it was just impossible to relocate and stage a world class tournament
7428784 the ecb supports the decision of the icc to postpone the champions trophy until october 2009
7428785 the ecb made it clear to icc chief executive haroon lorgat at a meeting at lords last week that the ecb had a duty to care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised
7428786 the ecb explained their reservations and security concerns about staging the tournament in the aftermath of the resignation of the pakistan president pervez musharraf last monday these concerns were shared by four other competing countries at yesterdays teleconference the ecb recognises the outstanding efforts of the pakistan cricket board in attempting to mitigate the risks surrounding the champions trophy and i will be meeting with the incoming chairman of the pcb once an appointment is made to discuss ways that our two boards can work together in the future
7428787 players voiced their concerns from all around the world all the players i know personally from other countries have expressed their concerns in terms of safety and security it was good that it was taken out of our players hands
7428788 over the last couple of weeks it has been a huge topic of conversation in the dressing room and last sundays briefing was a huge talking point this whole week theres been ifs and buts and dos and donts what i said to the team was to put it to the back of our minds because the most important thing for us is the one day series with south africa and that means standing up to be counted on tuesday this is a huge decision and cricket can now take priority again
7428789 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7428790 you know i lost i lost big time in boston
7428791 in light of mr gerhartsreiters history of deceitful behavior any statements made by him should be viewed with extreme skepticism
7428792 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7428793 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7428794 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7428795 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables
7428796 i realize we are up against a deadline and it will be difficult to meet at this time but ive been meeting with the developers and im encouraged
7428797 we cant sell the bonds if the market does not want it the market is calling the shots
7428798 im confident steel point is a sure bet over the long run the market will turn around there is money to be made here

7428822 i dont think it is me who did anything wrong they should have been investigating adrian
7428823 i was the race leader and he was lapped so he should have given way to me anyway
7428824 there was nothing for him to gain because he would let me go by on the track so it was unnecessary in the pitlane
7428825 i am so glad and so happy to be able to be here like this after such a bad result in hungary
7428826 the car was great especially in the second stint and the team were great too to take pole position to win the race and to have the fastest lap you cannot ask for more after such a result in budapest
7428827 i have had flu symptoms and a fever nearly every day i had low energy and i had problems with spasms in my neck
7428828 pedro de la rosa the teams test and reserve driver was on standby but i managed to get through it even though it was tough
7428829 i felt like i couldnt drive it i lost the steering a lot for two corners before it came back and i lost some confidence in the car
7428830 so i am glad to be third it is a good result for the team
7428831 it is an issue for us because we have had some problems in the first race in the last one and in this one
7428832 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7428833 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7428834 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counsellor on international crises that might come up
7428835 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7428836 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 cast iron damage proof
7428837 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7428838 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7428839 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7428840 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7428841 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a us open
7428842 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7428843 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7428844 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7428845 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7428846 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7428847 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7428848 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7428849 our reception of the prisoners tomorrow will be like a national wedding

7428851 august 23 2008 could easily go down as a defining date in the revival of australian rugby
7428852 the importance of the wallabies first triumph on south african soil in eight exasperating seasons cannot be overstated
7428853 have disconsolately headed back to sydney with nothing to show from their african adventures
7428854 admittedly the auckland test loss was a serious blow to the wallabies but what was so rousing on saturday was that they made dramatic improvements in all of the areas that let them down against the all blacks
7428855 while it is still too early to compare the 2008 side with the golden wallabies of 1998 2001 robbie deans team is showing similar traits
7428856 australias 27 15 win against the springboks has confirmed this team has the self belief which is the hallmark of great sides
7428857 the manner in which the wallabies controlled the game and then showed composure when the springboks made a late run was encouraging
7428858 only when the wallabies walk off suncorp stadium september 13 after the bledisloe cup match can we make an accurate and balanced assessment of the new regime
7428859 now in the middle of one of the toughest road trips in rugby successive test matches in south africa theres measured optimism that at least we have not regressed

7428864 its clear we are well positioned for 2008 and beyond regardless of the business environment we are surrounded by
7428865 if we were to classify people based on aptitude they are as bs cs and ds because of globalization the cs and ds have been outsourced theyre gone all thats left is you you are now in competition with a bunch of as and bs you are now clamoring for attention amongst a talented group of people how do you now get noticed how can you shine and be recognized for additional opportunities how can you be successful when everyone around you is just as talented or more so than you if everyone around you is capable and of a or b caliber how do you compete with that
7428866 i remember that networking engineer that i met at that conference shed be a good candidate for this opportunity
7428867 to presume kennedy is coming and make preparations on the basis of him coming
7428868 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7428869 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7428870 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7428871 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7428872 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7428873 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7428874 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7428875 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7428876 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7428877 world economic growth in 2009 is likely to be the slowest since 2003
7428878 every world regions growth is expected to slow next year and the list of countries in or near recession is expanding
7428879 the us in my view will now have to come to grips with a much slower growth trajectory with real gdp growth likely to slow from the 3 2 trend of the past 13 years to no higher than 2 over the next 2 3 years or longer
7428880 so here at the risk of making my job less exciting are a dozen reasons why the eurozone economic malaise might have been exaggerated and why we could even see positive signs in the coming months
7428881 however hopes that the global tide for rates is turning and many central banks will embark on a major easing path are greatly exaggerated in our view

7428886 theyve made every economy they can in production with computers and so on
7428887 now theyre going to have to reduce costs in journalism and things are going to deteriorate tremendously
7428888 a news story published in a newspaper is on average touched or edited by 8 3 people that is ridiculous

7428901 no nos gustar a que poniendo esas hip tesis encima de la mesa lo nico que el gobierno est haciendo es jugar al despiste hacer maniobras de dilaci n para encubrir su voluntad pol tica de acometer esta reforma que equipare los procedimientos electorales en el exterior con el interior

7428936 tonight we come to the end of sixteen glorious days which we will cherish forever through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7428937 in all my decades at the post this is the first event ive covered at which i was certain that the main point of the exercise was to co opt the western media including nbc with a splendidly pretty sparsely attended completely controlled sports event inside a quasi military compound we had little alternative but to be a conduit for happy olympics progressive china propaganda i suspect it worked
7428938 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7428947 if it was a regular season game he probably would have played but we felt it was best not to play there was no point in jeopardizing him tonight
7428948 hopefully those guys will both be back and get some practice time next week
7428949 well see how it goes we thought hed be good enough to play tonight and wasnt i know he wants to get some time he was very disappointed
7428950 he was really looking forward to this one but we told him weve got more games to play hopefully he can go thursday
7428951 we had a chance to get back in it but the turnovers on our part really kind of took the wind out of our sails and defensively we couldnt force any
7428952 luckily we play again thursday so we can come out and change everything and get a win
7428953 obviously you come in and you want to win with us losing i think there were some good things in there some younger guys played well we got a lot of reps from the veterans thats whats going to help us in the long run
7428954 i guess quinn must have looked off the safety i had single coverage on the corner i had a deep post and he just threw a good ball
7428955 i just ran into the end zone hoping no one caught me
7428956 it was one of those days where we just didnt get the job done
7428957 it was a little disappointing but well bounce back weve got a short week and weve got to get ready for cincinnati and get ready to get our roster cut down next week
7428958 were still not thrilled we still have things to work on were not there yet but its preseason we still have two weeks of practice to get it there i think well be fine once we get to the regular season and its live and it really counts
7428959 you cant lose confidence we know we have things we have to work on as a unit we have to gel and continue to get better as a unit i think we will theres no doubt in my mind the type of people we have in this locker room and this organization well be able to get that done
7428960 just to be able to be part of that it was electric
7428961 it was real fun it was real good for the fans and for the players
7428962 it was great the fans and the excitement they displayed for the new stadium was great weve been on the road in the first three preseason games and now were at home to be in front of our fans adds a lot of excitement
7428963 obviously the stadium is state of the art and a great place to play
7428964 it was a preseason game and it was packed in there its exciting to see the fans and theyre definitely excited about it were looking forward to an excellent year hopefully we can build upon the rca dome and keep things going

7428969 i got in there and made a few tackles and ran around a little bit
7428970 conditioning i feel great physically i feel great mentally i feel great im definitely ready
7428971 both were out there making plays as usual dwight had a couple of good rushers and we did good in the running game
7428972 both of those guys built some confidence in themselves coming back and they played effectively in their first outing
7428973 it was good to be out there playing football like im used to
7428974 me getting back in there and getting that chemistry with the guys i think is the most important thing
7428975 both of those guys went in and played and came through it well and did some good things out there dwight had a couple of pressures on the quarterback and played his 18 to 20 plays and played well
7428976 i think bob got back in the flow of things and did a good job also
7428977 always the first time you get back out on the field youre a little rusty
7428978 you want to make some tackles you want to run around and see how your conditioning is its getting back into it i think once we get going and the season kicks off well get back in rhythm and get back to ourselves
7428979 it was a huge boost just to have them out there
7428980 its great to see those two guys who work hard and are great players and who love football to have them back on the field was huge
7428981 at the same time we still had some other key guys out once we get everybody out there i think well be back to colts ball

7428983 this was targeting the super rich in australia as not many people here no matter how much money they have would want to fork out that much money on a car they can only drive on private tracks

7428991 the continuous correction in future prices after touching historic high of almost rs 10 000 per quintal in the spot market mainly pulled coriander prices

7428994 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7428995 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7428996 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7428997 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7428998 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7428999 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions

7429030 i think we accept that it is unlikely you will see a games on this size and scale and stature again
7429031 the ioc in 2001 reached the conclusions that the focus must be much more on sustainability that big is not necessarily better
7429032 beijing has been very good the venues were superb the planning was clearly in place we knew the city would dress for a games embrace the biggest show on earth
7429033 but i like to think that london had it not already been the iocs blueprint would have instinctively got there to remain relevant the games must go on providing benefits long after the show has left town
7429034 there is no possible justification for leaving a second 80 000 seater stadium in london
7429035 the temporary nature of over 55 000 of those seats built on five rings means you can be very creative the way you wrap it with moving images its actually very exciting for us
7429036 it will be under pinned by all the security you expect but also recognising that we want this to be a celebration in our own back yard thats the balance you are always striking
7429037 it was usually the hottest day of the year not all the students could come and we could just tell that wasnt working
7429038 we know the students are anxious about starting school in our sprawling building with a brand new schedule the uniqueness of our block schedule made this idea make sense
7429039 our goal is to help students adjust more easily and ease their anxiety we want to help them feel comfortable
7429040 we knew itd be easier for freshmen to find their way to their classes with 1 000 fewer people in the halls
7429041 parents have been delighted with the idea current students tell us they wish theyd had this day when they were freshmen

7429045 it is an extensive injury that takes considerable time i have heard it said four months but again probably each individual is somewhat different the doctors have told me that this will be a four month recovery
7429046 dr warren has convinced us that this repair will put him in great shape going forward and because of that we are certainly 100 percent behind the decision
7429047 we just hope that the surgery goes well and that it is a full recovery and that he is even better than ever shortly down the road
7429048 it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear but after listening to the explanation and dr
7429049 we have to do a great job of getting our players refocused and our thoughts on going forward
7429050 someone has already raised that today and i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time about anything
7429051 i am sure that general manager jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do what is best here at this point in time
7429052 i have not had a chance to talk to anyone i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi kiwanuka this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7429053 with the medical people last night saturday there was no attempt to not make us aware of the possible severity of the injury
7429054 it was just that obviously nothing had been done yet there was no mri they could not conduct a full exam and once that was conducted then the doctors felt very strongly about this choice of action
7429055 i dont have a whole lot of comment about it the only thing i have talked to michael about is his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7429056 the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach is all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7429057 we have four really good receivers on this team and we have a quarterback we like a veteran quarterback and were developing another
7429058 so that part i think were going to be fine but weve got to keep the hounds off him kitna
7429059 it was a panic thing because me and the receiver werent on the same page
7429060 it was just the cardinal sin dont throw it right over the middle
7429061 i have been here seven years now and would like to stay even longer
7429062 i love the fans the scottish people and the scottish league i love the club i adore the club
7429063 i would like to honour my contract until the end until the last day last minute second
7429064 at the end of the year i will have completed eight years at the club
7429065 my wish is to sign another two years at celtic but that will be hard if i dont fit into the coachs plans you never know in life things can change
7429066 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week

7429077 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
7429078 we knew it would be close on fuel at the end so we came in with two minutes to go for a quick splash and thought we could make it to the end we didnt put in more fuel because we did want to lose additional track position but the overall leading audi passed the start finish line just after the two hour 45 minute time limit so the whole field had to do another lap romain made to within 100 yards of the finish with the extra lap but he ran out of gas
7429079 im very happy that we got another podium in our first alms season i think it shows how amazingly the team works together and how good a package we have with a little bit more luck in finding the right race setup we could have had a chance to win the race but today the ferrari was just a little bit stronger i had to fight very hard to go the speed i went i couldnt do it over the whole stint but we can be happy with the result because everything went right for us
7429080 that was one of the toughest fights that i ever had in a race car i had to drive very defensively to make sure that the ferrari would not get by in doing that i got more and more tire pickup so at the end i was struggling quite a bit but we finished ahead of them in the points so thats all that counts its a little step but a step in the right direction

7429082 you dont need a gun i dont need a gun and i support gun control laws this isnt the wild west we have police for a reason
7429083 if someone were to break in to my home the alarm would go off and the police would arrive within 5 minutes the criminal will hear the alarm and be frightened away while i hide in the bathroom
7429084 it is indeed possible that the criminal will be frightened by your alarm but there are many cases where criminals choose to enter the home and a citizen had to either home defense gun and training to effectively use it can be purchased for under 500 and will provide a lifetime of security it seems prudent to own a gun for self defense purposes
7429085 i dont know how to fire a gun and i dont care to learn even if someone broke in i dont think i would be able to shoot them they would then take the gun from me and shoot me
7429086 you certainly have a right to choose not to own a gun however i have a right to own a gun and i know how to use it in self defense if that need were to arise which i hope it never does please respect my gun ownership rights just because you find guns to be scary doesnt mean that i do just because you would hesitate to shoot a home invader bent on harming you or your family doesnt mean that i would just as it would be wrong for me to try to force you through the legislative process to own a gun it would be wrong for you to try to take away my gun ownership rights

7429093 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure
7429094 we dont want to take any gloss away from what is our most important home assignment against india by playing against them so close to the series
7429095 one way or another someones going to get annoyed or offended if you take it seriously
7429096 when you live out here in northern california and you tell people youre doing an ad for mccain even if its an assignment for adweek you become the invisible man
7429097 one way or another someones going to get annoyed or offended if you take it seriously
7429098 when you live out here in northern california and you tell people youre doing an ad for mccain even if its an assignment for adweek you become the invisible man
7429099 rather than simply writing two executions on senator mccain and senator obama we decided to add a bit of this industrys context in the mix

7429101 obamaly has a funny name it is born of two continents and is largely untested great in the press gives fantastic conference and can inspire around the ideals of change and disruption

7429105 its morning again in america but its not too late to wake up
7429106 george w had 78 percent of the evangelical vote to kerrys 21 percent mccain should just choose god as his running mate hed cinch it
7429107 barack obama and john mccain have a lot in common
7429108 theyve both done a great job being simplistic candidates appealing to the hearts not the brains of the american voters
7429109 each in their own way standing proud for what they believe
7429110 mccain has used his experience in vietnam before for political gain so why not continue to do it
7429111 there are many americans who are undecided at this point and sympathy voters are ripe for the picking
7429112 americans ogle him like a celebrity more than a candidate and this seems to work for him
7429113 so forget hillary clinton and any other true politician for a running mate obama hilton thats the ticket
7429114 political ads are stunningly bad artless humorless small minded negative and formulaic
7429115 do what political advertising has done best which is to use prejudice bias and fear to great personal advantage
7429116 we didnt dig too deep for the two campaign strategies
7429117 we just did what most voters do we looked at pictures of the two candidates
7429118 two attributes sad but true that will cause certain people to vote against them
7429119 tens of millions of people will recognize their satirical quality and reevaluate how they consume political advertising
7429120 coming to the conclusion that maybe just maybe they should pay less attention to the half truths they see on commercials and think a little more for themselves
7429121 the ultimate negative ad reduced to an indelible visual that conjures up each candidates vulnerability youth for obama and age for mccain
7429122 the ads are negative but make you don a real un cindy mccain like toothy grin
7429123 when you raise existing doubts about a candidate with their own names its hard to not gore them with it
7429124 lightweight celebrity full of hot air floating above us all
7429125 this election is a major turning point well either turn towards the future or turn back the clock
7429126 you can relive some of the worst moments of the bush presidency reenacted by mccain
7429127 to allow influencers to embrace him on their own terms
7429128 wed simply start by inserting organizations local leaders causes communities churches and everyday people who represent what he stands for
7429129 by the time we were done people could see on several levels from work and community to personal what obama stands for
7429130 and that on one or several of those levels hes standing for them
7429131 the world is behind him the way colleges and high schools rally behind their local heroes
7429132 tell the rest of your taliban boys this mavericks cleaning house
7429133 if he can do that to the taliban imagine what he can do for the economy yes mccains a man of action who tells it like it is pull his string and hear a bit of good old fashioned american wisdom
7429134 its ok to eat what you want today it doesnt mean youre going to quit your diet
7429135 were tired of fay and glad it looks like shes gone
7429136 im sure well have to spend more the first thing is for sparc to do a review for government on how the actual targeting of the high performance and most likely medal winning sports actually went and then have a look at whats a realistic budget
7429137 i dont have a feeling for how much more but what i know is that to do well at the olympics you cant just be the gifted amateur
7429138 you do need that total focus you do need all the support that we can wrap around our athletes
7429139 we can never be totally happy the world is moving on in terms of performance and if we stay still we will get further behind so what that means is that in our review which will take place when we get back we have to look for another edge

7429200 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown workforce and the strong partnerships with the uaw and local and state officials
7429201 based on the quality of work and these strong partnerships we are pleased to announce our plans to invest another 500 million in the chevy cruze product program in the u s including more than 350 million in lordstown
7429202 the cruze will build on the already successful chevrolet cobalt cobalt xfe and cobalt ss all of which are nearly sold out in dealer showrooms
7429203 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
7429204 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
7429205 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment

7429207 the common refrain everywhere we went was where do we get these cars

7429330 parece que la cpi usa al continente como un caso para realizar pruebas para determinar en qu manera el derecho internacional puede obtener m s legitimidad en el terreno
7429331 la cpi se concentra en la debilidad econ mica y pol tica de pa ses vulnerables y en naciones que no son capaces o no est n dispuestas a juzgar a perpetradores de cr menes contra la humanidad muchos pa ses africanos entran en este criterio
7429332 tenemos que preguntarnos si el castigo es un disuasivo suficiente para aquellos que violan los derechos humanos la intervenci n de la cpi es suficiente para detener cr menes contra la humanidad y cr menes de guerra en frica o en cualquier parte del mundo
7429333 el tribunal tendr a que hacer responsables a todos los tiranos pero esto no ocurre hasta ahora la mayor a de los acusados son africanos los poderosos como por ejemplo estados unidos nunca ser n llevados a juicio

7429339 los casos que investiga la cpi en este momento fueron presentados por los propios estados parte excepto el de darfur que fue remitido por el consejo de seguridad de la onu por tanto no es verdad que el tribunal est concentrado solamente en frica pues la oficina del fiscal ha anunciado p blicamente que sigue de cerca la situaci n en otras partes del mundo por ejemplo en colombia y en afganist n

7429360 en los poemas de los sufis los m sticos del islam se habla muchas veces de borracheras pero esos excesos como los de los m sticos de otras tradiciones espirituales distintas tienen muy poco que ver con el alcohol y s mucho con el xtasis ellos siempre hablan de tabernas aluden sin lugar a dudas m s a la hermandad a la comunidad a la tariqa que a los garitos en s en ese sentido esta multaqa en rabe reuni n encuentro amistoso mueve el plumero en esas coordenadas m s a n porque este disco inspirado en los textos de los grandes sufis es un encuentro de m sicos de diversas procedencias razas y culturas es decir musulmanes cristianos jud os flamencos incluso agn sticos ja ja bajo la mirada eso s de alguien que mira al futuro a partir de lo mejor y m s bello del pasado
7429361 perhaps the best basketball i saw all summer was boynton and bradley going at each other in vegas
7429362 both have such competitive spirits and are just killer scorers the higher the stakes the more these guys want the ball in their hands they are also two of the best defenders in the class
7429363 bradleys defense certainly weighs in heavily in his ranking in its simplest form the game breaks down to scoring and not letting your opposition score bradley has a pretty good handle on dominating his man on both sides of the ball
7429364 snaer simply did it all in vegas and with a competitive attitude that bordered on nasty
7429365 we just hadnt seen that from him we knew he could score but we werent aware of his competitive instinct and his all around game now we know his capabilities
7429366 fontenla est utilizando minuto digital como altavoz de todas las corrientes de la derecha extrema o de ex activistas ultras reciclados en movimientos c vicos
7429367 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego
7429368 we got mouths to feed though gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
7429369 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7429370 hes got to be focused simple and clear rather than elegiac this is not a great novel this is a short clear focused discussion unless it is clear and real simple he has failed
7429371 obama certainly hasnt opened up any huge lead over in a year that should be an easy year for a democratic candidate
7429372 i think the country still wants to know who barack obama is and where he wants to take the country in a more specific direction than he has given
7429373 you cant lose the change mantra but youve got to continue to indict mccain
7429374 the bottom line is do you want four more years when they leave the convention they need to have fairly vetted that and answered that question
7429375 oh that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always so that it might go well with them and their children forever
7429376 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
7429377 yea thou i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with with me
7429378 its a great result for all the players to find out whether were going or not going
7429379 its a good decision for cricket and we are pleased it was unanimous
7429380 we look forward to dealing with our international colleagues over the details of when the tournament will be postponed to
7429381 by postponing the tournament until october next year there is time for the security situation in pakistan to improve or for a suitable alternative venue to be chosen
7429382 we appreciate the difficulties that this decision will cause the pakistan cricket board and hope that the champions trophy can be held there in 2009
7429383 hopefully ill be playing for a few years to come so hopefully ill get the opportunity to play in pakistan
7429384 come next year whenever they put it back on were looking forward to regaining that trophy but right now all the guys are rapt that the icc has made a decision
7429385 no fui con l a bolivia porque me traumatiz lo que viv en el congo
7429386 mis hijos no tienen el compromiso que tuvimos nosotros con la revoluci n
7429387 vivo sin privilegios y considero que ya es hora de que haya reformas en cuba

7429392 ya me qued a trabajar en el hospital no me iba mal
7429393 a partir de ah se dedica a robar y se convierte en un sanguinario con lo que durante seis a os se fue creando el caldo de cultivo para la revoluci n
7429394 y eso hace tambi n que el movimiento revolucionario crezca con sentido y con sentimiento
7429395 era un hombre que hac a cosas por eso se distingu a l mont el primer campamento estable de la guerrilla organiz el avituallamiento construy un hospital todo lo imprescindible para vivir en aquellos lugares donde no hab a nada supongo que por eso cuando triunfa la revoluci n le nombraron ministro de industria ten a esa capacidad no com n de hacer cosas

7429400 era un hombre muy recto que predicaba con el ejemplo un lector incansable quiz s el m s culto de los dirigentes revolucionarios y que cuando dec a amigo era amigo de verdad yo as lo sent

7429408 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him
7429409 ive observed mr long in situations that would be trying to just about anyone
7429410 he seemed to me to be extremely poised and lucid
7429411 i feel the war on terror is a war on peace
7429412 the morality of what he did should lessen the punishment

7429445 exceptional games which took it beyond being the best ever
7429446 the icc board today agreed unanimously to postpone the champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan from sept 12 until october 2009
7429447 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board pcb and the situation it finds itself in
7429448 however there was also a realisation that under the circumstances some of the teams had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7429449 under the circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 and we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7429450 i remember the police coming at us you didnt know to turn around and run you just kept going forward and i think we kept going forward until someone said they had guns
7429451 when they said chicago police had guns some of us turned and started to run and some of us went at them and charged them they charged us and there was fights and people were getting knocked in the head with billy clubs
7429452 i looked down on the street and i saw the chicago police in military form they were in military formation and they approached the crowd that i just left they picked up speed and then they started swinging their billy clubs as they ran into that crowd no warning no tear gas no nothing
7429453 i was too stupid to be scared the feeling was that we needed to change america and that was our focus
7429454 we were on the ground trying to link our hands together trying to do peaceful demonstration against the chicago mob cops and it just didnt work so we just started fighting they fought us we fought them they were throwing us in paddy wagons they were dragging us knocking us down and it didnt make a difference if you were a man or a woman it was just crazy
7429455 we couldnt believe that this was happening in our country the demonstrators did not cause the riot it was a police riot then the next day following that the national guard was called in and they lined the streets of chicago and it was like you were in occupied territory it was devastating
7429456 i remember coming out of the hilton hotel into the streets and it was just complete chaos the next thing i know i was pushed with a whole bunch of other mostly 20 year olds up against the windows because the police were coming up with batons some on horse some on foot pushing us back trying to put us in a containable area
7429457 there is a fine line between courage and stupidity and i was on the stupidity side but i stayed out there because there was a lot of people that i worked with on the campaign who had been hit and i think we were all pretty outraged by the chicago police so i stayed in the streets
7429458 theyre being inconsistent just because its 40 years later the war in iraq is every bit as egregious as the vietnam war
7429459 and now the free speech that they exercised in chicago in 1968 they dont feel that they need to extend that to the demonstrators here in denver in 2008
7429460 i wouldnt even call it irony id call it hypocrisy were being confined to freedom cages and were being shut down
7429461 the rights are the same in 1960 i was 40 years younger but i was not willing to listen now after 40 years im willing to listen a little more i think its a legitimate question as to whether or not trying to channel the protests
7429462 i think its gone too far the other way i think we should give them some leeway here i dont think they should be that far from the convention and i dont think that they should be in a cage because they have every right to do what we did and as long as everybody keeps a cool head everything will stay under control
7429463 theres a balance that has to be struck its critical that we have enough security because of my history of being with the senator and not that far from him when the shots rang out i am worried about security i do have concern
7429464 we are confident this performance provides a clear path for delivering improved results in full year 2009 and beyond

7429469 he is so special that you wonder if he is flesh and blood if horses were made out of concrete and stone he would be made out of something harder
7429470 he is just one of those very special horses and you can see that yourself
7429471 he will never win too far which is probably to his advantage
7429472 if all is well with him the plan will be to go leopardstown with him in two weeks for the irish champion stakes
7429473 hes beaten but definitely not battered he ran a good race and is obviously on the way back
7429474 well regroup and im sure youll see a different horse in two weeks time im not using the ground as an excuse
7429475 it will be leopardstown next for the irish champion stakes
7429476 well have to look at the cheveley park stakes now shes not in it at the moment but well have to discuss that
7429477 the second is a nice filly she just struggled for a bit of speed
7429478 it was my fault he wasnt left in the st leger

7429480 im hoping for good ground at ascot and that all three leading three year olds henrythenavigator ravens pass and tamayuz turn up im not afraid to take henry on again but soft ground would mean wed be an unlikely runner
7429481 the plan has always been the breeders cup mile as hes us bred and part owned by an american operation
7429482 hes bred for quick ground but i wouldnt be too keen on running him on the quick ground as a three year old

7429485 whats happened this year is we seem to have reached a tipping point at which the oil price shock is acting on economic growth and we are seeing a global slowdown and that makes it harder for airlines to pass on the costs
7429486 if the airlines start dropping off routes everyone is going to suffer the airports the hotels you name it
7429487 unlike the 9 11 incident or sars which had short term damage to aviation rising fuel prices will be a long term problem
7429488 no frills carriers tend to go for the leisure travel and that is more volatile when the economy turns down
7429489 i think we are going to see some more casualties in terms of carriers not surviving the downturn
7429490 the paradox is that at a time when the industry is going through a crisis the reality is that boeing and airbus are selling everything they can make
7429491 the people who suffer when oil prices spike like this are the ones with old aircraft
7429492 the beneficiaries are airlines that have got young fleets with highly fuel efficient modern aircraft
7429493 there is a very positive outlook for airlines with fuel efficient modern fleets
7429494 indonesia is a vast archipelago nation and air transportation is the most feasible facility
7429495 what we are finding is that there are quite a lot of countries including significantly sized and powerful countries who share very much the same kinds of concerns that new zealand has raised
7429496 we dont think that anything we are asking for is unreasonable
7429497 we are not trying to obstruct indias ability to receive supplies of material and technology for a civilian nuclear capacity
7429498 domestic carriers in vietnam are subject to fare caps set by the government
7429499 the positive news for an airline is that the fuel surcharges came into effect last week
7429500 a lot of hotels which were riding on a very good season last year just boosted up their prices in the hope of having another good season
7429501 some hotels went up 40 to 50 per cent and the outlook for the end of the year will be pretty flat or even down in occupancy for some hotels
7429502 the compounded effect of higher hotel prices plus airfares plus inflation in vietnam which added costs to food and transport right now i would say vietnam is in not such a rosy situation

7429520 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter

7429527 omnimark has been the secret weapon of markup language programmers since the earliest days of sgml its new xml support should bring it to a far wider audience

7429543 he has been working with me for about six years and this arrest has hit me like a sledgehammer
7429544 he is obviously innocent until proven guilty and we will be taking an interest in the case
7429545 i wont be able to comment further until the case has been concluded
7429546 its hard to believe that a councillor has been charged with such a serious offence and we will have to wait and see what happens
7429547 im just glad that im able to being something home to everyone who has supported me and cheered me on throughout these olympics
7429548 its fantastic to be bringing home a medal but i always believed in my own ability i was disappointed with the judges scoring in the semi final i think the crowd played a big part
7429549 your initial aim is to qualify for the olympics but then once you are here you want to win a medal and thankfully i was able to do that
7429550 i hope therell be a few more when i get home
7429551 wayne and hugh both went on to have very good professional careers after the olympics but im still not sure what path ill be taking i might hang around for london 2012
7429552 were all just so proud of him hes come to the olympics and really done the business
7429553 qualifying for beijing was a big achievement so to have gone on and won a medal is something very special the whole experience has been phenomenal weve had so many messages of support from back home and were very grateful to everyone for getting behind paddy
7429554 hopefully now the sporting bodies can put a decent package in place to enable paddy to stay amateur and go for gold at london 2012 hes already had approaches to turn professional but i would love him to put his pro career at least on hold but the lad has to live and im just hoping that common sense prevails in terms of funding
7429555 i specialise in a business pool which includes belfast and scotland and im proud to describe myself as a loyalist and a unionist
7429556 a wide range of organisations come to us because we provide management training and marketing skills
7429557 when the bnp contacted us i had no option but to work with them it was an exciting business proposal
7429558 i understand the truth truck could soon be on its way to northern ireland but thats nothing to do with me
7429559 the bnp are not an illegal organisation so why shouldnt i work with them i dont think their members are involved in criminal activity
7429560 i have worked in northern ireland for a long time but not for any proscribed organisations the bnp is not a proscribed organisation
7429561 it would be wrong for me to pontificate about the views of the bnp and i honestly cant think of anyone i wouldnt work with
7429562 dowsons marketing plan is nothing more than a begging letter
7429563 the bnp is in very serious financial trouble and this is how they think they can get money
7429564 the bnp may not be illegal but they articulate views which clearly motivate people to commit very serious attacks on minorities
7429565 there is an element of inciting hatred there is no attraction in northern ireland for this type of politics and i would discourage this party from coming over here we have always had good race relations in northern ireland there may be the odd incident but that does not represent the majority of people here
7429566 we want to be able to choose between the different school establishments run by the state as well as those run privately this is on condition that those schools are open to everyone without discrimination
7429567 we are in favour of the best possible cooperation between public and private
7429568 but free choice entails too great a cost as several studies have shown
7429569 to educate a citizen we have to make the most of the childhood years to mix children without distinction of social or ethnic background free choice inevitably leads to ghettos
7429570 today only a well off family can take their child out of school why should one have to keep ones children in a school that is not functioning
7429571 and why is it that only children from less advantaged backgrounds have to stay there is it up to them to maintain a social link when the others have left
7429572 in countries where it exists between 80 and 95 per cent of parents choose the schools nearest to where they live if the state school is good the pupils stay there

7429707 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority associate professor juliet richters and her colleagues wrote in the
7429708 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious said prof richters author of the book
7429709 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation she said

7429722 dick meyer has done the impossible he diagnoses the self loathing moral confusion and ennui that infect supersized america without hectoring us and badgering us and without tiresome self righteousness or smugness why we hate us takes us on a rollicking laugh out loud ride across the brittle american landscape and by us i mean all of us liberal and conservative black and white city dwellers suburbanites and farmers dick meyer understands that our national culture is on life support and he has thought long and hard about how to resuscitate it read this book if not for you than for your children and for the america they will inherit
7429723 a widely respected player in national politics dick meyer has transcended the game most americans hate to describe a larger context of relentless marketing omnipresent pseudo events and above all the enshrinement of phoniness that pollute the public square mixing original research a keen analytic mind and mordant wicked wit why we hate us should be the bible for the vast majority of americans who tell pollsters the country is on the wrong track but arent clear why
7429724 this is a serious thought provoking discourse on america in the age of instant communication and a reminder that our new ability to know everything about everybody all the time may not be all good
7429725 meyer has written a deeply informed critique of those toxic and menacing aspects of american culture in which individuals families and communities have suffered as self awareness self realization and self actualization became the measure of emotional and existential health meyer has put into words the tensions and anxieties that grip all americans as they go about the difficult task of achieving happiness while struggling to find a compass to give their lives moral legitimacy and purpose if you are aiming for one guide to the well lived life buy this book

7429731 we shopped a lot when we first came here but the loft building has all the fundamentals for a great investment and the fundamentals for a great community

7429746 2009 is liable to be very difficult we must exercise restraint stability and caution the economy is liable to deteriorate the cost of the instant gratification of increased expenditures is liable to be long term loss the economy must not be subjected to electioneering games

7429832 poco tempo fa a margine di un convegno organizzato a savona dal porto ho incontrato il sottosegretario alle infrastrutture e ai trasporti bartolomeo giachino il presidente della commissione trasporti e infrastrutture del senato luigi grillo e lassessore regionale borioli e stata una chiacchierata molto importante perch per i progetti che stiamo portando avanti con linteressamento delle ferrovie italiane servir laiuto concreto di stato e regione a settembre poi gi stato deciso un incontro fra i rappresentanti di governo e regione il presidente dellautorit portuale di savona rino canavese e i sindaci di carmagnola mondov cuneo e fossano per fare il punto della situazione il progetto di uno scalo merci ferroviario e di un polo logistico per linterscambio gomma rotaia a fossano che permetta alle aziende della provincia di cuneo di abbattere i costi del trasporto merci e di contribuire alla salvaguardia dellambiente interessa a tutte queste citt
7429833 il progetto semplice un nuovo scalo merci a fossano non pi nella zona centrale della citt che possa diventare un importante nodo di interscambio con le merci che viaggiano con i camion sulla torino savona il nuovo porto di interscambio dovr essere rilocalizzato in unarea accessibile dallautostrada e vicina alla ferrovia per evitare che i camion viaggino sulle provinciali attenzione per non stiamo parlando di di capannoni e cemento ma solo di uno scalo merci razionale si tratta di unopera che far risparmiare le aziende che oggi trovano pi conveniente spedire lmigliaia di metri quadratie merci a rotterdam su strada piuttosto che via mare o su rotaia
7429834 noi siamo dellidea che non esista una contrapposizione tra la logistica cuneese quella alessandrina o regionale alessandria e si trovano infatti sul corridoio 24 che collega genova con rottedam noi invece insistiamo sul passante ferroviario tra la zona portuale di savona torino e novara le imprese cuneese esportano circa 5 milioni di tonnellate di merci allanno ed chiaro che non possono che giovare di una migliore e pi evoluta organizzazione dei trasporti che oggi sono destinati tutti su gomma
7429835 ferrovie italiane molto interessata al discorso perch nella logica di razionalizzazione degli scali merci italiani i vertici dellazienda pensano che fossano abbia le carte in regola per diventare un grande scalo nel giro di tre o quattro anni inoltre il livello di efficienza del traffico ferroviario dovr crescere notevolmente anche sulle tratte brevi questo limpegno un altro partner indispensabile il porto di savona che tra le altre cose possiede mezzi propri come locomotori e vagoni secondo gli ultimi calcoli anche solo le tre imprese pi grandi del cuneese da sole potrebbero garantire come volumi teorici un treno al giorno
7429836 abbiamo calcolato una superficie massima di 200 mila metri quadrati con attrezzature contenute che nel tempo una volta messo in opera lo scalo potranno essere ingrandite

7429838 voglio dire il cielo bianco certo e a quanto ho capito non una cosa naturale nel nostro mondo ma mi sembra tutto un po troppo simile al mondo che dovremmo aver lasciato se capite cosa intendo
7429839 gi avevo sempre pensato che fosse parecchio diverso il luogo dove risiedono le divinit
7429840 non sar che invece di farci salire quel tuo incantesimo ci ha riportati a terra
7429841 venite dalla cima della collina dovrei riuscire a scorgere i punti di riferimento di questo mondo
7429842 non ne conosco il motivo ma questo mondo modellato ad imitazione di paesaggi del nostro mondo mi pare che quando ci venni la prima volta mi fu spiegato che questo mondo diviso in regni uno per ogni divinit e ogni regno modellato in base al volere del dio
7429843 davvero chiss perch hanno scelto paesaggi del genere me li sarei aspettati pi astratti metafisici
7429844 non temere da quel che ricordo cera un regno cos l era sempre notte il terreno era paludoso e popolato da creature orrende e deformi il lezzo che proveniva da quella terra mi raggiungeva anche se stavo volando
7429845 quello dovrebbe essere il regno di brotin oggi deve essere di umore cupo e laggi invece quelle nubi gialle ecco l si dovrebbe trovare la residenza di lhytre
7429846 gaerlen sarete contenta di sapere che il regno delloscuro ancora come era ai miei tempi io invece lo sono meno perch se tornato cos vuol dire che il potere del dio sta tornando e questa volta non ho le mie armi
7429847 andiamo il cammino lungo e il tempo non penso sia molto
7429848 e allora dovremmo camminare per tutta la vita fino a giungere laggi
7429849 scusate ma avverto molte forme vitali avvicinarsi velocemente e mi sembra di avvertire intenzioni ostili da parte loro
7429850 may we please end the era when we whisper our nationality in foreign countries where we know so much of our soul has been sold to the highest bidder and where we have grown so soft and unambitious as to our role in the world

7429857 however with auto makers getting near the end of one model year and getting ready to start the next sales are beginning to show some signs of improving over julys dismal sales performance

7429879 yep works like a charm even if you say it jokingly either that or just act really intelligent and informed i know thats a stretch for you but no defense attorney risks having bright people on his jury

7429883 thats just because im high on paint and varnish fumes
7429884 whatever it takes to get your head in the right place
7429885 ahh yeah i heard they gave up checking tickets after the first three hours on friday so im sure half the citys crashed the party by now
7429886 yeah makes for a quiet afternoon down here in the mish just us and the mexicans and this assbag on stage
7429887 thats beautiful youre a fucking poet man cheers to that
7429888 they hit some fancy place in piedmont some ritzy spot full of cal alumni and prius drivers
7429889 thats true you can get away with robbing people downtown for months on end but you start scaring the berkeley gentry and theyll hunt you down and kill you in the street like a dog oakland police know who signs their paychecks you dont fuck with that tax bracket
7429890 so what have you learned so far in this whole academy business
7429891 ive learned i never want to pick up another goddamn paintbrush
7429892 now i know that doesnt really sound like advice in the traditional sense but it is
7429893 when you go back home back east to whatever liberal arts college town you come from you can sing that song and its fine and i hope it gets you laid but seriously here come on man go outside tell me what you smell
7429894 if you go out this door and into the alley you do not smell fresh empanadas cooking or chilis and garlic roasting or any of that you know what you smell

7429903 sebanyak 50 persen lainnya hanya berupa sisa sisa bangunan benteng
7429904 jumlah 257 benteng peninggalan bangsa asing di nusantara ini bisa jadi bertambah banyak jumlah itu di luar benteng yang dibangun raja raja di nusantara saat kami melakukan pendataan di indonesia timur data awal kami ada 100 benteng tetapi saat pendataan di lapangan kami menemukan ada 107 benteng jumlah itu saja masih mungkin bertambah karena kami sempat kesulitan mencapai beberapa lokasi yang disurvei
7429905 indonesia perlu belajar dari negara lain seperti india yang mampu merestorasi benteng benteng masa kolonial menjadi hotel hingga obyek wisata yang menarik dan bernilai ekonomis
7429906 inilah yang menjadi amanah dari persyarikatan kita amanah yang direalisasikan dalam berbagai bentuk amal usaha seperti lembaga pendidikan lembaga keuangan mikro panti asuhan anak yatim rumah sakit dan sebagainya
7429907 kita berbuat untuk akselerasi dalam kepentingan nasional untuk kepentingan indonesia sendiri
7429908 disinilah pekerjaan rumah kita pekerjaan yang harus kita lakukan bersama dalam persyarikatan ini
7429909 meski demikian saat ini belum ada data yang pasti tentang jumlah kota pusaka di indonesia
7429910 ada satu masa yang tidak nyambung saat pengelola kota membangun kotanya tetapi tidak pernah mengidentifikasi cagar budaya yang ada di kota tersebut kepala daerah membangun kotanya tanpa melihat masa lalu kota tersebut
7429911 itu pula sebabnya kehancuran kota kota pusaka dengan mudah terjadi di negeri ini
7429912 kegiatan pelestarian bukan sekadar membuat peraturan daerah tentang perlindungan benda cagar budaya tetapi lebih dari itu bagaimana memanfaatkan benda cagar budaya bagaimana mengembangkannya agar bisa mendatangkan manfaat ekonomi
7429913 di dalam peraturan tersebut jelas dilarang mengubah bentuk bangunan yang ada di sepanjang jalan kesawan namun dinas tata kota medan tetap menerbitkan izin membangun bangunan untuk ruko rumah toko yang jelas jelas mengubah bentuk asli bangunan di jalan kesawan ini kan pembiaran dari pemerintah daerah upaya menghancurkan pusaka kota secara sistematis

7429916 for a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin real life but they was always some abstacle in the way something to be gotten through first some unfinished business time to be served a debt to be paid then life would begin at last it dawned on me that these obstacles were in my life
7429917 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
7429918 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
7429919 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
7429920 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
7429921 you can look at that body of work that he had when he played and hes in the hall of fame
7429922 you look at the body of work since hes played and its hall of fame material too
7429923 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
7429924 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
7429925 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
7429926 both on the field of play and off this will go down as one of the greatest performances ever for a united states olympic team
7429927 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7429928 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7429929 its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
7429930 china was eager to present something that shows it is a new power that has its own might
7429931 it has problems but it is able to manage them it has weaknesses in its institutions but also strengths in those same institutions
7429932 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world
7429933 i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
7429934 they have earned a tremendous amount of face because of the olympics
7429935 they are going to ride on that for a while we dont have a culture that is pro change china by nature has got to be provoked to make changes the economic reforms came about because we were desperately poor
7429936 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments insecurity and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its authoritarian control
7429937 i would hope that we would look back at this as a major threshold of when china ditched all its baggage of the historical narrative of aggrieved nationalism
7429938 and just rewrote that narrative and began to act with more confidence about itself and its role in the world
7429939 i think that would make china and chinese become more tolerant and open
