1860175 well what do you think ever happened to our parents ignitus never mentioned who our parents were and when i was evil i never really found to many dragons other then the ones who were fighting
1860176 i dont know the only parents i know of are my foster ones they are the ones who have taken care of me since birth but i dont know what happened to them
1860177 oh nothing we were just wanting to know about something
1860178 well i guess you should know but lets go somewhere first
1860179 young dragons during the dark masters reign he tried to destroy the dragons when the year of the dragon came closer we wanted all of the eggs that were lain to be taken to the temple so we could safe guard them until they were old enough to help fight however that wasnt the case i remember standing here several years ago waiting for young dragons and dragonesses to being their young so we could place them in the grotto one in particular caught my eye she carried both yours and spyros egg here she gave them to me without saying a word and flew off i never saw her face for it was covered with a hood the entire time though i did note that she was a white dragoness
1860180 i dont think so some dragonesses would bring others eggs because they were unable to themselves besides you two dont seem like brother and sister we can usually tell and you two dont look like it
1860181 so do you think that dragon had to do with our parents
1860182 i dont know spyro i dont know all i do know is that you two shouldnt burden yourselves with these thoughts you are here and now we are at peace thanks to you two
1860183 well i would have never been able to do it without your guidance
1860184 spyro if its one thing that you you both have shown me is that hope is something we have to cling onto even in the darkest of times without it we cant do our job
1860185 spyro cynder you dont know how proud we are of you you have both restored peace and balance to the dragon realms
1860186 thank you little ones you two should be outside today is a great day that shouldnt be wasted indoors go out and have some fun you two have earned it
1860187 i dont need to cheat i won fair and square
1860188 i dont think so maybe want to go check it out
1860189 i dont know cynder but it seemed as though the purple dragon and a black dragon were really important
1860190 i dont know cynder but whoever those two dragons are they are supposed to do something
1860191 well im going to go train a bit with ignitus talk to you later spyro
1860192 that is all for today get some rest young one you will need it
1860193 but ignitus you know that there is no dark master why must we train
1860194 ah young one it is always good to be prepared even for anything
1860195 alright ill walk up and say hi maybe ask how was your day wait why am i doing this hes just another dragon after all
1860196 uh hey cynder did ignitus let you out early today
1860197 there is no need the other guardians are gone for a few more hours and i am feeling a bit tired today is such a beautiful day why dont you go and spend it outside
1860198 i wonder how he manages to stay so strong when he rarely practices
1860199 i have to keep practicing to keep strong yet he is a natural fighter
1860200 oh you think no i dont like him if thats what youre thinking
1860201 no i mean it i dont like him do i
1860202 ya missed purple boy need to work on that aim of yours
1860203 so now that were done with training you got any idea what to do now

1860206 i dont know thats what im trying to find out
1860207 well do you have any other ideas for games that dont involve trees

1860214 listen you two i have seen a strange vision that troubles me i have been unable to figure it out
1860215 it has a creature in it a strange one the creature seems to be calling for help and he looks badly injured
1860216 can you tell where he is maybe we can help him
1860217 im afraid i cant tell where he is in the background are several rocky objects and i cant tell you any more
1860218 listen spyro i know you want to help but first we need to get more information on this however i was wondering if you two had any knowledge to what this might mean
1860219 its just that i had a dream similar to what ignitus was telling us
1860220 ive seen many soldiers fall and die they have served with honor and with the greatest sacrifice that could ever be given its not fair to call them heroes though they did leave a new legacy upon the world freedom

1860240 todays verdict does little if anything to advance american security the entire process raises fundamental questions about the administrations disregard for our constitutional values and may well do america more harm than good in the court of world opinion
1860241 it took seven years for the bush administrations military commissions system to get its first conviction for a crime that is regularly prosecuted in federal court and when it did it was a driver who even the administration acknowledges did not participate in the planning or execution of any terrorist attacks surely there is a better way to protect america and bring terrorists to justice while adhering to the constitutional values that have kept us safe and strong for 200 years

1860251 a friend of india and a supporter of us india nuclear cooperation
1860252 i find it incomprehensible that the administration apparently intends to seek or accept an exemption from the nuclear suppliers group guidelines for india with few or none of the conditions contained in the henry j hyde united states india peaceful atomic energy cooperation act of 2006
1860253 such an exemption would be inconsistent with us law and will place american firms at a severe competitive disadvantage and undermine critical us nonproliferation objectives
1860254 it would also jeopardise congressional support for nuclear cooperation with india this year and in the future
1860255 a resolution that expresses the sense of the house that the president should withhold support from any proposed exemption for india in the nsg guidelines that is not fully consistent with the hyde act and that does not incorporate a number of key provisions including the immediate termination of all nuclear commerce by nsg member states if india detonates a nuclear explosive device or if the iaea determines that india has violated its safeguards commitments explained the indo us nuclear deal a requirement that the safeguards agreement concluded between india and the iaea provides for safeguards in perpetuity for all nuclear facilities materials equipment and technology designated as civil in accordance with iaea standards principles and practices a prohibition on the transfer of enrichment reprocessing and heavy water production technology by any nsg member state to india a stipulation that nsg supplier states may not grant india consent to reprocess nuclear fuel except in a facility that is under permanent and unconditional safeguards
1860256 before the foreign affairs committee on february 13 of this year you assured me that any nsg decision will have to be completely consistent with the obligations of the hyde act
1860257 i expect you to instruct the us representative to the nsg not to seek or support any exemption for india that does not faithfully reflect all of the hyde act conditions
1860258 however even if the members of the nsg were able to achieve consensus on the many complex issues related to the india exemption during those sessions and the administration were able to submit the india agreement to congress immediately after we convene on september 8 it is not likely that congress will have sufficient time to fully consider all the issues and details surrounding the agreement the associated safeguards agreement and the nsg decision and to ascertain their impact on us and global nonproliferation standards prior to the target adjournment date of september 26
1860259 any effort to consider the agreement outside of the requirements of current law will be impossible if the administration accepts the nsg exemption that fails to include the hyde act conditions
1860260 deeply concerned about the potential for a significant time gap between an accelerated nsg decision and congressional action on the india agreement
1860261 this would give other countries an unacceptable head start in securing commercial nuclear contracts with the indian government thus placing us firms at a competitive disadvantage
1860262 if the administration is unwilling to change its position and make clear to the other members of the nsg that it will only accept an exemption that fully conforms to the hyde act then i would urge you in the strongest possible terms to suspend all us efforts to seek an nsg decision on india for the remainder of this administration
1860263 given the lateness in the congressional session it would be better to review these complex matters in the next congress when they can receive a full and serious examination

1860311 the 9500 gt gddr3 is essentially a reworking and optimization of the popular 8600 gts gpu on a smaller process the extra 30 is well worth stepping up to a radeon 3850 but if you want the absolute cheapest gaming card and dont plan to go higher than the 1280x1024 resolution the 9500 gt is a good option just be sure to get the faster gddr3 version not the slower ddr2 equipped cards
1860312 we have a hard time recommending anything more expensive than two radeon 4850s as more data surfaces as to how the 4870 gtx 260 and gtx 280 perform in multiple card configurations compared to two 4850s in crossfire we might add a higher price point to the list but for now the power of two 4850s in crossfire is our top recommendation for performance while two radeon 4850s are really the way to go in terms of price performance those of you who have an sli motherboard will probably find staying with nvidias video cards a cost effective choice for you folks two geforce 9800 gtx cards are about as good as it gets
1860313 samsung has clearly tried to optimize its new ssd drive for better streaming performance both read and write the results show up in the benchmarks this is one of the most balanced performers weve seen in the still far from mature ssd market
1860314 anandtech ati radeon hd 4870 x2 r700 preview amds fastest single card
1860315 our early look at the performance of the radeon hd 4870 x2 code named r700 is at once exciting and disappointing
1860316 users who would like to build an sli graphics subsystem have very limited options when it comes to choosing mainboards for lga 775 processors nvidia nforce 6 series doesnt support contemporary intel processors nvidia nforce 780i sli and nforce 750i sli run very warm and unstable during overclocking we can only leave the decision making to sli fans here you may either use only one graphics card or give up cpu overclocking altogether or overclock to pretty mediocre speeds you may wait for new nvidia chipsets or even switch to ati graphics cards the choice is yours and at this time we cannot recommend any nvidia nforce 750i sli based mainboards none of them are really good so no wonder very few companies have them in their product range
1860317 both chipsets have reached a level of integration performance and efficiency that is far above what most of us associate with the term
1860318 toms hardware amd and nvidia platforms do battle hybrid graphics platforms to fire up multi gpu rendering
1860319 there are several leaders that can be singled out first of all it is the samsung syncmaster 961gw splendid on the outside and with a fast matrix inside second rtc enabled model in this review the syncmaster 931cw differs from the others with its extended color gamut among the slower models benqs e900wa and g900wa feature good color reproduction which is quite a rare thing for tn matrixes the asus vw193s is somewhat inferior to benqs models in terms of color reproduction yet good enough anyway it also has a surprisingly uniform brightness of the backlight
1860320 as the dust settles the clear winner of this contest depends
1860321 the p45 is a transitional product that makes limited sense it is not worth purchasing a p45 platform system unless you insist on pci express 2 0 and want to avoid forking out the money for an x48 motherboard or a platform based on nvidias nforce 790i ultra sli the p45 doesnt deliver better performance while it increases average power consumption it offers some new features but it cuts back on usb 2 0 and sata throughput if you want to buy a new intel system today p35 will most likely be the best option
1860322 amd has an excellent argument for going with a cpu with an odd number of cores the triple core equipped cpu performed admirably most of the time
1860323 the battle was finally over i threw up my white flag once again a victim of
1860324 i only share with people who share with people who share
1860325 its easy to make a conclusion to this roundup it goes like this antec power supplies are good to be specific the 7 models including the nonstandard ar 350 all have good electrical parameters low level of noise and an adequate selection of cables and connectors i havent found a serious flaw in any of them the basiq 500 may look rather unassuming compared with the other models but it belongs to the most inexpensive series after all
1860326 it turned out pretty hard to draw any definite conclusions today on the one hand lets try to answer the following question what will potential aquagate max users get a liquid cooling system as efficient as a good air cooler compatible with limited number of system cases equipped with uncontrollable fans generating tangible noise and featuring a price tag of 229 doesnt seem to be very promising does it
1860327 the new very high end gtx 280 from nvidia 650 suffers a little from comparison with the 9800 gx2 which regularly bested its performance in tests despite the inherent and irremediable drawbacks of bi gpu cards
1860328 for all this nvidia is asking quite the premium for its new high end flagship with the gtx 280 priced at a whopping us 649 at launch far beyond any existing high end gpus now
1860329 most impressive is the way it matches the more expensive more power hungry under load and larger geforce gtx 260 card in the right games and with the right settings
1860330 with the same qualities as the radeon hd 4850 but at a higher price point the radeon hd 4870 manages to compete directly with the geforce gtx 260 its both a little faster and a good deal less expensive than the nvidia card and without the excessive noise despite its higher power consumption with prices as they stand currently theres really no doubt that its the better choice
1860331 nvidia has led the industry with performance and price competitiveness for a couple of generations now while ati relied on supporting new standards and features that have generally being underused by developers tessellation and directx 10
1860332 theres no denying that the 4850 is a very good card its performance is only 19 below the geforce 260 gtx and is overall on a par with the geforce 9800 gtx while beating out the 3870 x2 despite its advance in presenting the geforce 9800 gtx nvidia has been bested for performance price ratio and at this price level
1860333 i suppose if money is extremely tight and youre looking just for wireless home networking with a minimal feature set the wrt110 is one way to go
1860334 for those that demand ultimate quality and class the pc v2110 qualifies as the stylish statesman of pc cases
1860335 so these are the highs and lows of the tested drives but the most important point about them is the price factor the price of a 1 terabyte drive has lowered by a half since the moment they hit the market all thanks to the competition with four manufacturers elbowing each other aside in this market sector we are up to more price cuts
1860336 the linksys ultra rangeplus wireless n router wrt160n is a good choice if youre looking for the cheapest wireless n router you can find
1860337 much like the eee pc the eee box is going to be very much a love it or hate it machine
1860338 both platforms provide a better feature set and more flexibility than any other chipset for the intel architecture available today there are small advantages for the x48 chipset regarding performance and overclocking but they dont really count towards my conclusion as no one will ever notice them the intel chipset will be maxed out with two ati radeon hd graphics cards the nvidia platform will work with up to three geforce 8800 gtx or faster cards or with the geforce 9800 gx2 double deckers effectively providing quad graphics for the enthusiast
1860339 we like the twelve hundred a lot but its hard to look at its premium price 200 with no power supply and not wish for more its well thought out roomy enough for a lot of high end components and attractive in a minimalist way but its also pretty
1860340 generally speaking the ati radeon hd 3650 is a variation of the ati radeon hd 2600 xt with certain architectural improvements but it is unclear why the developer decided to lower the clock rates the radeon hd 2600 xt was not fast even with gddr4 memory and the ati radeon hd 3650 turns out to be even slower yes it costs a mere 99 for the gddr3 version but we dont see a proper application for it this card cannot interest gamers and seems to be targeted at the multimedia market where its popularity will depend on the accessories included with it by the particular graphics card vendor
1860341 the change to a new generation of graphics card achieves more but the cpu should still have sufficient brawn to provide the basic level the card requires changing from a geforce 6800 gt to a current geforce 8800 or 9800 can quintuple the overall results for 3d games changing from a geforce 7950 gt to one of the new g92 graphic chips will at least double the overall results
1860342 selecting the right components is important in building an energy efficient machine if you go for an old pentium d instead of the current core 2 duo processor you will get two processing cores in both cases and even higher clock speeds with the pentium d the old pentium generation is based on the netburst architecture though which is considerably slower than the core 2 family including the pentium dual core which is a stripped down version despite its deficient performance the pentium d will still consume much more power than a core 2 processor under all possible conditions clearly selecting the right technology is very important

1860458 but wont the mmm mmm fff wont the bridge burn down
1860459 nonsense its constructed of stone the bridge burns only as long as dragons breath remains on the bridge when the breaths gone the fire dies the stone blocks beneath the fire will hardly be scorched the bridge survives nicely
1860460 thats why i say we dismount now and walk the horses give them time to recuperate in this infernal heat and give us time to remove our helmets and cool our brains i dont know how soon or even if well encounter that dragon but we have one thing going for us

1860471 too much emphasis is placed on brushing the smile surfaces the upper teeth that are fairly accessible
1860472 but the areas where the teeth come into contact with the tongue and cheek are neglected thats where you need to concentrate your efforts
1860473 most people brush the smile area and give the rest of the teeth a quick iou
1860474 its like a brushless car wash if you use enough water pressure to blast the plaque off it might hurt the gums
1860475 something must happen in the aging process but we havent put our finger on it yet
1860476 its a novelty item so maybe he would use it more
1860477 abraham believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness
1860478 foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head
1860479 let the dead bury their own dead but you go and proclaim the kingdom of god
1860480 i will follow you lord but first let me go back and say good by to my family
1860481 no one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of god
1860482 anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me 38 and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me 39 whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it

1860485 a lot of people still dont understand this disease or what is necessary to treat it
1860486 you can get health information anywhere it is a commodity
1860487 what we deliver through our social network platform are tools and a support group that can change the care people receive
1860488 a lot of people easily jump back and forth from myspace to
1860489 we are finding that people are becoming more interested in vertical sites as well
1860490 people have gotten used to communing online and now they want to do it around specific topics
1860491 niche social networks is an idea that is growing in popularity as people want to connect to others with similar interests to themselves
1860492 in addition to connecting to others it also gives them a one stop shop on articles and content surrounding what interests them this isnt only for fitness but can be applied across the board for fashion beauty and so on
1860493 niche social networks have more meat than sites like facebook which are really about stalking your friends
1860494 it brings together people with a common interest and connects them with the information they need
1860495 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
1860496 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

1860515 i had these cells injected in to me in my early thirties
1860516 i read that the famous heart surgeon christian barnard was involved in a swiss clinic researching fresh cell replacement
1860517 i went along to switzerland to have a course of 11 injections from the embryos of black sheep they would take from the liver glands bone and whatever and make up these injections it turned out that i was the youngest person to ever have the treatment whether that treatment lasted this long i dont know but i feel great
1860518 when i am on tour i have enough cardio work just on stage
1860519 but i did have a work out at a gym before our show in helsinki in finland back at home in new york i train about three or four times a week i also love dancing i am very fortunate and appreciate good health i try and look after myself and dont drink much apart from the odd glass of champagne
1860520 i had been performing all along with one or two solo albums but we could not get back with blondie because of legal problems we had publishing issues messy record company deals management problems i think that is one of the things that madonna was very smart about she understood the business and made good business decisions from the get go that is something she can be commended for
1860521 madonna has been complimentary about me over the years and that compensates she says that she listens to me for inspiration and i have to take that as a compliment but we are vastly different i have seen her play i think she is a very talented very organised person and takes no prisoners she puts on a great big show a very showbizzy show
1860522 we are having a great tour and i cant remember enjoying myself on stage more than this
1860523 i prefer to live for today and tomorrow not yesterday it is a life spirit thing not to think about regrets i am writing my autobiography at the moment and its very hard there is so much to remember and i never kept journals there are hours of story after story to tell when i am sitting around with the band members the stories and memories come out and i try to remember
1860524 i never thought that rock n roll was just for the young even when i was young myself i always respected the jazz artists and r amp b performers who were around at the time who were in their sixties or seventies at that point even the autographs i have asked for have been people like jack lemmon orson welles and lauren bacall i admire people who can survive and grow
1860525 i did the today show in america with lily allen and shes lovely
1860526 i love her album her wit and sense of herself she has such an interesting voice i do not think she needs my advice because she is already terrific there is so much talent out there look at the actress scarlett johansson we have talked and she is an exceptional girl she is so young but has a depth of understanding that goes beyond her years it is the same with kirsten dunst who was going to play me in a film face wise she could pull it off because we have the same sort of cheekboney kind of face she is very sweet with a warm personality these girls are showing that there is a conveyor belt of talent out there that will be the next generation
1860527 it crossed a boundary because it said forget the monarchy and that is a political statement why not say forget the republicans
1860528 we are on the watch for these types of things it could be said to be humorous but we felt it was more political than humorous and thats something that we have to protest
1860529 there are already people saying injection sites arent enough that true harm reduction is giving out heroin for free
1860530 you have to draw the line somewhere and we feel were drawing the line in a place canadians are comfortable
1860531 theres really little difference between needle exchanges and supervised injection sites except for in a supervised injection site theres a nurse there
1860532 i believe im on the side of compassion and on the side of the angels

1860543 the idea was to measure which levels of weight support and speeds give us the best combination of aerobic workout while reducing the impact on joints
1860544 we showed that a person can run faster in the g trainer at a lower weight and still get substantial aerobic benefits while maintaining good neuromuscular coordination
1860545 if you can decrease the intensity of these peak forces during running then you probably will decrease the risk of injury to the runner
1860546 he can run he tackles extremely well and hes smart
1860547 he has a sense of whats going on he carries himself as if hes been in the league four or five years he has a calm about him it never seems as if the stage is too big for him
1860548 once youre in the league big small school everybody gets treated the same
1860549 they bring you in to play something special teams youre expected to get good and get to knowing what youre doing
1860550 he kind of ran me over with a stiff arm
1860551 so i came back got mad hit him and put him on the ground thats just my attitude you bring it to me im gonna bring it to you
1860552 even though we werent tackling live he said oh thats how were playing and put his chest on johnson and knocked him down
1860553 i see him smooth things out every day he is a fluid athlete in the drills hes a good communicator in the back end which is key when they talk to each other and you can hear the talk thats important for the secondary coaches and the defensive coordinator to hear you cant be afraid back there to pull the trigger and make a decision get them lined up

1860555 apple has been criticized by some environmental organizations for not being a leader in removing toxic chemicals from its new products and for not aggressively or properly recycling its old products

1860557 fortunately all ipod displays already use leds for illumination and therefore contain no mercury

1860571 our research tells us consumers have about five or six reasons for wanting local freshness and taste keeping farmland in the community and having open spaces a desire to be close to the food source and know where it comes from support of local farmers and keeping money in the community embedded in all of this is concern about food safety all this creates pretty powerful interest
1860572 the reports lodged by two students from smk telok panglima garang last friday stated that a female history teacher had allegedly called indian students keling pariah negro and black monkeys amongst other derogatory names in the report the form four and form five student said the teacher purportedly told students during class that indians came from dogs indians are children of prostitutes and the community is stupid they also allege that teacher had said the community youth did not have testicles always menstruates and indulged in thuggery and theft this is completely outrageous incidents like this shouldnt be happening period much less in schools how much of the same actually happens in other schools where they just go unnoticed unreported or ignored this is not the kind of language for anyone to be using to the teachers credit she has had the guts to admit that she did say what was alleged at the very least she has some conscience left lets hope she changes her mindset but what im curious about is the action that has been taken banting a secondary school teacher accused of hurling racial slurs against her indian students recently is on leave prior to her transfer on monday deputy minister in the prime ministers department senator t murugiah who visited smk telok panglima garang yesterday said the teacher regretted the incident and had apologised to the students she did not expect things to become so serious and has agreed to be transferred to another school

1860577 john tauler says in one of his sermons that when god is seeking our soul he acts like the woman in the gospel parable who lost her groat and turned the whole house upside down until she had found it this upsetting of our inner life is essential to spiritual growth because with out it we remain comfortably at rest in more or less illusory ideas of what spiritual perfection really is in the doctrine of st john of the cross this is described as the dark night of passive purification that empties us of our too human concepts of god and of divine things and leads us into the desert where we are nourished not by bread alone but by the means which can come only directly from him
1860578 my mother in law is 86 shes most of the time wheelchair bound
1860579 shes frail bent over and anyone with half a brain could look at her close up and see that shes old frail and needs nurture a lot of tlc

1860582 basically his idea is that language itself creates reality for example in order to have words like nouns you have to have concepts when you form concepts thats when youre creating stuff its a creative process you pick out certain things from the environment and you give them labels and you create this reality around you when youre a kid youre learing how to perceive a reality its almost like a computer language an internal code that makes you able to think from a linguistic point of view this is a very old concept and a lot of people nowadays dont believe it but i think its probably to some degree true perhaps if you dont have a word for a certain feeling or a certain color of the sky then you dont notice it it doesnt stick out from the background thats what words do they make things stick out otherwise it might just be a big haze of data in a computer language youd call it uninterpreted data so a language is your browser

1860656 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1860657 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1860658 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1860659 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1860660 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1860661 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
1860662 at every meal the scene is replayed are you drinking
1860663 its on the fringes of the first amendment but there is some protection
1860664 however this case doesnt seem to fit the bill because this was a minor child and a minor child in a nude performance is not protected
1860665 thats really stretching it it was a bar it was a minor child that got up spontaneously to do a nude dance that is not protected
1860666 this is a tragic situation because a minor was involved
1860667 this judge must be brain dead revoke the license of the bar and charge them with child abuse what is the matter with the people in iowa my new friends the only way to fight this is with good ole prayer doesnt matter what you believe we just need to pray prayers of our belief pray
1860668 let me guess who appointed this judge ogrady a democrat right so what else should we expect they are all loons
1860669 wonder who let the underage minor into the bar stripclub in the first place this bar club needs to have its license taken away immediately next this community has a judge for which impeachment would be merciful
1860670 what a comentary on the times we are living in allowing a minor in a bar is one thing but allowing her to strip is quite another for a judge to even hint that there is 1st ammendment protection in this case is mind boggling at the very least the bar should have their liquor beer licenses revoked forever
1860671 less than this is used to take children away from their parents but this is ok for a bar to profit from that judge is an idiot
1860672 absolutely no common sense in these types of rulings another case of the laws of this country not being enforced by those with the power to do so we really have a breakdown in our society when our laws are ignored at all levels and lawbreakers are not held responsible for their behavior from the child molesters esp in vt to the crazies out in traffic on our highways to executive who rape the govt to politicians who break the laws and rob the public and so on and on it is demoralizing and encourages more of the same at all levels there is no shame and no belief in any god other than the self and the ego
1860673 im with the first writer the mere fact that the girl is 17 a fact that appears to be established means that the bar should have its license revoked
1860674 that judge needs to be publicly flogged then disbared and serve time in the prison with the other perverts
1860675 sad scary insane perverted just when exactly did law become synonymous with loopholes
1860676 the judge needs to be disbarred and some arrests need to be made here
1860677 the judge needs to be impeached club needs to be charged with child abuse and contributing to the delinquency of a minor and if she had anything to drink serving alcohol to a minor then pull their business license this is abominable
1860678 i while back i made the comment that once homosexuality is accepted sex with children will be the next
1860679 okay that judge needs to be booted out for his ignorance
1860680 how much more do we need to hear before we recognize that our country will be lost destroyed by our peoples lack of respect for faith morality and gods commandments
1860681 there should be criminal charges in this case the parents of this 17 year old child must be held liable for allowing her to enter the theater the girl herself should be in juvi jail for presenting false id what is wrong with the morals of people living in iowa
1860682 if it was a bar and a minor was allowed in they need to have their liquor license revoked that would pretty much shut them down
1860683 n kan du ta det roolig de neste hundre r
1860684 i said to him we want to give you what you need not what you want you need to re examine your ideology and you need someone to advise you why should i believe i have a duty to support al qaeda how islamically did they establish their authority
1860685 oh you young people do not be deceived by the heroes of the internet the leaders of the microphones who are launching statements inciting the youth while living under the protection of intelligence services or of a tribe or in a distant cave or under political asylum in an infidel country
1860686 they have thrown many others before you into the infernos graves and prisons those who have triggered clashes and pressed their brothers into unequal military confrontations are specialists neither in fatwas nor in military affairs
1860687 i think theres a lack of communication and i think that until we get this individual involvement from politicians and ministers and other people to come down and in this safe space have a critical dialogue were going to get young people who are going to try to vent their frustration elsewhere
1860688 our dog kinda started running away and we were getting ready to leave
1860689 so she went down there to get the dog when it ran down by the car in the course of picking up the dog she saw what appeared to be somebody in the car hunched over
1860690 they said yes and i told them to step on it because theres a body in the car
1860691 possibly could of had a heart attack could of got sick his address is further east from here possibly could of gotten disorientated and ended up behind this residence

1860703 we surveyed 100 people and asked them to think of something red
1860704 between 2003 and 2007 exxon paid 64 7 billion in u s taxes exceeding its after tax u s earnings by more than 19 billion that sounds like a government windfall to us emphasis mine but perhaps were missing some obama durbin subtlety
1860705 impose a 25 windfall tax on a u s based oil company whose profits grew by more than 10 in a single year and wasnt invested enough in renewable energy
1860706 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule

1860727 i often get women in the clinic who have had eight or more children and are desperate to stop
1860728 they are all too pleased to have a break and family planning can allow that to happen but there is a huge unmet need for these facilities here and that needs to change

1860730 a woman in the village of andavadoaka who wanted to access contraceptive services faced a 50km journey on foot to morombe the nearest town or would have to pay for passage on a passing ship
1860731 in cities there are good contraceptive services available in remote areas like ours most organisations cant offer a service
1860732 the work being done by bvc to enable coastal communities to manage their resources sustainably ran the risk of being undermined by the mushrooming population of the community
1860733 in addition an awareness of sexually transmissible infections and a willingness to take precautions was low
1860734 it is only through the sensibilisation of communities that we can get behavioural change
1860735 as long as peoples behaviour doesnt change there is no way of reaching the goals laid out by the government in the madagascar action plan
1860736 society here still lacks some understanding of what womens rights are
1860737 we are raising awareness not just about womens rights but about their economic and social interests and about how they can take control of their lives
1860738 it allows us to control when we give birth here some women become pregnant every year
1860739 between 2004 and 2006 we saw a significant increase in the use of family planning the government is encouraging organisations like psi to increase their work
1860740 we must have services made available permanently to those people who need them
1860741 services must be permanent not just available once in a while
1860742 i think that the targets of the map are reachable
1860743 but not with the governments efforts alone it has to be with all partners involved in family planning in madagascar
1860744 even a small impact in a remote community can have a ripple effect in terms of helping to spread understanding and raise awareness of the issue everything counts family planning is really needed here

1860861 i like how iw seems to know whats best for the community and is the one to stomp on all the good stuff
1860862 its our job to hopefully know what makes good gameplay
1860863 ctf okay we know you have said it wouldnt work well in cod4 and i know you are not a fan of ctf but there is clearly a desire from 1000s of fans who would love to see this gametype implemented why are they being ignored
1860864 map competition why is this taking so long thats all we would like to know getting prizes together doesnt take nearly 6 months
1860865 future dlc gametypes please any official word confirm deny any future map packs or gametypes will be added to cod4
1860866 youre only going to be compared to what other companies are doing regardless of whether or not they produced the game of the year
1860867 what frustrates me is seeing the next batch of dlc become available for
1860868 what a missed oppertunity the game has been so popular they could have made a fortune out of map packs rediculous absolutely rediculous it will be cod4 r i p come november and gow2
1860869 we use community feedback to help tweak and polish the game further after launch
1860870 i played cod4 online yesterday for the first time in months a few of my friends were playing it for some reason so i thought what the hell boy do i remember why i stopped playing in the first place nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong

1860875 what the f k is all that noise this early in the morning
1860876 you must have an active internet connection to play online or via systemlink
1860877 i know it sucks there wont be trophies in cod4 we wish we had the flexibility in our production schedule to add them but we dont spamming comments forums isnt going to free up time in the production schedule
1860878 were excited to announce that in the recent months we have decided to reup on our contract with activision publishing
1860879 ini bukanlah masalah berat absolutnya tapi tergantung berapa lama anda memegangnya
1860880 jika saya memegangnya selama 1 menit tidak ada masalah jika saya memegangnya selama 1 jam lengan kanan saya akan sakit dan jika saya memegangnya selama 1 hari penuh mungkin anda harus memanggilkan ambulans untuk saya beratnya sebenarnya sama tapi semakin lama saya memegangnya maka bebannya akan semakin berat
1860881 jika kita membawa beban kita terus menerus lambat laun kita tidak akan mampu membawanya lagi beban itu akan meningkat beratnya
1860882 apa yang harus kita lakukan adalah meletakkan gelas tersebut istirahat sejenak sebelum mengangkatnya lagi

1860891 i apologize if youre having trouble logging in if you are please send me an email to
1860892 a patch development time relies solely on the feature bugs being addressed in said patch
1860893 i would love to go in depth on how 3rd party developer support works but the reality is that the support for rumble trophy xmb etc has come far too late in the production life of call of duty 4 modern warfare to feasibly add in any of those features the game has shipped and were a fairly small team under 100 people in comparison its not that its not possible its that we cant add such a major feature to a shipped title and maintain our current production schedule with our current team size its just not feasible i wish it were i wish the tools were available to add such features while call of duty 4 modern warfare was in development
1860894 im too smart for the 1st grade my sister is in the 3rd grade and im smarter than she is i think i should be in the 3rd grade too

1860903 im not going to have some reporters pawing through our papers we are the president
1860904 that lowdown scoundrel deserves to be kicked to death by a jackass and im just the one to do it
1860905 it isnt pollution thats harming the environment its the impurities in our air and water that are doing it
1860906 weve got to pause and ask ourselves how much clean air do we need
1860907 we dont necessarily discriminate we simply exclude certain types of people
1860908 if we dont succeed we run the risk of failure
1860909 we are ready for an unforeseen event that may or may not occur

1860912 our ceo has been ripped off in the past by freelancers so doesnt like to pay deposits so we did a deal that we would send over initial concepts then we would recieve the deposit that we asked for

1860915 we didnt go half baked we knew what we were doing with larger customers there are a lot of competitors
1860916 but when you go to mid market companies theres not much competition
1860917 with such a big client reference life became a lot easier
1860918 were thrilled with that we have no hesitation to have a large auto related business
1860919 who dont have the it budget that companies like syntel generally look for
1860920 one is forbes global 2000 companies the companies everyone is chasing because they spend so much on it no 2 is the european sector which is 12 to 24 months behind the u s in it outsourcing no 3 is from small and midsized businesses
1860921 with global bpo were looking at annual growth of 25 to 30 percent
1860922 i had a great job at gm but you could see where you were going to end up in 30 years it didnt seem exciting enough
1860923 he was the technology brains i was the process and business side of things and we pulled it together
1860924 we gave them a call compared them to some competitors and chose them weve since extended the relationship twice and as other projects arise im sure well use them on those too
1860925 with some contractors they come in deploy and are gone then you get nickeled and dimed on follow ups but we built a relationship with them they did knowledge transfer to our employees they didnt just throw something over the wall
1860926 i was incredibly excited about their acquiring us it provided us a resource pool that we didnt have before
1860927 they invested money in us that let us do what we always thought wed be capable of doing i expected that

1860937 protecting americas freedoms at home and abroad securing our homeland and defending democracy worldwide
1860938 i am a guardian of freedom and the american way of life
1860939 this phrase defines the honesty and dedication of the marines for their work of protecting the u s a
1860940 men and women to join their organization who are ready to fight for their country and protect their people
1860941 those who have gone before me to defend freedom and democracy around the world
1860942 the military protects your freedom from those who would take it
1860943 i disagree more and more of my freedoms are disappearing through actions initiated by the government that claims to represent me
1860944 i stay very well informed on such matters and i agree many areas of the government have overstepped their constitutional authority and damaged or taken some of your freedoms however the military did not take those illegal actions other areas of the government did
1860945 agreed but earlier you claimed unequivocally that the military protects my freedom you have agreed with my assertion that my freedoms are quickly disappearing therefore i can conclude that the military despite their claims to the contrary is not protecting my freedom the military may not have the authority to counter other rogue elements of the government that threaten my freedom but that fact is irrelevant what is relevant is the fact that my freedom is not being protected and you claim the military is protecting my freedom im not so much upset that the military cant through legal restrictions defend my freedom as i am that they claim they do protect my freedom when the military claims to protect my freedom they do so without listing any qualifiers or exceptions therefore the military and its supporters are promoting a lie
1860946 the military protects and defends the us constitution in obedience to its members pledge to defend it
1860947 i disagree many areas of the government have damaged taken and continue to threaten my liberties guaranteed under the us constitution you have previously agreed to this claim but the military makes no effort to protect or rectify these abuses it cannot do so because it lacks the legal authority to interfere in the activities of other areas of the government yet the military claims it does protect the us constitution and therefore protects the individuals safeguarded by that document amp 183 clearly as these examples prove the military does not and can not the military is telling a lie
1860948 in addition the military continues to execute acts of war against other states without the declaration of defending the constitution at the same time it is actively violating it the military may be excused for not having the authority to question or refuse participation in such illegal actions it is in effect impotent but by not having this authority to refuse participation it is clearly unable to take steps that would stop such an action the military claims to defend the constitution without offering any qualifiers or exceptions therefore this unequivocal categorical claim is a lie
1860949 the military protects your freedom when it is legally allowed to do so

1860980 when im president im not going to let them go on vacation
1860981 all i wanted to do was achieve cult status i made it we can go anywhere and they know me
1860982 our goal was to be banned from everywhere we played
1860983 i just really wanted to be as aggressive as possible i couldnt afford therapy i got my aggression out on the audience i was an alcohol influenced madman
1860984 but under it all we just wanted to be cool to have cult status we wanted to get there making our own rules
1860985 people i grew up with are selling cars and insurance im not for me the good old days are still going on
1860986 being in a band is like being married to four people at once
1860987 i can give you a list of about 75 people i wouldnt want you to talk to

1860989 i do it less now what with having a day job even i have to have some responsibility to keep a roof over our heads
1860990 im a showman i dont know what makes me a performer its a weird mix of ego and exhibitionism i enjoy the performance
1860991 bloody is a performer im him 90 percent of the time i crossed over a long time ago

1861000 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
1861001 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country and is going to revolutionize the houseboat industry people are increasingly worried about high gas prices and this is the answer
1861002 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
1861003 barack smiled tears rolling down his cheeks suddenly he knew for certain hope would last long enough
1861004 come november barack obama has got my vote and no matter what happens in the election he is a man who has made history the first man of color to win a major party nomination for president of the united states
1861005 i am the way and the truth and the life no one can receive hope and change except through me
1861006 i want to be president because i was hit in the head
1861007 weve been so focused on iraq and we all know afghanistan has not received the attention and resources it needs
1861008 we are where we are but not where we should be after 9 11 we spent a little time here and left it would have been better if wed spent more resources here we didnt and that cant be undone but we are in a better position now i feel were in pretty good shape
1861009 were not attempting to win this war with sheer military power
1861010 many of the most successful drives against the taliban have been conducted by american forces redeployed from iraq in particular from anbar province but these military victories are the result of counterinsurgent tactics and strategies that were learned in iraq and that have been applied triumphantly in afghanistan
1861011 were not attempting to win this war with sheer military power
1861012 weve been so focused on iraq and we all know afghanistan has not received the attention and resources it needs
1861013 people who have fought the civil rights battle politically economically legally as we have since the 50s would often talk about look what would happen if we had an african american president or chairpersons of major congressional committees
1861014 it doesnt look like its going to be what we all thought it would be
1861015 when i saw him over a year ago on c span vigorously opposed to the impeachment of bush and cheny vigorously opposed
1861016 his handlers said mccain is scoring here so he blurs he blurs
1861017 he blurs and blurs and blurs and blurs some more
1861018 whos on the dollar bill in ralph naders mind eldridge cleaver
1861019 people who have fought the civil rights battle politically economically legally as we have since the 50s would often talk about look what would happen if we had an african american president or chairpersons of major congressional committees
1861020 it doesnt look like its going to be what we all thought it would be
1861021 asif ali zardari and nawaz sharif at tuesdays meeting discussed the issue of restoration of judges and other political matters but i cannot go into details
1861022 just because a country has a nuclear bomb does not mean that we automatically can not fight a war with them
1861023 do what we say or we will kill tens of millions of your citizens
1861024 i dont like war interesting that you say it worked from 1945 until today why not 1944 because the nuclear bomb we did use ended a war and prevented a lot of dead american soldiers
1861025 just because a country has a nuclear bomb does not mean that we automatically can not fight a war with them
1861026 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
1861027 i happen to believe that well come out stronger if people think that their voices are heard no decisions have been made
1861028 theyre going to have themselves a big march during the convention too
1861029 she ran an awful campaign and got beat by a better candidate black man who also ran an awful campaign but had the advantage of being black
1861030 im not going to say that i told you so
1861031 mccain seems intent on reassuring skeptics that hes no george w bush
1861032 im john mccain aka the old white haired dude and i approved this message
1861033 yes im an old white haired dude but id be honored to be counted in their company
1861034 sounds like paris has a better energy plan than obama
1861035 im john mccain aka the old white haired dude and i approved this message
1861036 yes im an old white haired dude but id be honored to be counted in their company
1861037 perhaps the most interesting finding of these polls is that mccain has expanded his leads on nearly every issue he had previously had the advantage on while obamas leads have diminished over the past two weeks
1861038 mr mccain seems intent on reassuring skeptics that hes no george w bush if he loses in november hell prove it
1861039 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1861040 i just produced more gas than obamas plan will ever save us
1861041 i just produced more gas than obamas plan will ever save us
1861042 solve anything other than putting in the pockets of him and his friends while bringing the golden goose to its knees
1861043 a pair of gimmicks would be a big improvement for obama
1861044 it should be mandatory to run your own business before holding office
1861045 we will cut back on domestic production if you increase taxes on us its time big oil and big business in general start standing up for themselves and taking their message to the people if i were a ceo i would do like wal mart did and tell my employees the price
1861046 increasing taxation on something you want more of oil production in order to subsidize something you want less of oil use is pretty stupid
1861047 want to see oil company profits put to better use allow them to drill in the ocs and interior it will create hundreds of thousands of jobs now and will produce oil within two to three years that will produce long term energy security while we continue to pursue energy alternatives those are real solutions not gimmicks
1861048 oh so he claims he supported the bill because it had a provision for green energy
1861049 environment minister sigmar gabriel should cease lashing out at all those who scrutinize the future of the power supply and energy security
1861050 it is vital that an industrialized country with 82 million inhabitants not march blindly into the
1861051 we are not extremists and this ad is racist now take it back or we will be forced to destroy you
1861052 you now have a vested interest in the safety of those people because if anything untoward happens to them guess what
1861053 it could be an effective way to change the behavior of us officials
1861054 find out where he the al arian case prosecutor lives find out where his kids go to school they cant take the heat deliver it to them
1861055 it could be an effective way to change the behavior of us officials
1861056 the cartoons were not simply stuck in the middle of the magazine with no purpose or related story
1861057 i havent been given my freedom of the press ive simply had the government censor approve what i said thats a completely different thing
1861058 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
1861059 i havent been given my freedom of the press ive simply had the government censor approve what i said thats a completely different thing
1861060 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
1861061 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
1861062 should be run out of canada preferably northward with pitch forks tar and feathers to be food for the polar bears
1861063 i feel that at times you can harm the person that you are trying to help
1861064 he actually seems to transform himself becoming what must be next he has been called distant aloof and somewhat unapproachable perhaps because we cannot approach what he does not have a solid core
1861065 senator mccain yesterday was saying that his solution to americas energy challenge was to drill drill drill well that sounded a lot like my dentist to me look even arnold schwarznegger the governator whos known for being a fairly straight shooter says that drilling alone is not the answer to americans energy challenge
1861066 we need to give an energy rebate to families to give them some immediate relief the mother who is having to cut back on groceries because of rising gas prices the guy i met who couldnt fill up his gas tank to go on a job search didnt have the money ive said that we need a 1 000 rebate energy rebate to provide families a little bit of relief over the next four to six months
1861067 how does your new 1000 rebate differ from buying off votes from people your trying to bribe them with someone elses money
1861068 you put your finger in your ear and go ting a ling a loo
1861069 see i can be jerk for bho pick me pick me
1861070 congressman xs vote means youre going to pay more taxes this year
1861071 were tracking the ever so elusive mark udall some say that he can be seen leaving the capitol in washington and we might be able to catch a glimpse of him in or about his office
1861072 we have followed a rather intrepid crowd of people staked out at the colorado airport they are holding signs and chanting its extraordinary
1861073 but now it seems that he was spotted just look at this footage that shows mark udall if only for a fleeting few seconds
1861074 its difficult to make out but it seems that mark udall is indeed starting his 5 week vacation
1861075 waahhhhhh we couldnt pass legislation because the evil bushitler wouldnt call us back from our vacation waahhhhhh
1861076 lets see attend fundraiser or carry out my responsibility to my constituents hmmmm dilemma
1861077 got to get back to the wife and kids you understand
1861078 you and we are different races we have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other 2 races even when you cease to be slaves you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race you are cut off from many of the advantages which the other race enjoys it is better for us both to be separated
1861079 all men are created equal except negroes foreigners and catholics
1861080 when you grow up in a very regimented system the lower you go the easier it is to train
1861081 only obstinacy could cloud judgment now and if the new york times can get over that so can barack obama and the democrats
1861082 years to develop a quality nco corps and decades to train the higher echelons
1861083 when you grow up in a very regimented system the lower you go the easier it is to train
1861084 you apparently believe that the us wants to stay in iraq forever im guessing that is the result of your super psychic powers that allow you to tell when people are not saying what they really believe
1861085 there is nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things
1861086 imperialistic motives can be more diverse than wanting to lower the price of gasoline
1861087 personally i believe that obama is willing to withdraw all military from iraq
1861088 extending the rule of an empire over a foreign country
1861089 i miei homers comincio a prepararli durante la settimana lavorando duro perch in allenamento che prepari la mente a vincere le partite

1861144 for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard after agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day he sent them into his vineyard and going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and to them he said you go into the vineyard too and whatever is right i will give you so they went going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour he did the same and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing and he said to them why do you stand here idle all day they said to him because no one has hired us he said to them you go into the vineyard too and when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman call the laborers and pay them their wages beginning with the last up to the first and when those hired about the eleventh hour came each of them received a denarius now when those hired first came they thought they would receive more but each of them also received a denarius and on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house saying these last worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat but he replied to one of them friend i am doing you no wrong did you not agree with me for a denarius take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last worker as i give to you am i not allowed to do what i choose with what belongs to me or do you begrudge my generosity so the last will be first and the first last

1861148 as soon as our story includes an extraneous element we become suspects and are condemned very often to a kafkaesque administrative journey
1861149 pure xenophobia which reflects an exclusive idea as opposed to an inclusive one of nationality
1861150 there is within certain administrations that deal with legal decisions relating to nationality a will whether conscious or unconscious to protect the race once i submitted more than ten files for recognition of nationality for young africans whose fathers were incontestably french but for whom the court refused to deliver a certificate of citizenship it goes on all the time
1861151 origin is made sacred as if there was an essence to being french that we needed to protect from being soiled
1861152 which is why any person born abroad or of foreign born parents is under suspicion which is why there is an obsessive fear that the race might be contaminated and why there is a pathological need for documents which attest to its purety
1861153 for the past five years consumers in california have been willing to pay twice as much for oysters from the northeastern atlantic coast as for gulf coast oysters this trend began shortly after harmful bacteria were found in a few raw gulf coast oysters but scientists have now devised a process for killing the bacteria once consumers are made aware of the increased safety of gulf coast oysters they are likely to be willing to pay as much for gulf coast as for northeastern atlantic coast oysters and greater profits for gulf coast oyster producers will follow

1861274 the e 520 may well be the most flexible consumer dslr weve reviewed this year whereas the nikon d60 proved to be an excellent first slr and new models from canon and pentax have aimed to appeal to a slightly more advanced audience the e 520 does both at once
1861275 at iso 800 the image is holding up very well but you cannot deny noise is present in the very darkest areas and speckling of lighter areas at iso 1600 you can readily see the quite intrusive speckling of noise but to my eyes it is not that distracting and is no worse than film grain would be at iso800 and does not unduly detract from the image
1861276 pros egood color accuracy low optical distortion consistent sharpness from corner to corner very fast and responsive comfortable design great lcd visibility pros 18x optical zoom optical image stabilization full manual mode raw support panasonic lumix dmc fz18 and writes
1861277 color saturation is well controlled and though its less saturated than the competition we dont notice that it makes images less appealing exposure tends to jump around a bit but its not bad high iso performance is a little weak especially in tungsten lighting its long zooms where high iso is so important so this problem is unfortunate
1861278 he panasonic lumix dmc fz18 is an impressive ultra zoom digital camera and probably the best of the latest ultra zoom cameras thanks to the leica wide angle 18x optical zoom lens i didnt notice any vignetting or distortion and image quality is very good with great colour and detail although noise and lack of detail at the higher iso settings causes some concern the camera offers an excellent leica wide angle 18x optical zoom lens with optical image stabilisation helping you get sharp crisp blur free images even in low light
1861279 the good wide angle long zoom lens nice set of shooting features the bad cameras jpeg processing choices can produce suboptimal results no zoom in movie capture sluggish lcd evf update
1861280 the overall image quality when using the 8m fine mode was very good for a consumer model the majority of our images are tach sharp with very little edge softness exposure is accurate and color saturation is very pleasing the camera also performs well indoors
1861281 color accuracy in low light suffers a bit but is better than many cameras noise levels are quite high in low light at such a high iso speed which may occasionally be your only option to capture a dimly lit scene without blur or flash the main problem with the fz18 in low light is its inconsistent autofocus
1861282 image quality is excellent with virtually no distortion at any focal length even at wide angle parallels were perfectly straight in all our test shots chromatic aberration or purple fringing is practically non existent and there is no sign of vignetting in the extreme corners of the image colours are natural without being overly saturated
1861283 mage quality always seems to be the most disappointing part of panasonics recent cameras and that hasnt changed on the fz18 on the positive side the camera takes well exposed photos with accurate though somewhat dull color and almost zero purple fringing
1861284 behind its austere design the panasonic dmc fz18 hides impressive high level performance experienced photographers will find a camera thats the perfect compromise between compact point and shoots that are too short of features and slrs that are too expensive and perhaps over laden with features they will never use
1861285 the good intelligent auto mode was spot on most of the time solid build good overall performance the bad no hotshoe no flip out screen
1861286 the af works very well in low light and the af assist lamp makes for precise and fast focus lock overall very good to excellent image quality for a 8 1mp digital camera sharp pictures good image detail beautiful colours well exposed
1861287 overall most casual photographers and even some enthusiasts will be very happy with the image quality from the fz18
1861288 panasonic is pleased to introduce the new dmc fz18 8
1861289 iso induced noise is decently well controlled up through iso 400 though even at this relatively low setting theres an alarming amount of blotchiness in solid field areas
1861290 the camera produces very good images that are colourful pleasing richly saturated with good exposure and noise is generally low given the excellent value for money this camera provides and the almost endless features id highly recommend this camera
1861291 there is no question that the military commissions have jurisdiction over the crime of
1861292 intentionally kill ing one or more persons including lawful combatants in violation of the law of war

1861298 so lisa how has it been being the main producer for this single was it difficult confusing stressful
1861299 so where did you get the idea for the lyrics and choreography of this new single did you get any ideas from what happened last year
1861300 thanks lisa so is there a few more things youd like to tell us before we have to end this show
1861301 how will the coming recession affect your ability to invest
1861302 ah ha moments watching los van van videos at lula while djing live blogging with the typepad software checking phone messages in the order you want retrieving phone numbers while talking on the phone the twitterific app taking a photo and emailing it to a friend
1861303 music generally regarded as having permanent rather than ephemeral value the opposite of light or popular music
1861304 if we in canada are going to be honest with ourselves were going to want a world in which classical music represents more diversity
1861305 wonderful in that it mixes experimental music of all kinds
1861306 to see the opening band read all the music from a music stand was the funniest thing they had ever seen
1861307 im fucking sick to death of fans not knowing where there money is going when they buy a cd steve albini has the right idea to expose this shit once and for all i mean a percentage of your money is going to the fucking retarded bitch sitting behind the counter at the hmv tower wherever she is on the phone painting her fucking nails and couldnt even tell you where the metal section is if you asked her so what if we sell less records being totally independent at least now with berzerker industries if people want to support us by not downloading our music they can
1861308 havana nocturne how the mob owned cuba and then lost it to the revolution
1861309 were thrilled to let the world know that we have signed a record deal with napalm records from the beginning we had a very good feeling about all negotiations and talking to the nice people of napalm now its the time to let you all know that a new chapter in the sop history is about to be written
1861310 we are writing this album as a progression from our previous works and it definately shows more muscial maturity
1861311 we are not going to talk about soccer because we simply dont get it
1861312 who would have thought the tfc would be such a popular phenomena
1861313 we demand the best for our children even if you dont
1861314 we have a very solid case that is based on documented evidence directly from the district
1861315 we want to take everything that they have because they have taken everything that we have when they abuse and neglect our children we want what is coming to us and our children
1861316 people who date marry interracially and throw in internationally too only do it for ulterior motives
1861317 god never called us to be superheroes its not our job to fix everything and to know every solution its time to retire the cape and give god control once again
1861318 it wont get better so whats the use in believing
1861319 he may not come when you want him but hell be there right on time
1861320 how in the world will i ever have stability again when will things come together for me
1861321 its not too late its not too far gone its not too bad i will recover
1861322 do not remember the former things nor consider the things of old behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it i will even make a road in the wilderness and rivers in the desert
1861323 see you got yourself all worked up for nothing i knew things would work out all right
1861324 have not i commanded you be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be you dismayed for the lord your god is with you wherever you go
1861325 no more will i allow fear to stop me and if i fail it wont be because i was too afraid to try
1861326 31 youve thought more than ten times that the car you have just seen was driven by nobody
1861327 im trying to spread the word about amendment 1 in my farm area
1861328 telling folks that if theyve felt like prisoners in their homes due to the potential for high taxation nows the time to move into a new home
1861329 now may be the right time for you to move and take advantage of the portability that this amendment affords you
1861330 they wanted to bring the property tax savings with them to cape coral
1861331 and were able to do that thanks to the new law
1861332 and this new portability was an answer to that need
1861333 these types of buyers need a push to realize that the best move is to go ahead and purchase now
1861334 we tune them in to the issue by giving them details on the law and what it means for them as buyers or sellers
1861335 i think it can be reasonably forecasted that the market will once again heat up as a result of this change
1861336 when they have substantial save our homes benefits theyre probably on the fence about selling right now
1861337 the portability factor could be the incentive they need to make the move
1861338 realize that the tax base varies by municipality city and county and that you dont have to put yourself in the position of answering every question for your client
1861339 you can simply inform them that the portability amendment has passed explain what it means and then direct them to their local government web site or property appraisers office have this information on hand for customers for more details
1861340 ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you
1861341 i think the raising of fha limits is going to help not only buyers in our area but it will also generate activity across the nation
1861342 when the market was hot first time buyers really couldnt buy property because they were being outbid by investors this will bring the average american back to the homebuying market
1861343 buyers need to hear something positive so i started going through my contact list and letting them know that the fha loan limits had been raised and that the change would help them get more of a home than they could afford before
1861344 i say if you could normally afford a 350 000 home this might allow you to get a home up to 375 000
1861345 i had two people who were looking at renting and once i explained the fha program it piqued their interest in buying today rather than waiting two years
1861346 im hopeful this will open doors to buyers who havent been able to buy
1861347 and maybe the people i sent it to arent in the market themselves but they may have a son or daughter who can afford to buy but who doesnt have the cash for the down payment and the parents can help out
1861348 anything going out to my database that helps people understand that im still in the marketplace and shows im working hard for them that helps
1861349 so its a simple conversation with the sales associate and buyers in the car between showings
1861350 ive begun to target first time buyers more frequently to take advantage of the possibility of putting clients into a house with very little money down
1861351 i even take it a step further and tell them about no money down options through government down payment assistance programs with some programs like the nehemiah program the dream homeownership program and family home providers sellers can contribute up to 3 percent of the purchase price
1861352 there are definitely people in our area that the new fha limits will help
1861353 but lenders still have standards that need to be met and we all know how tight those standards have become also the increased loan limits do nothing for people who are saddled with selling a house to be able to move into another house its like the corner candy store in a small town it may double its size but how much candy can people in that area buy
1861354 probably the biggest issue especially for younger buyers is the ability to get a down payment together
1861355 with not for profit down payment assistance programs buyers with a decent job and good credit can get into a house for as little as 500 that makes a huge difference and it makes it possible for quite a few people to buy
1861356 its not normal for women to be skinny throughout pregnancy but they are seeing pictures in the media that say something completely the opposite
1861357 a normal pregnancy shape is chunkier and bumpier but women dont like that look in tight maternity clothes
1861358 there seems to be a real sense of competition to get back to pre baby shape as soon as possible which is not realistic and certainly not healthy
1861359 i saw him and i couldnt believe the resemblance so i asked him are you who i think you are he said who do you think i am so i said paul mccartney and he said no but i think thats because there were other people in the store
1861360 i asked him for his autograph and he gave it to me he was very nice he was here for about 15 minutes he didnt want to stay very long he probably didnt want you guys the press to know about him
1861361 he was driving a green suv type vehicle and there was a lady in the front seat but i couldnt tell who she was
1861362 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging

1861392 putting the world into world class education a forum for policymakers and practitioners
1861393 to provide leadership and structure to move international education from the margins to the mainstream by connecting stakeholders issues and policies in order to prepare k 12 students to excel in an interconnected world
1861394 we are born to connect and how we connect with others has unimagined significance
1861395 i want to provide some sense of the importance of preserving and taking care of these textiles even if they are old and fraying we can still learn from them by using the patterns to create new designs
1861396 most lao women tend to overlook the beauty inherent in our everyday dress we take our sinh for granted as we see our aunts mothers and sisters wearing them all the time but when you travel overseas you come to understand youre wearing something really special our clothing is nothing like that worn in most countries and most of all it lets people know were from laos
1861397 i discovered that they were buying them for exhibitions in their home countries i talked to some of the sellers i met trying to persuade them not to part with their old finery so that we would not lose our heritage and our children would have the chance to see these wonderful designs since then i have pioneered the collection of these textiles so that we can preserve and show them to others in the hope that it will open their eyes to their significance in our culture
1861398 the tai daeng have not only developed outstanding designs but they are industrious weavers and keep their traditional skills alive
1861399 the fine quality of workmanship and the particular designs of these weavers are recognised not only in laos but around the world their weaving skills are still growing because most women here continue to wear their traditional costumes and use textiles in almost every aspect of their daily lives
1861400 this kind of practice is damaging i understand that this is a long standing custom but we need to realise that if the best pieces are burnt its almost impossible for anyone to replicate them afterwards
1861401 i remember when my sister died that all of her best clothes were burned and i was sorry to see them go now ive learned to ask for clothes from my relatives in advance
1861402 fine mr quest but from now on you address me as major
1861403 till i saw your soldiers destroying women and shooting old men
1861404 everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific literary or artistic production of which he is the author
1861405 leaving school before completing the term is a troubling enduring problem that the education section cannot seem to solve in xieng khuang province
1861406 one problem is that the teachers still lack the ability to control the students in the classroom and to keep track of absent students they cant communicate with the parents due to distance and lack of phone service the decreasing number of students in the middle of the year both in primary and secondary schools is a problem we need to address quickly
1861407 we hope to help the poor families by supplying school materials to them for free because many families in remote areas live in poverty and cant send their children to school they just play at home and help their parents with their work this is generally why children leave school unwillingly
1861408 although the number of primary and secondary school students decreased in some provinces a few years ago in the 2005 2006 academic year the percentage of children aged six to eight attending school across the country reached 85 percent if we plan to succeed the number will rise to 88 percent in 2010

1861411 there was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet proof vest
1861412 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
1861413 mistress indicates that pet is below everyone else talk about harshly lowering pet into pets place or is this just a start as pet is to be lowered farther
1861414 then again if other women are worthless and pet is below everyone else what does that make pet
1861415 also should pet speak first on messenger if pet sees mistress online or just wait until spoken to there as well
1861416 ahh if the craftsmen bent their efforts to saving the poor rather that sculpting for the rich the world would be a happier place

1861445 i have read the new rumor on goonies 2 and all i can say of that is i have checked my sources and as for now it still does not exist however i would love to be proven wrong
1861446 i am very happy to receive an identity at my age
1861447 keep it with me always in a safe place so that no one can take it away from me
1861448 with these cards refugees will be able to identify themselves as people legally permitted to reside in bangladesh if they meet law enforcement officials
1861449 i am very pleased and never thought myself and my family would ever receive an id card
1861450 for us the id cards are really a milestone in recognizing each and every refugee and their individual rights
1861451 they finally exist as individual refugees and are no longer lumped together as a group
1861452 womens groups are demanding a 35 percent quota in representation in the government which would allow for issues such as the custody and nationality law to take precedence
1861453 however the issue is not about how many women are married to palestinians syrians or other foreigners but that they have to amend this law to highlight that this is a human right
1861454 i asked why they need his father when i am his mother and want an account for my son they told me that only the father can open the account i couldnt believe it

1861487 overall im very happy with our effort and the win we were able to play a bunch of kids here on homecomng night and thats always a good thing theres a lot for us to be pleased with tonight
1861488 we like to run the football but when we can throw it with the kind of success that we did tonight that can make us a tough team to handle offensively

1861496 its time to engage in diplomatic efforts to help build a new lebanese consensus that focuses on electoral reform an end to the current corrupt patronage system and the development of the economy that provides for a fair distribution of services opportunities and employment
1861497 its a destabilising organisation by any common sense standard this wouldnt happen without the support of iran and syria
1861498 find a mechanism whereby the disaffected have an effective outlet for their grievances which assures them they are getting social services
1861499 theyre going down a blind alley with violence that weakens their legitimate claims
1861500 if they decide to shift were going to recognise that thats an evolution that should be recognised
1861501 the debate were going to be having with john mccain is how do we understand the blend of military action to diplomatic action that we are going to undertake
1861502 i constantly reject this notion that any hint of strategies involving diplomacy are somehow soft or indicate surrender or means that you are not going to crack down on terrorism those are the terms of debate that have led to blunder after blunder
1861503 the generals are light years ahead of the civilians they are trying to get the job done rather than look tough
1861504 if your opponents are looking for your destruction its hard to sit across the table from them
1861505 there are rarely purely ideological movements out there we can encourage actors to think in practical and not ideological terms we can strengthen those elements that are making practical calculations
1861506 its an argument between ideology and foreign policy realism i have enormous sympathy for the foreign policy of george h w bush i dont have a lot of complaints about their handling of desert storm i dont have a lot of complaints with their handling of the fall of the berlin wall
1861507 im like a back catcher flash a sign and they throw suttin at cha

1861917 that has now come down to 81 9c which is a reduction of 15 4c
1861918 to cut to the chase on tuesday the average price for that same period had fallen by 15c to an average of 144 4c
1861919 for motorists it is very confusing and if they are still seeing prices up around 162c they are upset the prices arent coming down
1861920 it is extremely difficult and that is the benefit of fuelwatch
1861921 there was a 27c per litre range in sydney yesterday some petrol retailers may not pass on the reductions in wholesale prices as quickly as others
1861922 those particular retailers are outed using the fuelwatch system at the moment they keep prices higher until someone is cheaper
1861923 we will probably see prices down below 1 30 soon and over this coming week well see the national average price down to 1 25
1861924 it is starting to work its way down theres should be another 5c to 10c of savings coming for motorists to enjoy
1861925 we have a watchdog that has bark but no bite
1861926 we hope his replacement is going to be aggressive and pursue oil companies to look after motorists interests
1861927 i filled up on saturday in parramatta and it was 1 36 compared with anything ive seen around it was cheap as chips i travel everywhere and it is much cheaper to fill up further away from the city in campbelltown and places like that it is much cheaper
1861928 somebody connected to this group saw madeleine and took a photograph of her the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and madeleine was taken
1861929 she had a dark look but i dont think she had dark brown eyes i think they were green brown what caught my attention was the fact that she showed little or no emotion
1861930 then the little girl stood before me and asked me in english do you know where my mummy is i answered that her mother was a little bit further back in the shop and she answered she is not my mummy
1861931 i asked her who the woman was and she said she is a stranger she took me from my mummy i noticed the little girl spoke good english without an accent
1861932 next i asked the little girl what her name was and she said my name is maggie at least thats what i thought she said when i repeated it the little girl said no my name is maddie
1861933 he did not look like a nice person that stood out i think he spoke portuguese
1861934 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
1861935 we didnt want to run the risk of having this bear run around the neighbourhood especially after what had happened
1861936 it was growling at first but then when it was coming closer to me it wasnt
1861937 i kicked it in the face because it started getting really close to me
1861938 he has meant so much not only to colorado springs but to the baseball world all over the country
1861939 hes probably more recognized in other markets than he is here because of the work hes done the guy is a historian of the game hes an ambassador for the game of baseball not just at the minor league level but at the major league level
1861940 hes dealing with the ownerships of each team to find right fits for the teams and the communities minor league baseball has grown drastically over the last 10 15 20 years because of men like branch rickey
1861941 find simple solutions to overlooked problems that actually need to be solved and deliver them as informally as possible starting with a very crude version 1 then iterating rapidly
1861942 with all its faults the american political system is the freest and most democratic in the world

1861944 which being used to provide funds for projects by helping our country to be the richest country in the world
1861945 this is fairly reflective of the nations actual state and the governments short and long term plans and programs that focus on food and energy self sufficiency and self reliance
1861946 its not about what our country can do for us it is about what we can do for our country
1861947 let us help our president to overcome the perfect storm
1861948 oh way too difficult they will never make it to the top

1861958 oh since its all different this person must be my forever
1861959 yo ahora voy a renovar el carnet la verdad que estoy entusiasmado
1861960 yo espero que a ortega y a independiente le vayan bien pese a que no soy azul
1861961 todos sabemos que no se logra nada sin esfuerzo trabajo y una constancia durante 38 fechas que es lo que dura el campeonato ac todos saben que con los nombres solamente no se pueden lograr las cosas
1861962 vamos a encontrarnos con el ser humano y con el jugador
1861963 ariel ortega tiene voluntad lo demuestra en el campo de juego es un tipo aguerrido que va al frente tiene tenacidad si esas condiciones las tiene adentro del campo de juego como no las va a tener afuera
1861964 independiente tiene una cantidad importante de sponsors y la venida de ortega seguramente le dar a independiente una cantidad m s que importante de socios
1861965 y finalmente me compromet a darle jerarqu a al f tbol de mendoza y fundamentalmente a mi club que es independiente rivadavia
1861966 yo creo que la contrataci n de ortega apunta a volver a llevar a independiente adonde tiene que estar en los primeros planos del f tbol nacional y qui n dice que alg n d a no podamos estar en los primeros planos del f tbol internacional
1861967 pero para eso hay que darle mucho trabajo a las cosas mucho tiempo en el caso de ortega es un ejemplo yo hace un a o que vengo hablando con l pero ello no trascendi en ning n medio en ning n lado nadie lo sab a por ah el trabajo silencioso cuesta lleva tiempo es sacrificado pero cuando da resultados es magn fico
1861968 si jug ramos de local en la cancha de independiente no podr amos tener habilitada las tribunas este ni norte con lo cual la capacidad del estadio estar a muy limitada m s all de ortega
1861969 considerable community interest in bright becoming an official cittaslow a
1861970 i have your letter of september 29 asking for further documentation regarding a statement made in my book the truth about water fluoridation to the effect that the idea of water fluoridation was brought to england from russia by the russian communist kreminoff
1861971 repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual s power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotizing a certain area of the brain thus making him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him a convenient light lobotomy
1861972 the real reason behind water fluoridation is not to benefit children
1861973 when the nazis under hitler decided to go into poland both the german general staff and the russian general staff exchanged scientific and military ideas plans and personnel and the scheme of mass control through water medication was seized upon by the russian communists because it fitted ideally into their plan to communize the world
1861974 i was told of this entire scheme by a german chemist who was an official of the great ig farben chemical industries and was also prominent in the nazi movement at the time i say this with all the earnestness and sincerity of a scientist who has spent nearly 20 years research into the chemistry biochemistry physiology and pathology of fluorine any person who drinks artificially fluorinated water for a period of one year or more will never again be the same person mentally or physically
1861975 it appears that the citizens of massachusetts are among the next on the agenda of the water poisoners
1861976 there is a sinister network of subversive agents godless intellectual parasites working in our country today whose ramifications grow more extensive more successful and more alarming each new year and whose true objective is to demoralize paralyze and destroy our great republic from within if they can according to their plan for their own possession
1861977 the tragic success they have already attained in their long siege to destroy the moral fiber of american life is now one of their most potent footholds towards their own ultimate victory over us
1861978 fluoridation of our community water systems can well become their most subtle weapon for our sure physical and mental deterioration
1861979 as a research chemist of established standing i built within the past 22 years 3 american chemical plants and licensed 6 of my 53 patents
1861980 even in small quantities sodium fluoride is a deadly poison to which no effective antidote has been found
1861981 careful bonafide laboratory experimentation by conscientious patriotic research chemists and actual medical experience have both revealed that instead of preserving or promoting
1861982 no wonder hitler and stalin fully believed and agreed from 1939 to 1941 that quoting from both lenin s last will and hitler s mein kampf
1861983 are our civil defense organizations and agencies awake to the perils of water poisoning by fluoridation
1861984 fluoridation of water systems can be slow national suicide or quick national liquidation it is criminal insanity treason
1861985 lord it is well that we are here if you wish i will make three booths here one for you and one for moses and one for elijah

1861994 has told us for seven years that iraq is the front line in the war on terror
1861995 the u s military the presidential administration and our nation as a whole are officially more afraid of american gays than of middle east terrorists
1861996 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
1861997 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
1861998 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1861999 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
1862000 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
1862001 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
1862002 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
1862003 pakistani military leaders rubbished the american information and evidence on the kabul bombing but provided some rationale for keeping a window open with haqqani just as the british government had decided to open talks with some taliban leaders in southern afghanistan last year
1862004 what are you going to do when you grow up
1862005 please send us a miracle so i know that there is meaning
1862006 how do you know if you are really in love
1862007 its hard to decipher between what everyone says is right what you think is right and what your heart tells you to do the hardest thing is to tell the one you love no its even harder to give them a reason more so if the reason is something they will try to convince you is not true

1862010 the goal of the organization is to have a competent and professional group of armed volunteers ready to respond to a threat at a moments notice in any area where jews reside
1862011 we do not carry out demonstrations or political activity of any kind as we have no political agenda our agenda is to protect jews wherever and whenever necessary and by any means needed
1862012 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1862013 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1862014 there can never be an excuse for helping put dangerous drugs onto our streets
1862015 when public employees are a part of the problem and when public medical benefits are used to make the scheme work these are shameful events they are also crimes
1862016 what you do to the least of these you do to me
1862017 even though we are out of words or conversation our silence is more than enough
1862018 ive suffered a lot of anxiety when i get lost driving for years it could send me into a panic attack yet i learned to play a game with myself when this happens now when i get lost i tell myself im on a grand adventure in a place ive never been and that helps me release my fears and actually have fun i see the strange environment as if im in a new land which makes me curious and i immediately feel better
1862019 it kills you its a shock someone who you greatly respect whom you hold in esteem suddenly turns into someone else

1862036 the most alarming finding is the steep decline of the oil supply after peak
1862037 since crude oil is the most important energy carrier at a global scale and since all kinds of transport rely heavily on oil the future oil availability is of paramount importance as it entails completely different actions by politics business and individuals
1862038 the battle is over the oil peakists have won current us energy policy and the administrations oil strategy in iraq and iran are deluded
1862039 the message by the iea namely that business as usual will also be possible in future sends a diffusing signal to the markets and blocks investments in already available renewable energy technologies
1862040 the oil boom is over and will not return all of us must get used to a different lifestyle
1862041 talking to bp they are finding new oil reserves in the gulf of mexico
1862042 people should be encouraged to buy local produce and to recognise that we all need to change the way we live our lives but by doing so we will actually be eating more healthily and not just in a more environmentally friendly way
1862043 if forest row cant make a transition town no where can

1862045 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
1862046 oh look youve got food on your clothes where are your clean ones

1862048 girl you are crazy for thinking you will be able to find the necklace here since we only have one in stock

1862051 they her mortgage company asked me to come up with 10 000 and i dont have it
1862052 i wrote letters to them but they already started foreclosure proceedings
1862053 she puts in a tremendous number of shifts just to make the payments on her house but it is just too much
1862054 veronica works very hard and has lived in this home for a long time
1862055 not only people losing their homes are affected the rising tide of foreclosures is driving down the value of virtually every home in minnesota this doesnt just affect jim and veronica or just north minneapolis it is affecting every area of the state and everyone who owns a house not just the people whose homes are foreclosed
1862056 what we are seeing is a downward spiral that i want to stop
1862057 he obama is going to need as many democratic u s senators as possible to make sure that his agenda gets through

1862059 we need both houses of congress working together and an administration working for us al isnt just another democrat but a dynamic energetic charismatic voice that can help rally the public will to real solutions
1862060 congress has taken an important first step in putting programs in place to help struggling borrowers in communities like this one but we need to do more
1862061 it is never too late to do the right thing
1862062 i work two jobs and i am still in school studying nursing ill just have to rent
1862063 from the bottom of my heart even if i stay here or not i am so grateful and honored

1862103 shalat raghaa ib ini adalah satu bidah yang tercela munkar dan jelek
1862104 ketahuilah setiap hadits yang menerangkan shalat di awal rajab pertengahan atau di akhir rajab semuanya tidak bisa diterima dan tidak boleh diamalkan
1862105 tidak satupun hadits yang sah tentang bulan rajab sebagaimana kata imam ibnu rajab
1862106 adapun shalat raghaaib tidak ada asalnya dari nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bahkan termasuk bidah
1862107 shalat raghaaib adalah bidah menurut kesepakatan para imam tidak pernah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menyu ruh melaksanakan shalat itu tidak pula disunnahkan oleh para khalifah sesudah beliau shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan tidak pula seorang imam pun yang menyunnahkan shalat ini seperti imam malik imam syafii imam ahmad imam abu hanifah imam ats tsaury imam al auzaiy imam laits dan selain mereka hadits hadits yang diriwayatkan tentang itu adalah dusta menurut ijma para ahli hadits demikian juga shalat malam pertama bulan rajab malam isra alfiah nishfu syaban shalat ahad senin dan shalat hari hari tertentu dalam satu pekan meskipun disebutkan oleh sebagian penulis tapi tidak diragukan lagi oleh orang yang mengerti hadits hadits tentang hal tersebut semuanya adalah hadits palsu dan tidak ada seorang imam pun yang terkemuka menyunnahkan shalat ini wallahu alam
1862108 semua hadits tentang shalat raghaaib pada malam jumat pertama di bulan rajab adalah dusta yang diada adakan atas nama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan semua hadits yang menyebutkan puasa rajab dan shalat pada beberapa malamnya semuanya adalah dusta palsu yang diada adakan
1862109 tidak ada riwayat yang sah yang menerangkan tentang keutamaan bulan rajab dan tidak pula tentang puasa khusus di bulan rajab serta tidak ada pula hadits yang shahih yang dapat dipegang sebagai hujjah tentang shalat malam khusus di bulan rajab
1862110 sesungguhnya riwayat tentang keutamaan puasa rajab semuanya adalah palsu dan lemah tidak ada asalnya dari nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
1862111 bahwa membaca kisah tentang isra dan miraj dan merayakannya pada malam tang gal dua puluh tujuh rajab adalah bidah berdzikir dan mengadakan peribadahan tertentu untuk merayakan isra dan miraj adalah bidah yang khusus dibaca pada bulan rajab dan syaban semuanya tidak ada sumber asal pengambilannya dan bidah sekiranya yang demikian itu perbuatan baik niscaya para salafush shalih sudah melaksanakannya

1862178 hey everyone i know this is extremely unexpected and disappointing to a lot you out there but laura and i have decided to end the band recently because of personal and practical reasons while this may come as a shock to many i hope i can shed some light on the reasons behind the decision first and foremost the touring lifestyle and playing on stage every night as well as making this band our entire lives and our profession had overtime become stale and anxiety ridden for both of us and in the end not enjoyable anymore we started this band because we loved playing this kind of music and loved the release that we got out of it and the satisfaction we got from jamming with our friends and taking it across the country the fact that it had not been that way for a while was enough reason for us to hang it up and leave the band as 6 years of amazing memories and amazing accomplishments there are other life goals that both her and i have that we felt would not be reached had we taken the band further say for another 5 to 10 years and we didnt want to string our other band members along in something that our hearts werent in 100 thats just not who we are and not how we ever wanted this band to be both laura and i want to get back to the root of why we love playing and writing music whether it be professionally or not and not have this burden of feeling alienated from our friends and scene because of what the touring lifestyle does to bands it is a feeling that we just couldnt handle anymore and didnt want to deal with on any level because at the end of the day music is our entire lives and we want to keep it that way we wanted to keep it enjoyable as an amazing catharsis which it was quickly becoming the opposite with all of this on top of the financial and logistical burdens we have come across in touring fulltime we felt it was the right time to make this announcement as disappointed as our friends and fans may feel we hope you understand and respect the reasoning behind this decision and can understand why wed make it while many are confused at the timing of this decision with the release of the new album and all there is more explanation to be done the new album will definitely be released within the next 4 months and it is absolutely amazing the most important thing to us right now is that all the fans we made be able to buy this album and enjoy it as a last ending high note of this bands career as we are sure you will love this album like we do we all feel it is definitely the best light this city record ever and brian jon and ryan absolutely made it something spectacular we will keep everyone updated on the release of the album and there will be news about it within the coming weeks as well as some new tracks online as for as musical futures everyone in the band is going to stay involved in music and i am sure you will hear about everyones plans in the near future we want to personally thank everyone that has ever helped this band in furthering our career in any way whether it be booking us housing us feeding us or just supporting us and coming to the shows all of our friends we have made know who they are and know how much their love and support has meant to us everyone says this but really we couldnt have done what we did without all of that support and we love every one of you because of it all of the friends we made and experiences shared have made this totally worthwhile and we dont regret a single part of it thanks to everyone and we will keep you posted on the new album

1862258 pelatih united alex ferguson mendengar argumen saya dan saya mendengar argumen dia dan kami berdua akhirnya memutuskan hal terbaik bagi kami ialah saya tetap berada di manchester united musim mendatang
1862259 ia amat gembir di sini ia selalu gembira di sini
1862260 ia tidak pernah mengeluh tentang manchester united ia selalu diperlakukan dengan wajar dan saya memiliki hubungan baik dengannya seperti halnya dengan para pemain lain

1862351 but once they get out there and they really see what they have to do and how exact they have to be and the speed at which they have to play and the intensity then i think theyll see now can we get them in and work them in yes will they get up to speed yes but this is valuable time
1862352 as far as making an impact from the get go i dont look at that as a difficult thing to do

1862394 saya mahu sertai program pas program jim program abim dan ikut tabligh keluar sebab saya sudah bosan dengan perpecahan
1862395 tentu sahaja idea itu baik dan saya menyokongnya jika anda meletakkan diri sebagai penyokong dan kekasih islam
1862396 tetapi jika anda seorang pendokong dan kekasih yang berkasih dengan islam anda harus lebih teliti rasional dan realistik
1862397 jika kita seorang pengguna ubat gigi kita bebas untuk memilih ubat gigi yang sesuai dengan keperluan kita pilih sahajalah mana mana ubat gigi yang ada di pasaran kerana semua ubat gigi itu umumnya berkongsi tujuan memutih dan menyihatkan gigi kita tetapi jika kita bekerja sebagai seorang pegawai penyelidik di sebuah kilang ubat gigi atau pegawai pemasaran malah pekerja subordinate di kilang tersebut adalah mustahil untuk syarikat kilang itu membenarkan anda pada masa yang sama bekerja di syarikat ubat gigi yang lain
1862398 aih takkan tanya kenapa pula anda akan bertindan waktu kerja anda akan bertindan strategi pemasaran anda akan bertindan pelbagai kepentingan dan siapakah yang akan anda berikan keutamaan
1862399 setiap kumpulan islam mempunyai maksud dan tujuan besar yang sama tetapi malangnya mereka berbeza jalan dan pendekatan hingga ada yang bertembung dan bertentangan ada yang mahu sampai kepada islam dengan memanfaatkan ruang di dalam demokrasi ada yang mahu sampai kepada islam dengan berperang berpatah arang dengan demokrasi itu contohnya
1862400 ada kumpulan yang menganggap penglibatan dan keprihatinannya terhadap persoalan siasah dan isu semasa sebagai suatu kelebihan manakala ada kumpulan yang menganggap pendirian non partisannya sebagai prinsip yang mesti dipertahankan maka anda boleh menghadiri program semua kumpulan ini jika kehadiran yang anda maksudkan itu adalah sebagai peserta program umum outreach dan anda hadir sebagai orang yang hanya mahu menerima bukan memberi
1862401 dan ustaz sering mengingatkan kami bahawa penglibatan kita di dalam dakwah harus untuk memberi bukan menerima betul tak
1862402 sebaik baik kamu adalah dia yang paling bermanfaat kepada manusia

1862407 this may present the greatest public health opportunity that weve had in a century

1862413 so severe and so sweeping that only urgent global action will do we are all in this together we must work together

1862417 whats changed since 2001 is the scientific certainty that this is happening
1862418 these scenes are as frightening as a science fiction movie
1862419 but they are even more terrifying because they are real
1862420 if we choose to take on this challenge it appears that we can slow the rate of change substantially giving us time to develop mechanisms so that the cost to society and the damage to ecosystems can be minimized we could alternatively close our eyes hope for the best and pay the cost when the bill comes due
1862421 we used to argue that a lot of the variability up to the late 1990s was induced by changes in the winds natural changes not obviously related to global warming
1862422 but changes in the last few years make you have to question that im much more open to the idea that we might have passed a point where its becoming essentially irreversible
1862423 natural variations could turn around and counteract the greenhouse gas forced change perhaps stabilizing the ice for a bit
1862424 eventually the natural variations would again reinforce the human driven change perhaps leading to even more rapid retreat
1862425 so i wouldnt sign any shipping contracts for the next 5 to 10 years but maybe the next 20 to 30

1862470 what is it to draw to focus so intently to catch one elusive moment with the pen it is to hush against the storm to join in with the thing drawn to ask it gently to offer up its secrets and its implicit trust in you to render true and not deceive that is why it is a work of faith and focus

1862501 apakah kamu ingin kalau muhammad menjadi penggantimu dan kamu selamat

1862504 wahai umar aku berwasiat kepadamu agar kamu takut kepada allah dalam urusan manusia dan janganlah kamu takut kepada manusia dalam urusan allah dan janganlah ucapanmu bertentangan dengan perbuatanmu karena sesungguhnya ucapan yang paling baik adalah yang sesuai dengan perbuatan wahai umar hadapkanlah wajahmu untuk orang yang allah serahkan urusannya kepadamu baik orang orang muslim yang jauh atau yang dekat cintailah mereka sebagaimana kamu mencintai dirimu dan keluargamu dan bencilah untuk mereka sesuatu yang kamu benci bagi dirimu dan keluargamu dan tundukkanlah beban menjadi kebenaran dan janganlah kamu takut celaan orang yang mencela dalam urusan allah maka umar berkata siapakah yang mampu menjalankan itu wahai said

1862513 sesungguhnya demi allah aku tidak suka untuk mengumumkan ini juga aku telah menjadikan siang hari untuk mereka dan malam hari untuk allah azza wa jalla
1862514 sesungguhnya beliau tidak keluar menemui kami satu hari dalam sebulan
1862515 aku tidak mempunyai pembantu wahai amirul muminin dan aku tidak mempunyai baju kecuali yang aku pakai ini dan aku mencucinya sekali dalam sebulan dan aku menunggunya hingga baju itu kering kemudian aku keluar menemui mereka pada sore hari
1862516 beliau sering pingsan hingga ia tidak tahu orang orang yang duduk dimajlisnya
1862517 aku telah menyaksikan pembunuhan khubaib bin adiy kala itu aku masih musyrik dan aku melihat orang orang quraisy memotong motong badannya
1862518 demi allah aku tidak ingin merasa tenang dengan istri dan anak sementara muhammad tertusuk duri dan demi allah aku tidak mengingat hari itu dan bagaimana aku tidak menolongnya kecuali aku menyangka bahwa allah tidak mengampuni aku maka akupun jatuh pingsan

1862838 woe is me if i do not preach the gospel
1862839 every evangelizer is expected to have a reverence for truth especially since the truth that he studies and communicates is none other than revealed truth and hence more than any other a sharing in the first truth which is god himself the preacher of the gospel will therefore be a person who even at the price of personal renunciation and suffering always seeks the truth that he must transmit to others he never betrays or hides truth out of a desire to please men in order to astonish or to shock nor for the sake of originality or a desire to make an impression he does not refuse truth he does not obscure revealed truth by being too idle to search for it or for the sake of his own comfort or out of fear he does not neglect to study it he serves it generously without making it serve him
1862840 the work of evangelization presupposes in the evangelizer an ever increasing love for those whom he is evangelizing that model evangelizer the apostle paul wrote these words to the thessalonians and they are a program for us all with such yearning love we chose to impart to you not only the gospel of god but our very selves so dear had you become to us i thessalonians 2 8 what is this love it is much more than that of a teacher it is the love of a father and again it is the love of a mother it is this love that the lord expects from every preacher of the gospel from every builder of the church a sign of love will be the concern to give the truth and to bring people into unity another sign of love will be a devotion to the proclamation of jesus christ without reservation or turning back

1862898 i have a lot of areas in my game of course that i need to work at
1862899 ive been playing a short period of time but theres no excuse at the professional level ive got to detail up every aspect of the game that i dont do very well and try to make it obviously nfl quality and good nfl quality
1862900 what i like about boomer so far in camp is he has a physical presence to what were doing on offense
1862901 hes really an intelligent guy for a guy that started out on the defensive side of the ball and has had as limited experience that hes had on the offensive side of the ball he brings a little bit of a physical presence there hes a big strong guy
1862902 i like what ive seen so far with him catching the ball out of the backfield even in some run situations hes proven to run the ball okay for what weve asked him to do there im very curious somebody asked this question yesterday about what im curious about seeing i cant wait to see him on special teams at some point on saturday that seems to be something that he gets excited about and im kind of anxious to watch him play it
1862903 i hold special teams close to my heart i enjoy playing special teams
1862904 i dont play special teams because i have to or i dont play special teams because im asked i mean really i dont have a choice in it anyway but when it comes down to it i desire to play special teams i enjoy covering kicks i like being out there
1862905 actually in this system obviously chemistry works good no matter what but i feel like its way more trust
1862906 i think they just need to know that when were running the ball downhill that im going to cover the guy up and that theyre going to make the move off of what i do but one thing that coach actually presses and that i think me and reagan really try to focus on is we try to cover a guy up and not tell the ball where to go we let ronnie and ricky do their thing and let them choose where to go as far as chemistry i think it really just boils down to a lot more trust they have to have faith that even in pass protection that im going to take the inside guy and theyre going to take the outside guy and vice versa
1862907 i am by no means trying to say that i am on those guys level but i try to emulate them in the way that theyre not scared to throw their face into something head first
1862908 i think thats one of the major building blocks of being an effective fullback i mean theres so much more technique that goes into it but i think the first and foremost thing that allowed me to be successful as far as sticking around is that i wasnt scared to put my face into it
1862909 footballs been the kind of thing to unify my family and thats probably been the best thing about it
1862910 take away the tv and the money and me actually getting to live my dream its the fact that its brought my family together so many more times a year and that theyve been able to kind of enjoy this roller coaster ride with me
1862911 weve kind of kept him out right now hes just got a little bit of a sore groin
1862912 so weve kept him out and were just watching him right now

1863135 bringing to justice perpetrators of crimes or attacks against the united states or its people
1863136 i just cant believe theyre going to deny a member of congress the right of reviewing how they plan to conduct the government of the united states after a significant terrorist attack
1863137 were talking about the continuity of the government of the united states of america
1863138 i would think that would be relevant to any member of congress let alone a member of the homeland security committee
1863139 maybe the people who think theres a conspiracy out there are right
1863140 i find it inexplicable and probably reflective of the usual knee jerk overextension of executive power that we see from this white house
1863141 the president can declare to the office of the presidency powers usually assumed by dictators to direct any and all government and business activities until the emergency is declared over
1863142 epa traditionally has put the highest value on life of any government agency and still does despite efforts by administrations to bring uniformity to that figure among all departments
1863143 it appears that theyre cooking the books in regards to the value of life
1863144 those decisions are literally a matter of life and death
1863145 its hard to imagine that it has other than a political motivation
1863146 its our best estimate of what consumers are willing to pay to reduce similar risks to their own lives
1863147 as people become more affluent the value of statistical lives go up as well it has to

1863150 im not part of the problem because i have my own well
1863151 you want to know whos responsible for the areas water shortage look in the mirror
1863152 if people develop a lot of wells in an area we could get into a situation where pumping water out of fractured rock could deplete or dry up a creek
1863153 lisa the whole reason we have elected officials is so we dont have to think all the time just like that rainforest scare a few years back our officials saw there was a problem and they fixed it didnt they
1863154 i realized that when it comes down to it a poor person has only one need a way to make more money
1863155 its providing a tool if thats all it was that would be good
1863156 but what martin fishers doing is hes encouraging people to start a business to be entrepreneurs
1863157 its technology and the power of marketplace that can take people out of poverty its really about the power of design and technology
1863158 for a wide door for effective service has opened to me and there are many adversaries
1863159 there has to be other ways to get her voice back are you just going to give up on her
1863160 mary the only thing she has ever loved about herself is her voice even now now that shes one of us she still thinks the same she can not see her beauty darien mary has always been that way always now the only thing she likes about herself is gone not only that from what i fear her voice
1863161 i know ive always known sense the day she came to live with us why do you think i have tried to hard to find a way to break it garith would never release it
1863162 i know there are other groups of our kind like you said larger than ours personally i never really cared until now looks like i am going to have to do some research
1863163 would you like me to go over them with you or find out on your own
1863164 a greedy and very powerful man you may be surprised hes of your culture
1863165 he no longer uses his human name we know him today as zenaku
1863166 he is surrounded by many others with power zenaku enjoys hunting for those with the potential thats the main reason why he sent garith after mary one of his followers is skilled in knowing who would make a wonderful addition to our kind i am unsure of who this person is but they saw me when i was human zenaku wanted me to join him as well he gave me a choice then i can not see why he is not giving mary a choice
1863167 ive fed would you like for me to provide for you
1863168 in your current condition you would not be able to resist any human scent you can hunt next time i promise i will not stop you but that does not mean i will not follow even if garith is no longer a threat does not mean you are free from danger
1863169 looks like kami was able to nourish you as well thats great
1863170 the bastard mary honestly darien explained to me several nights ago about his theory on you and kami even i can see it and ive never been the one to believe darien not in the mate thing anyways whats his problem youre not longer tied to garith hes denying himself what his body urns for
1863171 i can tell you know it will not be hard you could make any man you want fall for you kami will only hit the ground the hardest trust me on this mary i say do it
1863172 we will explain you have to listen you do not understand
1863173 you have to listen stay calm for a single moment please
1863174 there are thing i am still trying to figure out myself while you slept when i was not near you i took some time to study a little mary groups of our kind are what we call convents

1863176 im trying to explain hold your questions until i am finished please
1863177 mary darien ken the twins and i are a coven
1863178 we are the smallest coven we only have five members
1863179 now there are a couple other covens located all over the world all of them have at least twenty members the largest coven holds over fifty members and is the strongest
1863180 because the largest coven zenakus holds most of the power of our people they make the rules like the rule of only turning those who are willing things of that nature they were the ones who decided for you to remain mute
1863181 apparently zenaku wants it for himself a woman came to visit us the night garith died she informed us that you can stay here with us if you remain mute however if you were to find a way to get your voice back they would come for you they would take you away from us
1863182 they will come and take you away darien is not sure if we will be able to protect you from them if it happens
1863183 do not think for once that i can not take him the two of us are probably skilled in the same martial arts im not worried about zenaku
1863184 if you want your voice back fight for it and we will fight for you
1863185 there is no need to be im still trying to find more about zenakus coven when i find out more i will let you know i promise while i do this you can search for ways to get your voice back if you get it back we will prepare for the worst its your voice not theirs just like its your choice to live here if you want
1863186 tell me when you do ill be in the main library

1863206 the sdo also misbehaved with the advocate by hurling abusive words at him in front of a full courtroom this is a serious offence as the law of the land does not make any differentiation between junior and senior lawyers and mrs pandeys gesture as the judge has only amounted to the contempt of her own court
1863207 she the current sdo didt not show any sign of apology and instead tried to justify her action as the prerogative of an ias cadre under this circumstance we are no more seeking an apology from mrs pandey and instead demand her removal from siliguri at once let me clarify the siliguri lawyers are ready to take the fight to the highest possible extent and would not accept anything but the sdos transfer
1863208 i have nothing to say the people of siliguri are the best judge of what i have been doing since taking over as the sdo siliguri

1863216 theres an interaction between your genetic predisposition and the way you turn out according to the way youre raised
1863217 when it comes to being antisocial aggressive stealing and lying the interaction is a big one if you have poor self control and a rather twitchy irritable temperament and youre brought up in a harsh way its bad news for that group the rate of criminality aged 17 is about 40 per cent but if you have that twitchy character and youre brought up in a reasonably calm soothing way your parents dont overreact they let you run around in the park after school you will do well
1863218 financial poverty is a factor but not a central one
1863219 i am fond of saying poverty of what and actually it seems to be poverty of the parent child experience that leads to poor child outcomes rather than poverty of a material kind
1863220 what happened to the days when a group of kids together found things to do
1863221 in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
1863222 they have just gotta pull themselves up by the bootstraps
1863223 yeah some kids are disabled but any policy that addresses an appropriate education should make sure that the plan doesnt doesnt have any negative impact on the other kids
1863224 that teacher has 24 kids in the class and she spends half her time dealing with those two problem kids with the ieps and that leaves only half her time to deal with the other 22 normal kids including my suzie whos grades have slipped from as to bs this year because of it
1863225 the more severely disabled sit with their aides isolated from the rest of the students in the classroom and in the cafeteria my child wonders what educational benefit these students receive in the inclusion classroom
1863226 im legally entitled and everyone else will just have to suck it up
1863227 inclusion hurts the included kid by putting him in an inappropriate setting
1863228 to me comments seem a little uninspired but maybe thats because its summer

1863230 this thesis has become walsteins obsession in its drive to be the best please affluent parents and close the achievement gap on standardized tests the county is accelerating too many students in math at the expense of the curriculum and the students
1863231 thinks hes fine his parents think hes fine the school system says hes fine but hes not fine
1863232 we have the best courses and theres no achievement gap and everything is wonderful
1863233 i see this quite often kids who are so drilled at the skills they need in college skills that do not apply in the real world
1863234 and that goes for having the practical skills of fixing cars or carpentry or whatever

1863280 this is our way of showing our support for barry
1863281 from the first time i saw him on televison i knew barry was ambitious
1863282 when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out

1863287 looking back im not sure lolo ever fully understood what my mother was going through why the things he was working so hard to provide for her seemed only to increase the distance between them he landed a job in the government relations department of an american oil company sometimes i would overhear him and my mother arguing in their bedroom usually about her refusal to attend his company dinner parties where american businessmen from texas and louisiana would slap lolos back and boast about the palms they had greased to obtain the new offshore drilling rights while their wives complained to my mother about the quality of indonesian help he would ask her how it would look for him to go alone and remind her that these were her own people and my mothers voice would rise to almost a shout
1863288 if anyone no matter who were given the opportunity of choosing from amongst all the nations in the world the set of beliefs which he thought best he would inevitably after careful considerations of their relative merits choose that of his own country

1863291 lets continue propagating our needs desires policies onto the rest of the world and be damned the cost
1863292 i am a volunteer for the obama campaign in singapore and have lived in southeast asia for ten years now i dont agree with your politics but i have a healthy appreciation for any american who speaks more than one language so i subscribe to your blog and read your posts
1863293 why should obama be held accountable for his religious upbringing as a child
1863294 they the taliban might be implementing islamic law an islamic state but they completely waste their time because they do it in a totally un islamic way
1863295 i ask him to bring a new spirit of urgency to the fight against the zeus of iran and his attempt to kidnap our freedoms and by doing so to show new labours commitment to the true spirit of europe not just to an economic community or to monetary union but to european civilization itself
1863296 if the british could not stand up to islam in their colonies what makes you think they can do it today
1863297 the only nuclear legislation that ive passed i just did that last year
1863298 in stark contrast to you own statements i say obama must be elected
1863299 more than 131 billion would be redistributed from the top 1 percent of taxpayers to all other taxpayers
1863300 it is at this point a cautious estimate to say that in 2009 under obamas plan 1 13 million americans would pay more in all federal taxes than 128 million of their fellow citizens combined
1863301 with billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces
1863302 it must be a priority of american foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food shelter and clean drinking water as we strive to rebuild americas standing in the world this important bill will demonstrate our promise and commitment to those in the developing world our commitment to the global economy must extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing corporate profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere i commend chairman biden and ranking member lugar for supporting this bill and moving it forward quickly
1863303 that for some years had a reasonably muslim upbringing under the auspices of his indonesian step father
1863304 barry yang punya wajah lucu sering dimainkan teman teman pernah dipakaikan sarong meski tak pernah ikut solat
1863305 i as a black muslim in the us find it disgusting that they are trying to dig this up about him even if he went to a mosque and prayed five times a day fasted ramadan and all the other things involved that does not disqualify him as a good american and certainly not as president
1863306 to top it off he says he wasnt isnt muslim leave him alone
1863307 yes i was born a muslim and practiced islam in my childhood but later converted to christianity
1863308 that being said even if he is not being completely forthright about how islamic his upbringing was or wasnt can you blame him
1863309 ok so what if he was a muslim whats the big deal
1863310 yes i was born a muslim and practiced islam in my childhood
1863311 this childhood non issue should not be a basis of whether or not you would vote for him there are other much more important issues to consider
1863312 al qaeda will trumpet it as the greatest victory theyve ever had and that will have implications in our region because of the link between al qaeda and ji jemaah islamiyah

1863314 would negotiate without condition with the most vile terrorist leaders in the world
1863315 our modern western definition of humanity is clearly not working very well there is something about western modernity which really does eat away at the soul
1863316 the west reveals here a hatred of itself which is strange and can be only considered pathological the west is laudably trying to open itself full of understanding to external values but it no longer loves itself in its own history it now sees only what is deplorable and destructive while it is no longer able to perceive what is great and pure
1863317 only when their money and power are gone will the younger among them begin to grasp what century they are living in
1863318 i find it hard to believe that this generation will be able to muster the courage to fight for the sort of imperfect humanity which is willing to abort innocent lives while sanctifying those of criminals or which undermines its own principles by banning moral absolutes as politically incorrect
1863319 the intellectuals who hope to see england islamicized will be disappointed the gentleness the hypocrisy the thoughtlessness the reverence for law and the hatred of uniforms will remain along with the suet puddings and the misty skies it needs some very great disaster such as prolonged subjugation by a foreign enemy to destroy a national culture
1863320 many of you think that singapore is a card carrying member of the
1863321 jihadists are not going to be wished away rule of lawed into submission or democratized out of existence if you really want democracy and the rule of law in places like pakistan you need to kill the jihadists first or theyll kill you just like today they killed benazir bhutto
1863322 its so nice to see an american who takes the time to learn our culture and language

1863324 if anyone is still puzzled about the facts in fact i have never been a muslim we had to send cnn to look at the school that i attended in indonesia where kids were wearing short pants and listening to ipods to indicate that this was not a madrassa but was a secular school in indonesia

1863327 be more concerned with your character than your reputation because your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are
1863328 americas reputation standing and influence are at all time lows and possibly sinking further
1863329 america should be a smarter power by investing once again in the global good and providing things that people and governments in all quarters of the world want but cannot attain in the absence of american leadership
1863330 from the very beginning the american dream meant proving to all mankind that freedom justice human rights and democracy were no utopia but were rather the most realistic policy there is and the most likely to improve the fate of each and every person
1863331 what lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us
1863332 whereas the truth is that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager the worst
1863333 go out and immediately restore americas standing go out and tell people america was open for business and cooperation again

1863336 a lot of the new drivers cant make ends meet they usually find out in the first week or two id say about 50 percent get out of the business right away a few years back almost no one bailed that quickly
1863337 i think this is just going to become a lot more of a transient business
1863338 for some frustrated cabbies high gas prices and worsening tips are final straw
1863339 if we eliminated one third of the cabs on the road we could get by without a meter increase
1863340 the cab business has gotten bad because they relaxed the requirements and let all these new drivers in

1863391 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1863392 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
1863393 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1863394 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
1863395 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours
1863396 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements

1863413 traditionally people who are blind or visually impaired learn to rely on their hearing and tactile cues to provide them with information about their environment which they can use to navigate safely across streets and through other vehicular ways such as parking lots in so doing the sound of traffic is their primary focus traffic sounds provide information about such things as the position of vehicles their direction of travel their rate of acceleration and the speed at which they are likely to move with this information the pedestrian can make informed decisions about when to cross a street or other vehicular way safely
1863414 imagine you are a blind person traveling independently with the aid of your cane something you have done confidently for years you are crossing a fairly busy intersection you listen for sounds of approaching cars all cars seem stopped suddenly you hear screeching brakes too late you realize a quiet nearly silent hybrid car is only a few inches from you panic takes over every sense of survival says to run but where there is no time to escape as you face this horror and possible life threatening situation
1863415 recent studies have shown that even people who are fully sighted use hearing as well as vision to make street crossing decisions though they may not realize it and we havent even mentioned children and older people

1863473 my co founder eran egozy and i were both very motivated by an important problem in the world that needed solving making music is one of the most genuinely profoundly blissful experiences that life has to offer and almost no one ever really gets to have access to that experience just about everybody tries to learn to play an instrument at some point in their lives and almost all those people quit after a few months or years because its just too hard people dont have the time or talent or patience to slug it out and have these frustrating unpleasant experiences for years before they really get to have the reward so we started harmonix to invent new ways for people to have access to that very special pleasure that comes from music making

1863578 our experience has shown us that these crimes have far reaching consequences on our community
1863579 this time is going to be different this time im gonna do it im gonna stick with it nothing can stop me now
1863580 if you talk to me about wanting a man whos successful
1863581 okay but still new therefor bad until i get used to the fact that they are in my drawer
1863582 insert tool through the only spot on the truck that you can reach a special pipe thingy and slot the tool into there turn tool to lower spare tire until you can slide spare out then turn tire on side and take the holder sideways and through the center of spare tire viola one spare tire ready to use
1863583 pardon you mean help me put on the lugnuts ive got everything else done
1863584 okay now and next time i could call on my boyfriend instead of trying to do it myself
1863585 we made them a pretty generous offer on the trade so they gain some things
1863586 they have a pretty good team right now so theyre feeling confident in what they can do they just won the superliga and were happy to add pat to our team im not going to ask why im just going to be happy about the trade
1863587 to be honest columbus was one of the first ones that i heard about going to
1863588 then you set your sights on being there and what other clubs are in the mix then columbus died off for a while i thought it wouldnt happen
1863589 theyre right behind new england as a conference foe and right on their tail you almost wouldnt expect them to trade me to a team thats doing well and winning games then i heard a couple of days ago it was columbus and i was surprised and excited i look forward to joining a team thats been successful this year and has a lot of new faces sigi is doing a great job with the team hes an established coach
1863590 that doesnt suit my style of play all that well that and not playing i didnt play the first month and a half of the season in terms of starting i came in as a sub most of the games
1863591 i didnt agree with the coaching obviously they paid me a lot of money to come over here and help a team that was struggling and i didnt understand why i wasnt playing i couldnt trust the coach and not much had changed after the month and a half i had a little injury but coming back from the injury i still wasnt starting i thought it was best if i joined a team that was looking to have me as a starter and played the ball a little bit more on the ground
1863592 at this point hes probably more inclined to play wide midfield for us while robbie and ekpo are gone
1863593 he can play alejandros position in a pinch he can play guillermos position and he can certainly play both flank positions he helps us with his versatility and at the end of the day its going to be competition and whos playing best will be out there
1863594 the nice thing with pat in this transfer window is he doesnt need a work permit so we dont have to wait on that
1863595 its a matter of the federation receiving his international transfer which is on its way and then hell be cleared to play for us
1863596 im in ok shape thats probably where i need the most work is getting my fitness back the only way to do that is to play matches
1863597 in the past three weeks ive played one match of 90 minutes and came on as a sub for two for about 30 minutes hopefully within a couple of weeks i can get back to 100 percent
1863598 he was on good teams in new england and his contribution speaks for itself in terms of goals and assists all star games and national team call ups
1863599 noonan plays a number of different positions and he comes to us at a good age he still has a lot of good soccer left him

1863702 the key i think is not to spend through things that are in your face like instant messaging worms or email worms gets the antivirus companies attention real quick

1863704 their trick is not in getting that initial infection their trick is being patient and waiting for the right person to log into that workstation and then taking over that whole network

1863712 the olympic brand is extremely strong because of one overriding factor the people of the world want to find a place where there is unity
1863713 tell them that whatever they have seen and heard the games will be very well organized
1863714 tell them that we will rebound from this current crisis
1863715 the venues of the games are not a place for proactive political or religious expression
1863716 sanctions and penalties will be applied in any cases considered to be a breach of ioc policy
1863717 the belgian olympic committee announced that it will not permit its athletes to make political statements verbally or sartorially that must mean tibetan armbands in olympic venues the british olympic association similarly muzzled its athletes who will be expelled from the team if they talk about political issues anywhere at all
1863718 given chinas mighty economic power nobody really wants to antagonize beijing
1863719 we believe the olympic games are not the place for demonstrations and we hope that all people attending the games recognize the importance of this
1863720 it appears that most sponsors have made the decision to refrain from criticizing beijing rather than risk angering the chinese government
1863721 no other dictatorship has ever had more power in the united states
1863722 it would be a deadly insult and humiliation to an insecure government that would not forgive or forget
1863723 without security guarantees there cannot be a successful olympic games and without security guarantees the national image will be lost

1863738 we know that we have our work cut out for us though several of the transition teams have gained considerable speed during the season and those of us in the top four are still fighting for every point i think the meijer indy 300 will be a competitive race and great for the fans
1863739 i know it is different from being in an indycar but i am sure my experiences from last year will help me in the race
1863740 kentucky is a tough track to master because its very bumpy and very fast there is hardly any banking so its always a challenge to make sure we get the right setup on the team penske car the racing is extremely tight with a lot of side by side action which makes for an exciting show for the fans it seems that the race always comes down to the final laps and im not expecting anything different this year historically this hasnt been one of my stronger tracks but its my goal to turn that around this year

1864026 it is regrettable that the iaea allowed itself to be bullied by the u s to change its own rules to accommodate americas parochial concerns favouring india
1864027 earlier the iaea rewrote its own rules under american pressure to punish iran which had not violated its commitments under the npt or the iaea charter
1864028 we have never seen india using a with us or against us approach before
1864029 indias traditional style of diplomacy is based on invoking principles and rational arguments of a non discriminatory and universal kind
1864030 india is leveraging its bilateral relations in a crude fashion warning countries of unpleasant consequences if they dont support india an emerging economic giant and a major military power that is also an ally of the u s
1864031 that is a sad comment on the role india is playing to promote its narrow military interests and its strategic alliance with the united states and to preserve and expand its arsenal of mass destruction weapons
1864032 if the nsg grants its approval to the deal subverting its own rules that would only show that the worlds elites have no compunctions in capitulating to crass coercive diplomacy in violation of the principles and policies they advocate even if that works against the interests of global security and peace

1864090 people want to receive their health care close to where they live or work

1864092 if men today in midlife were taught anything about women when they were boys
1864093 it probably was not accurate or its been proven wrong
1864094 its not women in their fifties and sixties coming in complaining of having no interest in sex
1864095 its the ones in their thirties and forties who say theyre too busy
1864096 for one thing pregnancy is only nine months and as time goes on from delivery the hormones revert to normal
1864097 but at midlife when the natural hormonal milieu starts changing of its own accord because a womans body is shutting down its reproductive capacity it drastically affects just about every organ system in her body

1864150 dari dulu kita memperjuangkan tengkulak dihapus kalau dilegalkan sama saja dengan melegalkan penjajahan

1864152 selama ini tidak ada lembaga yang bisa menggantikan tengkulak yang tidak birokratis sehingga kita harus merangkulnya
1864153 perlu ada penelitian ke daerah daerah apakah benar tengkulak menguntungkan nelayan yang jelas di banten nelayan dirugikan tengkulak

1864160 if we would lead outside our borders if we would help those who need our assistance if we would meet our responsibilities to mankind we must first all of us demolish the borders which history has erected between men within our own nations barriers of race and religion social class and ignorance

1864162 indeed we belong to allah and indeed to him we will return
1864163 how wonderful is the case of a believer there is good for him in everything and this applies only to a believer if prosperity attends him he expresses gratitude to allah and that is good for him and if adversity befalls him he endures it patiently and that is good for him
1864164 he whom allah intends good he makes him to suffer from some affliction
1864165 a strong believer is better and dearer to allah than a weak one and both are good
1864166 isnt it obvious that god talk without god acts is outrageous nonsense
1864167 it means that my heart has to pump harder than it should to get blood to all the parts of my body this raises my chances for a stroke and heart and kidney problems
1864168 does that mean you could have a stroke heart attack or kidney failure
1864169 yes but if i lower my pressure i will lower my chances you should ask about your blood pressure too
1864170 that is a good idea i will go and get my pressure checked
1864171 i feel better knowing that you can lower your blood pressure
1864172 first i need to lose weight here is what i need to do eat less fat and calories this is a good first step cut back on foods high in sugar like soda and candy eat smaller amounts of foods at meals and eat fewer snacks during the day my blood pressure will probably go down when i lose weight
1864173 next i need to be more active being more active also will help me to lose weight and help my blood pressure go down
1864174 these are things that would make me feel better too
1864175 for sure doing them with a friend will help me to do them we can start today how about taking a walk with me after dinner
1864176 i need to cut down on salt and salty foods eating less salt and sodium also can help my blood pressure go down
1864177 i know about salt but what is sodium i see it on labels all the time
1864178 sodium is a part of salt it also is a part of mixtures used to flavor and preserve foods
1864179 how can we fix good tasting foods with less salt and sodium
1864180 listen to these tips fix foods the low sodium way try to cook from scratch start with foods low in salt and sodium use herbs spices and fruit juices to season food do not add salt to your food when cooking or at the table rinse canned foods like tuna and canned vegetables to remove salty juices
1864181 some of these herbs and spices sound good tonight i will bake the chicken with some lemon juice and oregano and in the rice i will add lots of parsley instead of salt for flavor adding herbs will help us to cut back on sodium and the food will still be tasty so we wont miss the salt
1864182 fixing foods this way seems easy enough i bet we can have some pretty good meals
1864183 this recipe for hot n spicy seasoning also sounds good maybe i will try it next week
1864184 we could start packing our lunches and snacks for work it is cheaper than buying lunch and this way we get what is good for us a lot of food you eat out is high in fat calories and sodium
1864185 these meals sound like something i would like to eat
1864186 most of the foods in these meals are easy to find in the store but we will need to change some of the foods we buy
1864187 how do you know if foods are high in sodium
1864188 sometimes you can taste it and sometimes you cannot your food will have more sodium if you add salt to it also foods that you buy already made can be higher in sodium like some tv dinners
1864189 i know foods like lunch meats and cheese are salty because i get thirsty after i eat them they are also high in fat
1864190 when i shop i always try to buy the food that has the least amount of sodium i look on the label for the words sodium or salt the food may be high in sodium if these words are listed first or a couple of times
1864191 also the amount of sodium is listed on the label
1864192 foods marked no salt added low sodium or reduced sodium are good to buy
1864193 the doctor also said i need to cut back on alcohol
1864194 the most i can have is 1 or sometimes 2 drinks a day a small glass of wine one can of beer or a shot of liquor counts as one drink i really do not mind lowering my blood pressure is more important than having a beer
1864195 the doctor said i will have to take medicine everyday to help lower my pressure the medicine will work better if i lose weight eat right and be more active

1864402 again it is all about offering control if you allow them to buy mountain dew tell them that when the three cans are gone it is gone for the week
1864403 you shouldnt try to tackle healthy eating options all at once water is probably the best drink but you can have flavored waters and you can still buy soda pop just limit it
1864404 many are now made with whole grain and are fortified with vitamins they are a pretty good snack especially with milk
1864405 if weight control is important use low fat sour cream or yogurt
1864406 i also like chex mix any kind and puppy chow
1864407 im always hungry when we are hiking this is easy
1864408 hummus is perfect a healthy dip you can use pita chips or those new very thin pretzel chips to dip in it as well
1864409 again if weight is an issue make it low fat
1864410 my one son wanted a quesadilla maker i thought it was faddy but he loves it and uses it all the time my other son is 15 and wants to bulk up so he makes ice cream drinks in a machine called the magic bullet it makes quick drinks but you could use a blender to make them
1864411 if you just want a simple number it is 2 800 calories for teen boys and 2 000 calories for teen girls
1864412 i also like having things in the freezer that they can pull out and pop in the microwave i keep miniature stuffed meatloaf in the freezer things like that
1864413 track your own eating habits the secret to healthy eating is having healthy family eating patterns
1864414 hey there i havent seen you in well pause for dramatic effect never
1864415 a few days ago a man called me and was concerned because i had forecast a move in the dow to 9 000 and the market was rising i reminded him i had turned bullish on july 15th he didnt know that because he had apparently let his subscription lapse once a call has changed from bearish to bullish it then invalidates all projections made when i was bearish when i get a sell signal then all my earlier projections will be back in force
1864416 why am i currently bullish because i follow the market the market on july 15 demanded that all market followers turn bullish we had 1 304 new stock lows that was the highest number of new lows in market history that alone demanded that all shorts with the exception of the oils be covered but on that day we also saw a clx downside non confirmation the dow falling on a rising clx
1864417 the net number of on balance volume up and down designations
1864418 at the start of all important advances or declines there is always disbelief
1864419 how far could this rally carry my first guess could take it up 800 points but my most recent research is taking aim at the 12 000 dow area i had said to do some buying in the airlines banks brokers and casinos but keep shorting the oils
1864420 this past week oil broke key supports and now looks headed for the 121 level only a few days ago the wall street journal said the consensus was looking for 200 a barrel typically wrongly timed i think anything under 121 projects to 100
1864421 not to make waves with these people and to do what i was asked
1864422 i was told that i could call the 800 hot line if i wanted
1864423 however i was reminded that gs 13 positions were coming open and that if i wanted to be promoted i should not report the fraud outside the agency i did not call the hot line
1864424 my understanding was that when contractors complain about any particular auditor bad things happen to that auditor
1864425 when i was there i always had to keep in mind how i interacted with the contractor because if the contractor complained about me it would definitely get back to my supervisor and there would be some sort of personnel actions or retaliation
1864426 when consumers asked for a bigger lcd screen we listened and created a camera that not only takes great pictures but is extremely fun to use as well
1864427 we are eager to see the response to the integration of the new capabilities for coolpix cameras as the demands of our consumers are always a priority in product design
1864428 the p6000 is an exciting product offering for nikons coolpix line as it not only provides expanded creative control for photo enthusiasts but also empowers them with gps functionality and my picturetown connectivity

1864431 there are a lot of hedge fund professionals who have misled the public
1864432 there are a lot of hedge fund professionals who have misled the public
1864433 this is a case example of how the board apparently found their man and the candidate was then able to negotiate a very rich agreement
1864434 he clearly is interested in not just being a co ceo but in being the ceo of the spin off
1864435 understandably he negotiated protection in the event the spin off doesnt occur which is primarily outside his decision
1864436 you have to look at the fact that this is a 22 billion division and in the last ten years this brand has lost a lot of position on a global level
1864437 designed to strongly align jhas interests with those of the shareholders
1864438 we believe sanjay will help to crystallize motorolas strategy refocus the company on profitable growth and help build a solid handset portfolio
1864439 you can handicap it all you like but the situation is tenuous at best it may not be desperate but its going to take a lot of work
1864440 its the biggest roller coaster you could ever imagine the highs are great and the lows are really low and thats basically on a weekly and daily basis
1864441 waiting for the results to come back youre biting your nails down to the skin
1864442 nobody can realize except those who have gone through it what it does to your psyche
1864443 and in erics case i think that comfortable place is back in the water
1864444 his spirits are extremely high hes way way excited this has all worked out and he can swim in the olympics
1864445 he thought it was 100 there was no way he was going to the olympics
1864446 the doctors said we can give you time for the trials but we dont think theres any way the surgery can be postponed until after the olympics
1864447 hes hanging in there he has been responding very well to the treatments
1864448 its one of those things that we can relate to each other on no father and son wants to have that but i understand a lot more now and a lot better what he has been going through
1864449 it was kind of surreal you cant believe this is happening
1864450 its one of those defining moments in my life i just have to make sure its a positive defining moment
1864451 i dont want to call it the worst day in my life right now and from some people i talk to maybe itll be the best day of my life in 10 years because itll help define me as a person
1864452 it gives you a better sense of the bigger picture
1864453 the olympics looks a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer
1864454 you almost forget he has it because he doesnt act like he has it
1864455 it stuck in his craw for four years that he just missed making the olympic team in 04 he spent four years focusing on it he didnt want to let anything interfere with that goal
1864456 ironically the swim i actually made the team in wasnt necessarily a great swim for me
1864457 to be honest it wasnt a real smart swim i know i can be a lot faster at the games
1864458 the field is very very deep the 200 breaststroke has gotten a lot faster over the past four months a lot of people have dropped a lot of time
1864459 but i give myself a better chance than most to get on that podium because i know im perfectly capable of getting up there in the top three
1864460 id be shocked if hes not in the 2 08s 2 09s at the olympics he has that in him if he swims the right race
1864461 i try to keep swimming separate from the medical stuff as much as i can i dont want to bring that stuff to the pool
1864462 at the same time swimming is how i kind of escape from it at this point swimming is kind of like a vacation for me i dont think about the cancer when im in there practicing
1864463 when you get to an event like the olympic games you can put too much pressure on yourself ive kind of got an out in cancer it keeps things in perspective for me theres a lot more to life than just the olympic games
1864464 hes an over worker he always works harder than you want more often than you want and hes doing the same thing
1864465 when he walked through the door for a swim meet or practice he has always been able to leave all that baggage outside
1864466 i have to listen to certain people but in the end as long as im happy with myself thats all that matters
1864467 you just kind of take ownership of it ok this is the card ive been dealt
1864468 if this doesnt stop right now i need to think about going to the er and getting checked out
1864469 do not be like the horse or the mule which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you
1864470 after living in chicago you start to panic when you see your kid is not where you expect them
1864471 he really believed the lessons learned in football applied to life
1864472 i was a single mom with four boys and he was very fortunate to have great male role models
1864473 they were his football coaches and he wanted to make sure kids had that
1864474 he wanted to beat you during the game but before and after he was the nicest guy
1864475 he just wanted all the kids to improve not just his he coached football the right way
1864476 having a football team was a big step for hanover
1864477 it was important to the guys and the community he created a bond with the community
1864478 i cant believe no one has said this yet so i will

1864480 he told me when i get out of here were going to have milk and cookies

1864484 we certainly believe they have a strong team here we have a strong team here as well we make no predictions about whether we will be first or second or third in the medal count
1864485 we look at this as a three country race with china leading the way
1864486 its going to be a matter of what happens every day of the games youre going to find medals coming that are surprises and youre going to have some disappointments

1864535 for the lord sees not as man sees for man looks on the outward appearance but the lord looks on the heart
1864536 meanwhile the moment we get tired in the waiting gods spirit is right alongside helping us along if we dont know how or what to pray it doesnt matter he does our praying in and for us making prayer out of our wordless sighs our aching groans he knows us far better than we know ourselves knows our pregnant condition and keeps us present before god thats why we can be so sure that every detail in our lives of love for god is worked into something good

1864556 and they overcame him the accuser of the brethren because of the blood of the lamb and because of the word of their testimony and they did not love their life even when faced with death

1864595 you grew up as claire huxtable as your mother giving you advice filling in the blanks where your mom left off
1864596 for a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin but there was always some obstacle in the way something to be gotten through first some unfinished business time still to be served a debt to be paid then life would begin at last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life

1864615 our mission is to become a hub for people who appreciate latin film as well as to showcase online some of the most compelling films produced in iberoamerica
1864616 i think thats reflective of the fact that at one time oregon had an open door for illegal aliens to get their drivers licenses from all over the united states
1864617 previously oregon had been a magnet for individuals from other states coming in and obtaining drivers licenses
1864618 i think the changes in the law have been effective
1864619 hes the one who issued an executive order and basically forced the legislature to go along with the process
1864620 only one language group declined all the others remained pretty static
1864621 that means that little by little theyre not going to do their work
1864622 peakes books are actual additions to life they give like certain rare dreams sensations we never had before and enlarge our conception of the range of possible experience
1864623 this meant looking at open source solutions instead of platforms such as microsoft or sun we chose lamp linux apache mysql and php
1864624 i started from scratch it took me countless hours doing research on programming i really pushed myself to the limit
1864625 i just got my nails done can you get the door for me

1864628 and damn it robert i will not have him go off to that lying school in providence they tell of evolution there and hold high the thoughts of absent minded people who call themselves anthropologists the place is not at all the type of school our children should

1864637 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1864638 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1864639 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1864640 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1864641 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1864642 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1864643 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1864644 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1864645 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1864646 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1864647 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1864648 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1864649 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1864650 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1864651 hope we can get three times yield four times will be better if there are five or six times more than we need to ask question

1864669 allah the almighty has named this child zainab this very name was written in the lauh e mehfooz
1864670 o messenger of allah last night i dreamed of a severe hurricane blowing over the entire earth i took shelter from the sandstorm under a gigantic tree but even that got uprooted and collapsed to the ground i then took refuge under a fallen branch of that tree but that too did not last long i sought shelter under a third branch of the same tree but it was crushed into pieces due to the severity of the wind i continued to seek refuge under two entangled branches but the hurricane simply blew them away and then i awoke with a start
1864671 zainab the tree under which you were sheltered is your grandfather who will leave this world shortly the other two branches were your parents who will also leave this transient world and the two entangled branches are your brothers hasan and husain under the trials and difficulties faced by whom the world will be enveloped in darkness
1864672 my dear child this child of mine zainab will be confronted with a thousand and one calamities and face serious hardships in karbala

1864678 the present crisis in the womens league necessitates that i step down as president and a new leader be elected at polokwane
1864679 not at all the league believes that our support for msholozi is one of the few good things weve done
1864680 the league believes that we cannot have a situation in which we are fighting for gender equality while there are some comrades who are asking for women to replace men in government and the party simply because these comrades happen to be men and we we happen to be women
1864681 it cannot go on like this much longer now only a man can clean up the mess we have made of things the nec has met and it has decided comrade vavi is that man
1864682 an important moment in the struggle for gender equality and the broader transformation of our society
1864683 send a signal to everyone that men are just as good at representing womens issues as women are if not better
1864684 the issue of women is so close to comrade vavis heart that he is likely to give this some serious thought
1864685 so surprised to see the two man merrily chatting as they came through the doors

1864707 e poi incontrai te laura e ci mettemmo a vivere insieme e adesso tu te ne sei andata ma sai fin qui non mi hai offerto niente di nuovo se vuoi avanzare nella classifica dovrai cercare di fare di meglio
1864708 i beatles sono solo miei non miei e di laura non miei e di charlie non miei e di alison ashworth e anche se mi daranno delle emozioni non saranno mai brutte emozioni
1864709 nessun problema e questa probabilmente lultima volta che ci parliamo nessuno problema ecco le ultime parole che dico a qualcuno con cui sono stato in una certa intimit prima che le nostre vite prendano strade diverse strano eh passi il natale in casa loro stai in ansia quando si operano dai loro baci ed abbracci e fiori le vedi in vestaglia e poi bum finita punto e basta addio per sempre e prima o poi ci saranno unaltra mamma un altro natale ulteriori vene varicose si assomigliano tutte cambiano solo gli indirizzi e il colore delle vestaglie
1864710 mi domando cosa direbbe laura se sapesse che nello stesso momento smanio al pensiero che marie possa venire nel mio negozio
1864711 le nostre radici sono abbastanza profonde rob non fossaltro perch stiamo insieme da tanto tempo e io non volevo mandare tutto allaria e ricominciare daccapo a meno di non esserci proprio costretta ecco perch ho tenuto duro
1864712 dicono tutte cos sempre sempre ti dicono che non centra nessun altro questa la prima legge del trauma amoroso
1864713 sapete qual la cosa peggiore nellessere mollati la mancanza di controllo se solo potessimo controllare il come e il quando veniamo scaricati non sarebbe cos brutto ma allora chiaro non s tratterebbe pi di un rifiuto dico bene sarebbe come una separazione consensuale no e io sarei libero di intraprendere la carriera del solista
1864714 appena ho visto laura fuori dal negozio ho capito assolutamente senza dubbio che la desidero ancora ma questo probabilmente dipende dal fatto che lei a rifiutare me se potessi indurla ad ammettere che c la possibilit di rimetterci insieme le cose mi sarebbero pi facili se posso andare in giro senza sentirmi ferito e impotente e infelice riesco a ritare avanti anche snza di lei in altre parole soffro perch lei non mi vuole ma se arrivo a convincermi che un po mi vuole ancora allora sar star di nuovo bene perch a quel punto sar io che non la vorr pi e potr cercarmi unaltra
1864715 sto pensando io che ho fatto il bagno con questa persona gi quasi fatico a ricordarmi com fatta
1864716 smetterei di far cos se ci riuscissi ma sembra chein questa faccenda io non abbia scelta
1864717 vorrei essere un essere umano compiuto libero da tutti questi grovigli di rabbia colpa e disgusto verso me stesso
1864718 qualsiasi cosa dicano non puoi saltare nel letto con la prima persona che ti piace e pretendere che questo non rovini il tuo matrimonio
1864719 si pensa che siano le donne a isolarsi a causa di una relazione sentimentale finiscono col vedere soprattutto gli amici del loro lui e fare soprattutto le cose che piacciono a lui e quando vengono lasciate o lasciano loro qualcuno scoprono di essersi staccate irrimediabilmente da amici che hanno visto bene per lultima volta tre o quattro anni prima
1864720 la relazione con laura mi diede un senso di appartenenza a un luogo e se perdi questo senso di appartenenza ti viene nostalgia di casa logico
1864721 sembra che sia impossibile fare le cose giuste con qualcuno quando smetti di andarci a letto puoi provarci con tutte le tue forze ma non trovi mai un modo per fare marcia indietro o per andare oltre o per girarci attorno
1864722 insomma c unaccozzaglia di roba ma impossibile non amare chi vive in questa casa perch tutto ti dice che sono persone interessanti educate gentili cos ora capisco che in fondo mi piaceva moltissimo fare parte di questa famiglia e anche se mi lamentavo sempre quando venivamo qua la domenica pomeriggio o per il finesettimana non mi ono mai annoiato nemmeno una volta
1864723 io vorrei sapere dico per modo di dire perch non lo voglio affatto sapere di cose come gli orgasmi multipli e le deci volre a notte e i giochi e le posizioni di cui non si mai sentito parlare ma non ho il coraggio di domandarle niente di tutto questo e lei non me lo direbbe mai so che lhanno fatto e questo gi abbastanza brutto sul momento posso sperare solo di limitare i danni
1864724 ma io mi dispererei sempre se mai laura se ne andasse di nuovo questo quello che ho imparato per cui dovrei essere felice che sia tornata no cos dovrebbero andare le cose giusto ed cos che vanno pi o meno quando non ci sto troppo a pensare

1864729 for two centuries pilgrims progress was the best read book after the bible in all christendom but sadly it is not so today when i ask my classes of young and youngish evangelicals as i often do who has read pilgrims progress not a quarter of the hands go up yet our rapport with fantasy writing plus our lack of grip on the searching humbling edifying truths about spiritual life that the puritans understood so well surely mean that the time is ripe for us to dust off pilgrims progress and start reading it again certainly it would be great gain for modern christians if bunyans masterpiece came back into its own in our day have you yourself i wonder read it yet
1864730 next to the bible john bunyans pilgrims progress is the best selling christian book of all time at its first appearance part one 1678 part two 1684 it was an instant hit and it has never been out of print there have been literally hundreds of editions and dozens of translations by common consent it is bunyans masterpiece and a milestone in english literature both sacred and secular

1864755 i work in pittsburgh and will have to be late for work every day
1864756 its good for the citizens the municipality and the police department
1864757 were suggesting its in everyones best interest to get pat back to work expeditiously the city is paying him and he ought to be working
1864758 the idea here is to get a decent public servant back to serving the public
1864759 weve waited this long to pass judgment and until i hear back officially from the commission well reserve judgment
1864760 but i will say its in everybodys best interest to try to bring this issue to closure and if mr fishers statements yesterday were accurate the ethics board will communicate that to us in the very near future and then the ura board will make a decision obviously with input from myself as well
1864761 has received assurances from authorities that his cooperation with them is of mutual interest
1864762 there were so many people lying on the ground covering the street even among those who were barely walking some had burned clothes on most were naked there were also those whose eyes had been blown out of their sockets by the bomb blast
1864763 the rivers running through the city were also filled with corpses many of them were those who had jumped into the river to escape from the fire or to cool down their burns only to drown
1864764 what were trying to do is make a strong statement that we remember the devastation and what we want is a world of peace
1864765 the idea is to show graphically and make people think about the black rain that fell in hiroshima and nagasaki after the bombings
1864766 we want to draw attention to peace and the abolition of not exclusively nuclear warfare but to war in general
1864767 its like youre in paradise the music water food and drink camaraderie and beach like ambiance
1864768 i love to boogie woogie to the old time music
1864769 its nice being outside and i love the festive atmosphere

1864771 as a single parent i have to watch my finances i buy an annual pass and all this is included
1864772 there was no evidence in general no evidence of excessive force being used
1864773 i cant get down to the specifics of what we did or did not find in the autopsy
1864774 its more of like a passive investigation where well gather police reports and newspaper accounts we will be monitoring the county investigation
1864775 in a progressive society the people cannot allow overzealous poorly trained police officers to commit murder against innocent citizens
1864776 we demand that the officers involved in the death of andre thomas be relieved of duty until a complete investigation has been conducted
1864777 no comment regarding this case will come from this council due to the fact that the incident you are referring to is under investigation by the county police and district attorneys office
1864778 pittsburghs a distressed city and were giving away our prime riverfront property
1864779 we discussed with him very clearly that at north hills if one of our staff members were to partake in any of the offerings at canyon it would not be recognized at north hills
1864780 we dont see the affiliation being necessarily relevant here at north hills
1864781 maybe there was some misinformation brought to us by them
1864782 if someone is taking course work to get a degree they need to do their homework to ensure it is an accredited legitimate degree granting institution otherwise they may end up spending money and doing work for what ultimately could be a meaningless degree
1864783 i dont know anything about canyon college and quite honestly i dont really care what im looking for is somebody who can shoot the lights out for the north hills school district
1864784 we hired a guy to do a job as an administrator based on the feedback that weve received from the people who know him best in his previous district weve received rave reviews
1864785 based upon what i know now i would need to reconnect and re evaluate the situation with canyon college
1864786 i have a commitment to the staff at west middlesex
1864787 we just were trying to do something that was good for the district
1864788 i had all the right intentions in mind and that is to help educators become better educators
1864789 theres no legal basis for the claim this is a legitimate degree
1864790 the entity itself has no legal authority to issue degrees it would be like saying i did a bunch of course work for wal mart and they gave me a degree
1864791 said mark browning spokesman for the idaho state board of education
1864792 the taxpayers deserve a little bit more for their money
1864793 but we are hoping to have an agreement in place by late fall
1864794 its a substantial investment and it only makes sense that we would want to reach as many customers as possible with our new services
1864795 we will be negotiating with them to determine where they start
1864796 in the future we will look to see what we can do to expand offerings
1864797 we think we are very competitive and when you get competition consumers win
1864798 we knew this was coming and were going to compete for every inch of the territory
1864799 i deeply appreciate georges willingness to remain with our company until his successor comes on board as well as to continue on a part time basis for six months thereafter to ensure a smooth transition
1864800 george has made many contributions to questcor and played a key role in supporting the rapid turnaround and growth of the company we appreciate georges efforts in the transition process and wish him the best as he pursues other interests
1864801 the entire questcor team has been extremely supportive of my decision to seek new career opportunities closer to my home and family in san diego
1864802 i look forward to working with don and my successor during the transition process and remain very excited about the future and potential of questcor
1864803 were seeing more people not only sicker people but more of them
1864804 this is not something that this group is prepared to offer at this point
1864805 we want to take a thoughtful approach without feeling that were pressed to act with some sense of urgency
1864806 we feel like a lot of this we received in the 11th hour and were asked to put forth enabling legislation we owe it to our constituents to make sure that whether its the municipal government or city residents theyre actually informed
1864807 do we need two economic development agencies do we need all of these different planning authorities
1864808 i think that clearly around the table here there are a wide range of views beyond that one expressed and recommended in the nordenberg report
1864809 believes a full consolidation of city and county government is the best choice for residents
1864810 the legislative accomplishments and unabashed energy that rep deweese has brought to harrisburg for over three decades cannot be questioned as well as his leadership in enacting important legislative reform laws that have changed how the house operates
1864811 although bill deweese has not been charged with any crime and has fully cooperated with the attorney general in the investigation a systematic inexcusable and indefensible violation of the public trust occurred on his watch
1864812 we must have had something in common because we became best buddies
1864813 it was a 4 4 1 2 hour drive home and for the first time dad was willing to open up and talk about the experience
1864814 maybe it was as if he thought until now if he didnt talk about hurtful things it wouldnt hurt
1864815 there i was in a nursing home when i got the call
1864816 people were stopping to ask about it at the airport
1864817 the losses were about equal the people we lost to weather and the people we lost to combat
1864818 the first thing i asked the guy was are my legs still there
1864819 people were coming up to my dad spontaneously asked to shake his hand and to thank him
1864820 i heard a crack and i thought it was a car backfire
1864821 i was scared the minute a co worker said there was a gunman out there
1864822 as soon as i heard the robbery report i was guessing it was related
1864823 we have a group of bank robbers out there and theyre shooting and we have to get them off the streets
1864824 this is ligonier pennsylvania a great place to live and raise a family
1864825 there were so many people involved with this somebody out there must know something
1864826 we heard loud and clear at public hearings that people didnt want to see local or long distance diversions to local roads
1864827 we believe this plan favorably addresses some of the concerns
1864828 this continues to be a classical case of robbing peter to pay paul ripping the carpet out from underneath rural pennsylvania to better serve more affluent communities
1864829 we try to make it a learning experience for all the kids
1864830 its a good way for them to learn its tangible very hands on
1864831 best buddies is a great program its really rewarding and really fun
1864832 everyone gets something out of it they learn from you and you learn from them
1864833 everyone should give it a chance and get involved its not a commitment to a club its a commitment to a friend
1864834 the first thing they say when they visit is can we go downstairs
1864835 eventually you find something you dont have yet and you figure youd like to add it to your collection
1864836 it fits my fancy if its beat up really old and rusted i need to have that
1864837 this was really bad once and he took it all apart and painted the back it was hard for him to do
1864838 when we were dating i used to stop by the candy store and they had gumball machines with little trinkets and i would bring them to her and she saved them all
1864839 we dont know how cell phones will affect us down the line they are a relatively new phenomenon ive lost the battles on phone safety some of my family actually drives while talking to say nothing of the cost of a plan for three teenagers and a husband who travels
1864840 with this report i got their attention now at least for a while
1864841 this just confirms for me the concerns i already had about brain cancer said robert matzen of bethel park
1864842 now i am really careful to keep my conversations short said mr matzen 46 an independent filmmaker for paladin communications of bethel park
1864843 definitely interested in buying a hands free device for our car
1864844 shorten conversations and we are more aware of where the phone is placed
1864845 i just learned of a device that claims to negate the effects its a little disc that you put in your cell phone to eliminate the electromagnetic fields so my plan is to purchase it said mrs yehnert 55 a homemaker
1864846 refuses to let my kids get a cell phone until they are at least 16
1864847 now i carry my cell phone with the battery away from me said ms mckown 51 manager at curves in brentwood town square
1864848 i work in academic affairs at pitt and im paying attention to the report now i plan to get bluetooth and told my kids to text not call said carol tatrai 49 of west homestead
1864849 i dont like bluetooth it scares me people talking to themselves i do text message does that mean ill get finger cancer asked the 25 year old waitress at mitchells fish market at the waterfront
1864850 theres not enough data science always flip flops on what is good for you or bad for you one day eggs are good and the next day theyre bad wine is bad and then wine is good said mr folino 29 who owns folino brothers pizzeria in scott
1864851 these days someone finds something wrong with anything new ive not seen any definitive medical evidence so i wont limit use
1864852 in my business i travel and need to be in touch all the time said douglas wesolek 28 of dormont who owns west liberty detailing in that town
1864853 i cant give up this convenience remember were all going to die someday
1864854 all this just dont seem real my sons an honor roll student i give him everything i spoil him i dont see why he would need to rob anybody
1864855 from gold chains to earrings i give him everything he wants i wont have to worry about him selling drugs
1864856 he didnt seem out of the ordinary he wasnt shaky he keeps himself clean and the clothes he had on were spotless he had on a white t shirt and white sneakers
1864857 i kind of see what were doing as a grass roots movement to leverage the school board to try to get a fair curriculum
1864858 you just want to promote what you believe in and are passionate about
1864859 you want it to be better you want it to be fair
1864860 kids are not learning how to think outside the box and thats what art does if you have a good arts program in school it helps develop kids creative thinking process
1864861 it does not look as though he was struck by a vehicle
1864862 but its unknown at this point how his injuries occurred
1864863 how dare you not be home to answer the phone and hear about my first day of school amp my first day of school gift
1864864 eat the big ones and put the little ones in the pail
1864865 the ballot language of proposition 2 fails to provide protections for any workers involved in hen egg production processing or distribution which is unacceptable to the california teamsters
1864866 the proponents of proposition 2 have written a ballot initiative that is too vague in terms of who is subject to law enforcement proceedings which allows local agencies to interpret the law as they see fit it is in the best interest of our workers and their families to vote no on prop 2 and send a strong message of unity to defeat this anti worker ballot initiative
1864867 the teamsters have stepped up to protect california workers and consumers by opposing prop 2 the un safe food initiative
1864868 prop 2 is a risky and costly measure that jeopardizes food safety and public health california working families cant afford prop 2 especially at a time when californians are struggling with rising unemployment rates a deepening mortgage crisis and sky rocketing food and gas prices
1864869 jangankan anak batita di indonesia anak usia sd pun masih ada yang tidur bareng orang tuanya kok
1864870 lo kok harimaunya sudah enggak ada di kolong tempat tidur wah dia sudah kabur takut sama adek
1864871 mau enggak diladeni kasihan karena dia kan kangen dengan orang tuanya yang seharian tadi bekerja di luar rumah tapi kalau ditanggapi kok jadi keterusan aku sebenarnya senang senang saja main dengan anak tapi capeknya itu lo aku kan juga butuh istirahat
1864872 anak akan menganggapnya sebagai suatu pola yang dapat diterima dia bisa berpikir ah kalau besok aku bangun malam lagi dan minta main pasti papa mau nemenin kan asyik dengan kata lain anak akan terdorong untuk melakukan hal yang sama keesokan hari dan selanjutnya ini sebetulnya yang perlu dihindari
1864873 bila kebiasaan ini berlanjut terus maka akan sulit untuk diubah
1864874 duh malik masak sudah jam 12 malam masih main kuda kudaan sama papa memangnya papa enggak capek
1864875 di malam hari si kelinci tidur sang ayam tidur si kuda tidur dan seterusnya
1864876 sebenarnya ini sudah malam lo dek waktunya untuk tidur coba lihat di jalanan sudah enggak ada orang lewat kan
1864877 kalau malam kucing harus bobok ayam juga bobok semuanya harus bobok adek juga harus bobok
1864878 adek boleh bermain robot tapi sebentar saja ya setelah itu bobok
1864879 kalau adek enggak mau bobok ya sudah tapi ini sudah malam dan waktunya untuk bobok ayah dan bunda mau bobok duluan jadi lampunya dimatikan ya
1864880 a ndi tidur dong sayang masak enggak capek sih lompat lompatan terus
1864881 se belum dia berhasil menyelesaikan pasel misalnya anak aktif umumnya tidak akan menyerah hal ini terjadi karena anak aktif punya energi lebih banyak dan lebih tahan terhadap tantangan yang dihadapi
1864882 bila anak aktif diberikan arahan dia bisa melakukan segala sesuatu dengan baik
1864883 hiperaktif termasuk anak dengan kebutuhan khusus dan perlu penanganan serius
1864884 menurut saya lebih bagus anak banyak gerak karena dia akan mempelajari sesuatu lebih banyak sedangkan anak yang lebih sering diam selain motoriknya kurang terlatih juga banyak hal yang tidak dapat diketahui anak kepasifannya malah bisa mengganggu kreativitas anak dan inisiatifnya kelak
1864885 setiap anak memang memiliki kebutuhan tidur yang beragam mungkin kebutuhan tidur anak aktif lebih sedikit sehingga kita sering menemukan mereka sulit untuk diajak tidur
1864886 istirahat terbaik kan tidur jadi batita memang sebaiknya tidur di siang hari
1864887 mungkin saja nantinya bukan orang tua yang mengendalikan anak malah anak yang mengendalikan rutinitas hariannya juga mengendalikan orang tuanya
1864888 namun jangan sampai keterusan hingga anak lupa tidur tetapi batasi dan minta anak untuk segera tidur
1864889 suasana tenang lampu redup terkadang sangat diperlukan untuk membuat anak lebih mudah tidur
1864890 di teve kan banyak sekali hal menarik sehingga anak tertarik untuk melihatnya bila demikian sulit baginya untuk memejamkan mata
1864891 tidur siang memang sangat penting diterapkan pada anak namun bila pada kenyataannya orang tua malah mengalami kesulitan saat mengajak anak tidur di malam hari boleh saja kita mengorbankan waktu tidur siangnya
1864892 anak usia ini punya kebutuhan tidur sekitar 12 jam per hari jadi kalau tidur siangnya kelewat lama lebih dari 5 jam misalnya jangan heran jika di tengah malam buta saat kita nyenyak tidur anak justru tak lagi membutuhkan tidur
1864893 orang tua hendaknya bersikap tegas dan konsisten dalam mengajari anak tentang apa yang boleh dilakukan pada siang hari dan apa yang boleh dilakukan pada malam hari siang hari adalah waktu untuk bermain dan lain lainnya sedangkan malam hari adalah waktu untuk istirahat atau tidur
1864894 apa pun alasan anak saat terbangun tengah malam ia harus tetap berada di tempat tidur kecuali untuk buang air kecil atau besar

1864897 an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
1864898 the church has shifted its stance on several matters notably the rightness of lending money at interest and the moral admissibility of contraception so i am bound to ask if this is another such issue

1864915 the british writer was the subject of a long and critical essay in the preceding issue of the new yorker in which the great man was accused of anti semitism and his catholic religion painted with a strong dull coat of condemnation
1864916 it goes to chestertons reputation and influence that hes still being vilified even though he died in 1936 the dead only matter if they once spoke the truth and gilbert keith chesterton spoke and wrote the truth of permanent things of first things
1864917 at a time when h g wells was celebrating infidelity and george bernard shaw deconstructing marriage chesterton insisted that family was at the epicentre of any civilized society family and faith
1864918 the fight for the family and the free citizen and everything decent must now be waged by the one fighting form of christianity
1864919 the christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting it has been found difficult and left untried
1864920 in the final years of his life chesterton predicted that the absolutes of right and wrong would become blurred religion publicly condemned and that we would care more for animals than babies and would worship sex while mocking love

1864965 a missional church is a theologically formed gospel centered spirit led fellowship who seeks to faithfully incarnate the purposes of christ the mission of the church is found in the mission of god who is calling the church to passionately participate in gods redemptive mission in the world matt 28 18 20 acts 1 8
1864966 biblical evangelism emphasizes the faithful following of christ over and above an on the spot response that is to say that we are commanded to make disciples not entice decisions the emphasis is not on procuring a sinners prayer a raised hand or an altar call the emphasis is on making fully equipped disciples of christ and teaching them to obey all that christ commanded in submission to his lordship
1864967 my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work joh 4 32 34 esv a outward church actively seeks to be trained and equipped as a ambassador through its gospel community eph 4 11 16 every member is personally equipped to engage friends and neighbors with the gospel because they themselves have been impacted by the gospel gal 2 20 a outward church is deeply dependent upon the holy spirit as an agent for evangelizing the lost world acts 1 8 4 8 31 13 9 lost people are saved by the holy spirit when and how he determines a outward church commits to the authoritative infallible inerrant inspired all sufficient scriptures 2 timothy 3 14 17 acts 2 42 the authority of all ambassador work is founded in the truth that god has a clear word to communicate to the world a outward church develops relationships with the lost for the purpose of incarnating christ matt 5 13 16 it seeks to intentionally develop meaningful relationships with the numerous acquaintances in their lives a outward church uses sacrificial love as its means of witness john 15 12 17 1 john 4 19 21 every believer is constrained to practically and sincerely demonstrate extravagant love to non believers a outward church helps others to find jesus in their own way and timing without using manipulative tactics or fruitless discussions 1 cor 9 20 23 1 tim 1 3 4 it is the sovereign god who uses us as we humbly relate to others misperceptions of the gospel we are patient kind and non antagonistic as we realize that jesus christ loves them too
1864968 jesus is not a vending machine that dispenses what we want to feel good about ourselves he is the holy one who comes to cleanse us fill us and change us he does not do this according to our agendas he will not serve our wayward needs he loves us too much to merely make us happy he comes to make us holy

1864970 one of the statements that he relayed to me that his children were in fact told by fbi agents that were doing the interview that their father was a murderer
1864971 and that i could tell greatly disturbed bruce as it would anybody
1864972 the notion that somehow these people were coerced by the agents or the lawyers is categorically false
1864973 these agents handled themselves professionally with great respect for mr ivins and his family and id say the same thing about the prosecutors in the case
1864974 she was manhandled by the fbi upon their entry and not immediately shown the search warrant her apartment was wrecked while fbi agents screamed at her that i had killed five people and that her life would never be the same again she was terrified by their conduct put into isolation for interrogation for eight hours
1864975 instead it was deluged with everything but the governments press conference was an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by dr ivins
1864976 dr ivins was characterized by his commanding officer for his openness sharing humor and curiosity and was lauded for the central role he has played in the protection of the american soldier
1864977 no one who attended that service could believe that dr ivins committed any crime

1865013 today is my day to die for 37 days i have lived as i was meant to live i have overslept overspent and used up all of the free samples i had been saving for later i lived these last days without judgment and anger and my body liked this i was kind to people who seemed annoyed i laughed until i cried and cried until i could see clearly i practiced dying by giving up a little of myself every day i left my possessions where they were needed my ideas grew bigger and my ego became smaller i wore color and read whatever people i loved recommended every interaction every conversation was on purpose and intended for me if i stumbled and fell it was because i was meant to learn from the ground up if i made a mistake i learned how to do it better next time language expanded without limits yes more often than no and instead of but and this is a yes and this is a yes too words leapt from me and danced on paper i spent most of my time outside because someone was always up for a game of tag or hide and go seek i ate what tasted good if someone asked me for money i gave it if they needed to be heard i listened to them i was everybodys mirror everybodys open arms who could not see themselves in me who could not love me love themselves now on the last day of my life i am lying still in my yard just before sunset a great big tree above attends my last moments the summer sky is crying colors just for me my two year old daughter scooches closer and squeezes my hand for a moment with her tiny sticky one she is eating a ripe perfect peach with such intensity that i think the rest of the world has disappeared for her i sigh and sink into the earth death doesnt come only peace

1865154 i sensed actually that there was anger in his voice so after the program i decided to call him up and i said you know i heard that you are kind of peeved at me because you heard reports i insulted you in public
1865155 i hope you will understand that im just representing the interest of my people i want to protect their rights gusto naming mabasa yung moa and we would like to question the provisions of the moa

1865157 our leaders so that they will understand that we should not expect a lot from the armed forces because right now their government attitude is they are willing to sacrifice us just to please the milf
1865158 to us in the province of cotabato at the time of the conflict in 1999 up to 2001 he was our hero we were surprised by the dramatic transformation of jun esperon from the warrior that we knew him from the defender of the people of the province of north cotabato to his new role of being a peacemaker
1865159 he forgot that what he is saying would already affect the trust level of the people in the province of north cotabato to government
1865160 what are our options if the armed forces will not defend us according to secretary esperon we will be forced to defend ourselves what else do we do
1865161 huwag ng magkalat ng mga text upang maghanda at lumaban di ito nakakatulong sa sitwasyon mabuti ng mag usap tayo bago tayo maglabanan
1865162 we are duty bound to protect the communities from rebel atrocities and we do not renege on our mandate we would like to assure that any violation of law regardless of whatever group is perpetrating these violations your armed forces of the philippines will deal with it
1865163 its very irresponsible for a government official to even say that the government will desert us and we have to take up arms to defend ourselves there could be some drama there
1865164 was irresponsible and very unprofessional and betrays a mindset that ignores civilian rule
1865165 it will take only one man out of 20 million mindanaoans to create mayhem
1865166 looking forward to continue the discussion so that the problem could be resolved as quickly as possible
1865167 ive reminded nepali prime minister that we have been frustrated by the lack of a stable government in nepal to continue the talks
1865168 no matter where i look the inflation rate will continue to rise and might even reach 12 9 percent by october it will definitely peak by october
1865169 we should expect the double digit rate to last probably until april 2009
1865170 to those who criticize the government for this development i say take a look at vietnam where the inflation rate at 26 4 percent is more than double what we are facing
1865171 the church holds that it is not admissible to ordain women to the priesthood for very fundamental reasons these reasons include the example recorded in the sacred scriptures of christ choosing his apostles only from among men the constant practice of the church which has imitated christ in choosing only men and her living teaching authority which has consistently held that the exclusion of women from the priesthood is in accordance with gods plan for his church
1865172 its like pregancy only women can have a child because men cant have children doesnt mean theyre unequal to women its just that different genders have different functions
1865173 that is why the president is hastening the implementation of the national social welfare program so that government can help the poorest of the poor
1865174 urgent series of tests conducted at fort detrick maryland and elsewhere
1865175 so i asked how people should believe this given that theres no way to know where the information is coming from
1865176 his basic answer was that brian ross and abc news have reputations for being highly regarded journalistic outlets so we put our credibility behind the story and that should lead people to believe that this is credible
1865177 i dont know the answers to any of those questions
1865178 my main point is that we ought to know the answers to those questions and thats the only way we are going to know them through an investigation the striking fact about all this is that the anthrax attacker according to the government worked at the very same place the anonymous source came from which was fort detrick maybe it was a complete coincidence but it seems pretty significant to me that if a person from the same place where the perpetrator worked created a false story linking the attacks to something different its a very worthwhile reason for an investigation
1865179 i think first of all that this is a basic principal of journalism that if you get a story wrong you explain what happened that led to the bad reporting
1865180 thats what the new york times did to explain how they got those judy miller stories wrong when people get stories wrong the credibility of the journalistic outlet depends upon them explaining what happened if brian ross wants to say our sources acted in good faith they just got it wrong then he needs to explain the basis of that
1865181 at the very least abc should be working right now on some grand mea culpa along the lines of what the times did after the judith miller stories or even going back further to jayson blair
1865182 pretty much setting out not that we got this story wrong we know that but how we got it wrong what systemically allowed us to get this story so wrong and to flog it to the point that it was being used to embroil america in war i really think at the very least thats what they owe their viewers and themselves
1865183 now theres always a possibility that the sources were working in good faith that they were just supremely stupid or misinformed and got the story wrong
1865184 if thats the case it clouds the issue abc better be damn sure that these people were actually lying to them that they were specifically trying to mislead brian ross in the aims of furthering some sinister end before they can out them but i generally agree with the sentiment that investigative journalism is devoted to transparency and anonymity is a weapon for transparency it allows people with access to sensitive information to shield themselves from any backlash when a source uses that privilege of anonymity to push an agenda then i think a journalist is released from an obligation to protect that sources identity at all cost
1865185 its not a zero sum game where if i gave you bad information and therefore youre dead to me

1865505 the objective of this trip was to have substantive discussions with people like president karzai or prime minister maliki or president sarkozy or others who i expect to be dealing with over the next
1865506 and its important for me to have a relationship with them early that i start listening to them now getting a sense of what their interests and concerns are
1865507 we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded

1865530 art spinella of cnw research found that used car dealers are spending more money on the internet than ever before however overall most of the marketing funds are still going into traditional media such as newspapers spot tv and local radio
1865531 more than 44 percent of people who entered a dealership and purchased a car or truck indicated traditional advertising methods were what drove them to a store
1865532 the conversion rate for internet advertising was a dismal 4 5 percent even though it generated far more phone calls and e mails about advertised vehicles
1865533 but 95 percent either went elsewhere or were merely window shopping with little or no intent to buy
1865534 i have seen only one car commercial worse than that this is more low budget than the other one ive seen but this one lacks the ability to make you want to murder people
1865535 if you are not spending a minimum of 700 per month on your website your website is probably not attracting the leads necessary to really be effective
1865536 well get your dealership on the first page of google
1865537 you say you guarantee page 1 of the big search engines how much of the monthly payment to you is actually allocated to the keyword spending

1865541 this long term lease agreement is a key component of googles strategy for continued growth in silicon valley

1865543 please understand my reasons for not speaking today i am participating in the day of silence a national youth movement protesting the silence faced my lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people and their allies my deliberate silence echoes that silence which is caused by harassment prejudice and discrimination i believe that ending the silence is just the first step toward fighting these injustices think about the voices you are not hearing today
1865544 i think one of the biggest challenges is that most social media efforts are performed in isolation that they are not seen as part of an overarching business strategy
1865545 truth is that social media is the responsibility of the champions that demonstrate how it will benefit the company and the brand
1865546 im asking delta to compensate me with a written apology and 2 round trip first class tickets to anywhere in the world

1865549 dabur vatika miss nepal 2008 beauty pageant has been postponed indefinitely after the maoist threats to disrupt the show

1865552 the directions have been issued for effective appeal for the implementation of the seven point agreement signed by the political parties
1865553 ill treatment and torture of detainees were systematically used during the conflict but it would be wrong for us to think that their use ceased after the conflict ended or even that it did not occur before the conflict in many parts of the country these violations of human rights continue in places of detention thus ending ill treatment and torture remains as important today as it has ever been
1865554 the state has an obligation to make torture a criminal offence and to encourage investigation and prosecution of acts of torture however it is not enough to have a good legal framework the law must be implemented and established patterns of behaviour have to be changed this requires commitment from those in positions of authority and the tireless efforts of civil society

1865569 randal used to live with the indians they were a peaceable tribe who raised cattle he wasnt born indian but there was a period in his life where the ways of the indian seemed more noble and honest than the ways of the white man

1865593 allah akan meninggikan orang orang yang beriman di antaramu dan orang orang yang diberi ilmu pengetahuan beberapa derajat dan allah maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan
1865594 adakah sama orang orang yang mengetahui dengan orang orang yang tidak mengetahui
1865595 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama
1865596 adakah sama antara orang orang yang mengetahui dengan orang orang yang tidak mengetahui
1865597 allah akan meninggikan orang orang yang beriman diantaramu dan orang orang yang diberi ilmu pengetahuan beberapa derajat
1865598 barangsiapa berjalan di satu jalan dalam rangka menuntut ilmu maka allah mudahkan jalan menuju surga dan sesungguhnya malaikat meletakkan sayap sayapnya bagi penunutu ilmu tanda ridha dengan yang dia perbuat dari hadits yang panjang riwayat muslim
1865599 barangsiapa keluar dalam rangka thalabul ilmu mencari ilmu maka dia berada dalam sabilillah hingga kembali
1865600 barangsiap menempuh jalan untuk mencari ilmu maka allah mudahkan baginya jalan menuju surga
1865601 barangsiapa yang allah kehendaki padanya kebaikan maka allah akan pahamkan dia dalam masalah dien agama
1865602 apabila anak cucu adam itu wafat maka terputuslah amalannya kecuali tiga perkara sedekah jariyah ilmu yang bermanfaat dan anak sholih yang mendoakan orangtuanya
1865603 dan seandainya pohon pohon di bumi menjadi pena dan laut menjadi tinta ditambahkan kepadanya tujuh laut lagi sesudah kering nya niscaya tidak akan habis habisnya dituliskan kalimat ilmu dan hikmah allah sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
1865604 ialah ilmu yang bertujuan untuk mengetahui keluhuran keagungan kebesaran dan kesempurnaan kekuasaan ku atas segala sesuatu inilah yang mendekatkan engkau kepada ku
1865605 tuntutlah ilmu sesungguhnya menuntut ilmu adalah pendekatan diri kepada allah azza wa jalla sedangkan mengajarkannya kepada orang yang tidak mengetahuinya adalah shadaqah sesungguhnya ilmu pengetahuan adalah keindahan bagi ahlinya didunia dan akhirat
1865606 barangsiapa mengamalkan apa apa yang ia ketahui maka allah akan mewariskan kepadanya ilmu yang belum diketahuinya dan allah akan menolong dia dalam amalan nya sehingga ia mendapatkan surga
1865607 hadits begitu juga amal tanpa ilmu hanya akan membawa kehancuran contohnya orang tidak pernah belajar menerbangkan pesawat tentu akan berbahaya jika dia menerbangkan pesawat setelah diamalkan maka disunnahkan bagi kita untuk mengajarkan ilmu tersebut ke orang lain yang belum mengetahui
1865608 menuntut ilmu itu wajib bagi setiap orang islam laki laki maupun perempuan
1865609 barangsiapa menuntut ilmu yang biasanya ditujukan untuk mencari keridhaan allah tiba tiba ia tidak mempelajarinya kecuali hanya untuk mendapatkan harta benda keduniaan maka ia tidak akan memperoleh bau harumnya surga pada hari kiamat
1865610 janganlah kalian menuntut ilmu untuk membanggakannya terhadap para ulama dan untuk diperdebatkan di kalangan orang orang bodoh dan buruk perangainya jangan pula menuntut ilmu untuk penampilan dalam majelis pertemuan atau rapat dan untuk menarik perhatian orang orang kepadamu barangsiapa seperti itu maka baginya neraka neraka
1865611 seorang alim apabila menghendaki dengan ilmunya keridhaan allah maka dia akan ditakuti oleh segalanya akan tetapi jika dia bermaksud untuk menumpuk harta maka dia akan takut dari segala sesuatu

1865615 the question of religion is a very sensitive area you bar council are playing with fire we think it is one of the elements of freedom and it is our rights but dont think in implementing our rights others dont have their rights so i do not want to speculate on what kind of action we would take

1865619 virtually everybody was frankly slow in recognizing that we were on the cusp of a really draconian crisis
1865620 the real artist would be interested in realities and not in imitations
1865621 mechanical reproduction of a work of art represents something new
1865622 the eye perceives more swiftly than the hand can draw
1865623 even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element its presence in time and space its unique existence at the place where it happens to be
1865624 this unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject during the time of its existence
1865625 this its history includes changes which it may have suffered in physical condition over the years as well as the various changes in its ownership
1865626 selects rejects organizes discriminates associates classifies analyzes and constructs it does not so much mirror as take and make and what it takes and makes it sees not bare as items without attribution but as things nothing is seen naked
1865627 the meaning of any photograph is highly dependent on the context in which it appears
1865628 the texts that surround the photograph eliminate any residual ambiguity and decide the meaning of the picture

1865630 in themselves determine how viewers are to understand the photograph
1865631 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
1865632 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
1865633 the big media has tried to be responsible and handle this with kid gloves but its clearly getting ready to bust out
1865634 you want to address these issues long before you get to that point
1865635 otherwise people who havent written about it before now start writing about it
1865636 yeah right mom ill just go on my merry way and forget about you not
1865637 words that describe goods of potential value that have been thrown into the ocean
1865638 we dont know at this point whether the grapes were red grapes green grapes or black grapes which are really more of a purple color
1865639 i asked brett what kind of grapes he was eating as he stepped off the plane but he only smiled as he refused comment the smile was quick perhaps a slow motion replay will reveal a stained color to favres teeth which may offer a clue into the type of grapes favre had been eating
1865640 if the grapes were red it might suggest that brett is leaning toward tampa bay if the grapes were green he may be favoring playing for the jets but if the grapes were black which is really more of a dark purple if you think about it we might see the man who led the packers to two super bowl victories suiting up in a vikings jersey in the 2008 season black grapes would be quite a shock to green bay fans who can hardly picture their star playing for their divisional rival
1865641 it only makes sense for favre to be eating green grapes the jets clearly have made the best offer to the great one it only makes sense that someone so talented as he would want to take his talents to the biggest stage in the country hell be greater than namath thats the only place i see brett favre playing next year
1865642 grapes are a wonderful alternative to peanuts which are loaded with salt and saturated fats neither of those do anything for my skin i only eat grapes when i fly
1865643 if favre were a real man hed be eating fried pork skins instead of that yuppie fruit stuff thats right when i was playing in the league wed play with the football then wed cook the football and eat it
1865644 what are we doing talking about what some nfl quarterback is eating on a plane flight when weve got great baseball games on today mark teixeria was traded last week but nobody seemed to notice around here come on guys baseball is the national pasttime
1865645 oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to decieve
1865646 one of these things is not like the others one of these things just doesnt belong
1865647 final draft came to me from the u s side
1865648 seek the broadest possible consensus within the country to enable the next steps to be taken
1865649 same responsibilities and obligations as other advanced nuclear states like the u s
1865650 just wanted to let me know it was an option
1865651 do the artists that live here already even know about this program
1865652 ive published a lot of forecasting papers over the years
1865653 papers that are about things that had not yet happened when the paper was published but would happen within some reasonable amount of time theres a track record that i can point to
1865654 the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago the second best time is now
1865655 time will tell if this is the beginning or just another event of no consequence
1865656 for those of us who despair about christianity and judaism having gone astray the notion that islam might be the spark that generates a new religious revival based on mutual respect and spiritual intensity could dramatically expand our understanding of the endless potential for god to surprise us
1865657 islam is a moderate culture and we are determined to prevent extremists from hijacking islam
1865658 for international organizations to work to issue a document stating respect of faiths and religious symbols and criminalizing those insulting them
1865659 now i got to go through all this shit again man
1865660 these rules are made to break and these walls are built to fall these rules are made to break us all
1865661 im falling more in love with every single word i withhold
1865662 no one will ever see things the way i do no one wil try all my friends think that im gone but i swear i swear im not
1865663 so lets make a list of who we need its not much if anything lets make a list of who we need then well throw it away cause we dont need anyone
1865664 set fire to the preacher who is promising us hell
1865665 listen to our lives the wind will whisper the way it is im going to happen
1865666 look through a faithless eye are you afraid to die
1865667 hope and i hope youve seen the light cause no one really cares theyre just pretending
1865668 god and death are none of my concern im no philosopher
1865669 eat sleep fuck and flee in four words thats me i am full of indifference
1865670 and i am done with this i want to taste the breeze of every great city
1865671 dont you come near me dont you come close to me why dont you fear me
1865672 you can prove anything and everything with such deceitful methods
1865673 leviticus 19 26 28 is a clear condemnation of pagan witchcraft and heathen practices
1865674 the fact is up until a few years ago virtually everyone including the most liberal christian knew the tattoo was clearly forbidden by the word of god and throughout history the tattoo has always been condemned by bible believing christians always every historical resource ever written on tattoos clearly confirms this fact
1865675 and they were wisely forbidden for they were signs of apostasy and when once made they were insuperable obstacles to a return
1865676 and what of christ himself twice in chapter 19 our lord is depicted as having a name written on him verses 12 and 16 as unthinkable as it may be for some to picture our lord jesus as having a tattoo the author of the apocalypse had no problem with it

1865680 whoa theres something else going on here theres more than meets the eye
1865681 to exist is to change to change is to mature to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly
1865682 there has never been a proven association of dinosaur prints with human footprints
1865683 i said it looks like something has been washed out of this hole
1865684 i seen the human track coming out and saw that it was a man
1865685 i thought to myself lord ive been shown man was here when the dinosaur was here
1865686 when i found it i said this has to get to someone who knows it
1865687 i took it to dr baugh he liked to have a heart attack over it he shed some tears
1865688 the compression lines the density features do show and there is no way to fake that
1865689 it is possible to carve a track in limestone but there is no way to compress the material in the rock under the track that is absolutely impossible thats why the cat scans are so important
1865690 during locomotion thats very important that distribution is shown here compression is in the right place under both prints density compression distribution the density factor is there weight distribution forward locomotion rocking of the foot
1865691 within minutes or no more than hours of each other
1865692 i know its going to change history thats pretty heavy
1865693 disprove darwins theory god made man man did not evolve from ape
1865694 i have really worked hard to figure out how it could be faked
1865695 when i saw this i said this is too good to be true
1865696 if someone found a way to fake that they could also get a patent for concrete that would far surpass anything
1865697 i dont think it is going to displace the theory of evolution
1865698 my hope is that the scientific concepts of archeology and paleontology will be used under the guidelines of the texas schoolbook committee any evidence supporting that should be presented and hopefully this particular fossil will be presented for the students to be able to see that there is evidence supporting an alternative concept as opposed to just evolution
1865699 i foretold the former things long ago my mouth announced them and i made them known then suddenly i acted and they came to pass
1865700 how do the soldiers clean the chainsaw bayonet what does their armor feel like
1865701 for free really maybe i should look into being a flight attendant

1865704 oh you have some muscle youre scaring me a little
1865705 they are used to being long term political prisoners and their health is failing
1865706 go to work go to work amp go to work
1865707 how many pilgrims came to the holy city this year
1865708 none of them however in baghdad there is a shoemaker called ali mufiq who did not make the pilgrimage but did have his pilgrimage accepted and his graces benefited the 600 000 pilgrims
1865709 at great cost and much sacrifice i finally managed to get 350 coins together
1865710 but then when i was ready to go to i discovered that my neighbors were hungry so i distributed the money among them and gave up my pilgrimage
1865711 go to the town and ask someone else cant you see that you are bothering me i am trying to communicate with the angels
1865712 god placed himself lower than men washed their feet gave his life and no one recognized him
1865713 he who says he loves god who does not see and forgets his brother who does is lying
1865714 you condemned your brother but you did not say what punishment we should inflict the pains of hell some terrible disease in this life some torment in his family
1865715 us fat girls want to hear about more than shakes diet advice and how much weights been taken off
1865716 when i am demanded to know what had happened from the soundman the cornered man said the mayors were annoyed and i was told to cut the show from here
1865717 we publicly complained to walter towers as well as the president of the association of mayors and to the governor of puerto rico because this is a censorship that goes against the freedom of expression the artists and the democracy
1865718 this was definitely a joint effort of many units within and outside of multi national division center that led to the recovery of these two warriors
1865719 i would have to say i consider it an honor to have been involved in the recovery of these two soldiers
1865720 we look forward to working together with the government of iraq to bring the criminals and terrorists responsible for the ambush kidnapping and death of the these soldiers to justice
1865721 bodies of army spc alex r jimenez and pfc byron fouty found in iraq
1865722 one has to ask how mr wright would have felt in vietnam to be compared to a servant of roman tyranny
1865723 a nation capable of greatness is also capable of cruelty
1865724 when something is taken like a sound bite for a political purpose and put constantly over and over again looped in the face of the public thats not a failure to communicate
1865725 if you see it touch it if you touch it feel it if you feel it love it if you love it give it
1865726 if this is marxism then i am not a marxist
1865727 poetry is sane because it floats easily in an infinite sea the maniac seeks to cross the infinite sea and so make it finite
1865728 there is a deep feeling that the current picture is not beautiful and that drive for beauty simplicity and symmetry has been an unfailing guidepost with how to go with physics
1865729 we havent gotten to the bottom level yet but as we approach it we pick up information of the underlying beautiful theory whose beauty we can only dimly see at the present time we dont know that its true that there really is a beautiful underlying theory and we dont know as a species we are smart enough to learn what it is but we do know that if we dont assume that there is a beautiful underlying theory and that we are smart enough to learn what it is we never will
1865730 to my mind there must be at the bottom of it all not an utterly simple equation but an utterly simple idea and to me that idea when we finally discover it will be so compelling so inevitable so beautiful that we will all say to each other oh how could it have been otherwise
1865731 there is nothing deader than an equation you write that down on a square on a tile floor then on another tile you write another equation which you think will be a better description of the universe and you keep writing down more and more equations hoping to get a better and better equation for explaining why the universe acts the way it does and then when you work your way out to the end of the room and have to step out you wave your wand and tell the equations to fly and that one of the equations will fly but the universe flies it has a life to it that no equation has and that life to it is a life in which we also are tied up
1865732 the design that one sees in the universe may be as natural as an outcome of the differential equations but the mystery is possibly put best the current scientific zeitgeist when saying
1865733 made it his life mission to destroy the subsistence of every part who contradicted him or did not grant the kind of he ordered whether it was legal or not
1865734 nor one nor the other confirm nor deny the existance of an examination
1865735 does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1865736 its a beautiful place in fall with the colors changing
1865737 but in winter it can be very comfortless there are city blocks that are abandoned the woods have power to be brutal we didnt want to go the cgi terraqueous globe
1865738 it gives you a great quantity greater degree to work with if youre filming in that earth in place of a green screen movie in a way you dont have to in a book even a book as powerful as that
1865739 i think whats made this incident so universally loved is because its really about protecting your child no matter what the circumstances
1865740 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
1865741 i believe that marriages that have been entered into subsequent to the may 15 supreme court opinion will be recognized by the california supreme court
1865742 i would think the court in looking at the underlying equities would most probably conclude that upholding the marriages performed in that interval before the election would be a just result
1865743 i will be doing a red carpet look that still reflects the undesigning classic brew of the lauren conrad collection but with a pitchy tie twist
1865744 i dont believe in reality tv stars turning into designers
1865745 i will probably never have the respect i want in the cut industry but i can work hard every day to try and put to the test myself
1865746 he has gotten me through a lot of tough times i would confident what he has to say i accept a lot of venerate for him
1865747 its funny and absurd the reality show thing is completely made up and not true
1865748 the paparazzi and the tour buses mess up traffic and the crew members are all right and left
1865749 the filming permit is valid and is operating in accordance
1865750 we will continue to work with the tour buses and paparazzi as they disturb the streets
1865751 this is whichs known in the same manner with a high class problem for the people that are fault finding you are in the middle of hollywood go move to the desert
1865752 i regard to bow down again to the one and the other of you for bringing it on
1865753 its like youre dancing from a place thats not physical anymore
1865754 dancing like a unit in concert and i think that theres nothing more incredible than that
1865755 katees got that little bit that makes you go wow
1865756 everything youve done over this season has been so surprising to watch
1865757 im just so delighted that youre in the top four
1865758 when i first saw you in the first show i thought theres a thing really cool about that guy
1865759 i was happy when you were in the bottom three because it meant i got to see one of your solos
1865760 youre two of the most expedient see the various meanings of good dancers weve ever had on this show
1865761 you have set the standard for next season with untrained dancers joshua didnt get training and look how brilliant he was
1865762 there is not a single sign of an unmanageable flood of traffic if anything a slowdown is visible more than a speedup this suggests that the industry might benefit from shifting its emphasis towards methods of stimulating traffic growth
1865763 now annual traffic growth rates of 50 percent when combined with cost declines on the order of 33 percent result in no net increase in costs to provide the increased transmission capacity
1865764 in a competitive environment that means no increase in revenues which is hardly a cheering prospect for the industry if traffic growth could be pushed back towards 100 percent where it used to be for many years we would have pressure for increased revenues and also for new technologies
1865765 mom since i got such a good grade on this test can i have a pet
1865766 thanks to you son i havent had a wife for the past 8 months
1865767 well i think he is a little too young for her anyway
1865768 really the only authentic response to a youtube video is another youtube video the so called
1865769 i find myself hanging on the edge of my seat clasping my hand to my forehead
1865770 im actually rooting for her in the end not to make the same mistakes she just painted out three or four times earlier
1865771 ill need that to get my homework done in about half an hour
1865772 ive never seen so much vomit in my life it just kept coming
1865773 the van smells like febreeze and the inside of megs stomach
1865774 yeah there is man get up we have to catch this thing
1865775 if i break one of these i cant pay you back seriously i dont have the money
1865776 the oilers are a good team with or without wayne gretzky
1865777 i put the top on and i looked so good im so happy i feel complete
1865778 the mcguinty liberals brutal approach of denying children with autism their therapy is callous and heartless how can the mcguinty liberals so cruelly stand by and watch as these services that entire communities of children and parents rely on are cutback
1865779 i want to express my sincere sympathy to the family for the loss of what was her first name
1865780 so how do you like being almost a half century old
1865781 what a blessing it is for the united states to have in canada a neighbour we fear only on ice rinks and baseball diamonds
1865782 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1865783 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1865784 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1865785 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1865786 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1865787 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
1865788 to refuse to come here would be to give in to hate and prejudice
1865789 i seek the support of all citizens of harris county
1865790 we treat all persons in our court with fairness and dignity
1865791 our goal is to make early stage digital assets resemble their final on screen forms as closely as possible starting with accurate models makes the production process more efficient and provides a higher quality end result for example youd want to know early on whether a prominent brow will shadow a characters eyes thats why autodesk mudbox 2009 has texture painting tools and on target display features these will help artists build and refine better 3d models
1865792 the introduction of autodesk mudbox 2009 sparks a revolution in computer graphics tools bringing about a paradigm shift in how designers and artists do their work
1865793 time is money an autodesk mudbox session begins with its artist friendly intuitive interface this is sculpting at the speed of thought with the greatest of fidelity in a business where new ideas with impossible deadlines are commonplace mudbox never lets me down
1865794 i know i should know you but i cant remember exactly how i know you
1865795 well when something like this happens you find out quick who your friends are and i appreciate it
1865796 if i had a tumor underneath my genitals when girls were passing by id be a very grumpy boy too
1865797 i think hell be at these girls long after im gone
1865798 im excited but i dont want to get too excited because mother natures always got the power to ground you
1865799 i really dont like counting the chickens before they hatch but each day that goes by im becoming more confident theyre going to be fine
1865800 the government of mexico sent the u s department of state a diplomatic note of protest for this violation of international law expressing its concern for the precedent that it may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1865801 the ministry of foreign relations reiterates that the importance of this case fundamentally stems from the respect to the right to consular access and protection provided by consulates of every state to each of its nationals abroad
1865802 we continue to seek a practical and timely way to carry out our nations international legal obligation
1865803 a goal that the united states needs the assistance of texas to achieve
1865804 with this action our nation has broken a commitment willingly made by our president and our senate
1865805 we must now hope that other nations stand stronger in their promises than we do lest our own citizens be placed at risk elsewhere
1865806 now that there is no way for you to get out of having the birth its time well go through all the painful details of childbirth
1865807 given this poor performance we fear that the quality of patient care may suffer at anaheim memorial under phcs ownership
1865808 we think that anaheim memorial should stay a nonprofit hospital and serve the community
1865809 we are concerned the level of care will deteriorate if the hospital is bought
1865810 we plan to continue the legacy of outstanding medical care that anaheim memorial medical center is so well known for
1865811 we are aware anaheim general is correcting several safety issues and the attorney general is taking them into serious deliberation
1865812 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
1865813 i dont know anything other than what happened today on the practice field and i dont want to address any more speculation at this point bretts situation will resolve itself during the coming days i would assume but at this point and time all i can comment on is our football team and what we did today
1865814 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1865815 just how he was doing where he was with the process things like that
1865816 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
1865817 obviously theres no closure as of yet but i think weve kind of been told whats going on and i think we all kind of know where everything stands
1865818 from what i understand for the most part its taken care of
1865819 now its just about the packers and not about the situation its over now from what i understand its pretty much over
1865820 i think for the most part the locker room would have liked to see him back here but like i say once youre on another team
1865821 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1865822 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1865823 i really feel like that concept of enjoying the now and not worrying about the future is what my coach has been trying to teach me for 14 years and that is what has made me such a different athlete 10 years later and that is what has made me strong enough mentally to make this olympic team
1865824 its difficult to let go of the expectations you have for your child you have to kind of come to the realization that the things you thought he might become or the experiences you think are normal for your children sometimes dont happen for a child with autism
1865825 it was about letting go and finally embracing who he was and to not think too much about the future and just enjoy who he is now
1865826 people look at me funny when i say that weightlifting is the easiest part of my day but its true
1865827 i would trade every minute in international competition for a cure for autism
1865828 to live in a way that our own life would enhance the lives of others is a radical concept as it gets to the very root of how happiness comes about if we want to be happy we do what we can to bring others happiness not suffering yogis by nature are radical not content to live superficial lives but instead they enjoy diving into root causes
1865829 private undercover investigations such as the one we conducted play an important role in raising public awareness but they cannot substitute for effective day to day oversight of all slaughter plants by the responsible agency
1865830 sick and injured cattle are still being slaughtered and funneled into the american food supply under current agency rules this is a reckless and cruel policy and i am frankly shocked that the industry and the usda continue to insist on taking these risks in the face of clear public outrage about the abuse of downers
1865831 one of the major causes of the worlds most pressing environmental problems
1865832 in the remaining reports of delirium with impulsive behavior and self injury patients were attempting to flee or escape from windows or balconies and were unsuccessful in their efforts
1865833 fatalities have occurred in adult and pediatric patients in japan the onset may be abrupt and fatal events have occurred even while the patient was being monitored
1865834 information about the problem of antimicrobial resistance recommendations as to possible approaches to contain the problem of antimicrobial resistance responses to specific questions and other pertinent information from interested parties information is also sought on which serious and life threatening infectious diseases such as diseases due to gram negative bacteria and other diseases due to antimicrobial resistant bacteria potentially qualify for available grants and contracts or other development incentives
1865835 commonly reported circulating levels in humans exceed the circulating levels extrapolated from acute exposure studies in laboratory animals
1865836 you cant sit on the floor of the capitol building
1865837 people ask me well how can you do that its simple i gave it up you know why because im insignificant
1865838 setan akan mendatangi salah seorang dari kalian lalu membisikkannya siapa yang menciptakan ini siapa yang menciptakan itu sampai kemudian ia akan membisikkan siapa yang menciptakan allah jika dia sampai pada tingkatan itu maka hendaklah ia memohon perlindungan kepada allah 1 dan berhenti
1865839 maka hendaklah ia mengatakan aku beriman kepada allah dan rasul rasul nya
1865840 hadits ini menjelaskan bahwa setan pasti akan melontarkan pertanyaan yang batil tersebut baik sekedar bisikan belaka yang disusupkan ke dalam
1865841 im receiving a message in biztalk which is triggering an orchestration instance the orchestration does this and that and if it any of those things fail i want to put the message back where i got it from
1865842 failed however might not be that simple not all actions your orchestration might do can be undone
1865843 heeft net plaats gemaakt en vertrekt met een lading zout
1865844 the sony ericsson c905 cybershot camera phone has been developed to make us all better photographers that means making it easier to take great shots and never missing that magic moment
1865845 the 8 1 megapixel sony ericsson c905 is a viable alternative to a digital camera
1865846 o time todo est dedicado a trazer a experi ncia incr vel do game para o pc o jogo tem umbelo visual e roda magnificamente no pc mal podemos esperar para as pessoas jogarem
1865847 we know everybody in our division can and has beaten us everybody we play they all know how to win we dont sit there and say well we got this one we got that one boy that will be a tough one we know theyre all gonna be tough
1865848 weve got outstanding coaches weve got outstanding players weve got some experience but so does everybody else
1865849 it comes down to preparation it goes back to work ethic
1865850 it goes back to breaking it down into the least common denominator the smallest frame of time which is each day and even within the day each practice and within the practice each rep you have got to take advantage of this moment to build that block strong enough so when you get to the season you have a chance to have the great things that you want to happen if you think too far down the road and you dont prepare on a daily basis and you lose a day or two because you think youre it you wont be ready at the moment of truth
1865851 knowshon is versatile enough to do something besides just be an i back no question matthew can certainly play under center his whole high school career he was in the gun hes got much more running ability than i think people give him credit for we have incorporated quarterback run with matthew because hes a legitimate runner hes a guy that if you dont make a plan for him then you could get hurt by him
1865852 a more mature line that gives you more versatility i mean last year we had three freshmen starting for us and you cant be quite as creative when the line cant quite hold up like you want it to down after down
1865853 we have one junior lineman no senior linemen we have one junior lineman vince vance thats our junior but hes only been here two years the rest are freshmen and sophomores yes three did start last year but we literally could be starting you know four sophomores and a true freshman possibly thats still a very young unit hopefully well be a little bit better up front earlier in the season and that will help us too

1865991 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
1865992 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
1865993 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc

1866014 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house bush ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1866015 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1866016 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1866017 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1866018 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1866019 suskind writes in his new book that the order to create the letter was written on creamy white house stationery the book suggests that the letter was subsequently created by the cia and delivered to iraq the author claims that such an operation part of false pretenses for war would apparently constitute illegal white house use of the cia to influence a domestic audience an arguably impeachable offense

1866043 guys i dont know what you are talking about yesterday i was working in my q1 and i was thinking for myself im so happy with vista responds time in my q1 that im afraid to move on to any of the new coming umpcs i have been optimizing it but not so deep as others i do not have any more those hdd bashing the only thing that i would improve would be the time to come back from hibernation but i have to say also that i have a lot of programs working in my taskbar and around 70 process running all time and thats in a q1 celeron running at 900 mhz i tested vista in a eo v7110 via it was slow and once the beta expired and have not comeback to vista i stayed in xp because i considered vista too much for that processor but i had only 1 gb in that machine while in my q1 i have 2 gb and i mention this ram difference because believe me vista does not run well in 1 gb of ram the performance is increased a lot just by adding that extra gibabyte in conclusion i think that vista is perfect for umpcs but it has to be optimized i think that microsoft should create some kind of optimization profiles where people can select what is better for them and i say this because im that james kevin and other people reading our blogs can follow our optimization instructions but thats probably 10 or less of all consumers
1866044 saya berkata bahwa plank dan dawkins benar sebab yang terjadi adalah beberapa orang telah mengeksploitasi istilah mukjizat secara murahan mereka jadikan itu sebagai dalih untuk menutupi kecekakan serta kekurangpengetahuan mereka lalu mereka juga dengan gampangnya melempar tanggung jawab kepada allah setiap kali mereka tidak mampu menjelaskan sesuatu bahwa ini sudah ketetapan allah lah atau bahwa ini adalah tindakan allah lah jadi ya terima saja dan jangan banyak bertanya itu sebabnya saya katakan adalah perkembangan yang baik dan sehat bila ilmu pengetahuan terus berkembang serta menyingkirkan cara cara berpikir yang naif cupet dan simplistik seperti itu
1866045 yang saya maksud dengan mukjizat bukan itu bagi saya mukjizat merujuk pada peristiwa peristiwa di mana secara sah kita dapat memastikan bahwa ada kekuatan kekuatan non manusiawi yang ikut campur dalam prosesnya singkatnya mukjizat adalah yang sepenuhnya dan sesungguhnya merupakan tindakan allah mukjizat dalam pengertian ini tidak akan pernah terdesak atau terdepak oleh perkembangan ilmu pengetahuan ia tidak didasarkan pada kekurangpengetahuan manusia ia tidak bertentangan dengan ilmu pengetahuan dan dikuatkan oleh bukti bukti sejarah

1866067 the proposed legislation will not only hinder free speech by korean netizens but seems to be aimed at controlling the public opinion of internet news media
1866068 such measures would not help to promote the democratic development of the korean press and could end up turning back the internet clock in korea
1866069 theres been a huge groundswell in green building leadership at state and local levels its remarkable
1866070 it requires a mandate in order to get people to do whats in their best interests sometimes
1866071 there needs to be a broad based campaign to reject the deal
1866072 well i was standing there minding my own business and decided to buy a puffle when i went in i noticed the box to the left of me with the black blue etc coloured puffles then my friend asked for a game of find four so of course i played i won after about 15 turns then went back when i got it i looked in the box instead of the green puffle there was a yellow i was astounished
1866073 i thought what i turned in would be enough for a passing good grade
1866074 america is democratic in everything but education in education we are socialistic
1866075 do able however the four steps would have to be introduced over a span of time
1866076 what can i do to get out of this work
1866077 i believe self and peer assessement is a life skill and must be a part of any worthy educators classroom because the heavens know we will and are tested in life and the real world the only practice we receive comes from the erady for this the classroom
1866078 who will tell this child what to do when they are older
1866079 i am not only here to teach you english i am also here to teach you how to make good decisions be a better person and how to cope in the community outside of school
1866080 i am convinced that life is 10 what happens to me and 90 how i react to it
1866081 you dont want to have to go to summer school you dont want to be here an extra year if we dont meet ayp we will all be unhappy
1866082 if it worked for us it will work for them
1866083 we need to back off and let the kids help themselves
1866084 tell me i forget show me i remember involve me i understand
1866085 since the beginning of time children have not liked to study they would much rather play and if you have their interests at heart you will let them learn while they play they will find that what they have mastered is childs play
1866086 helicopter or hovering parent is most responcible for perpetuating the myth
1866087 self discovered learning is the only learning that significantly influences a persons behavior however i believe that the mind must be in a receiving mode for learning to take place this book has been a real guilt trip for me ayp overrides everything
1866088 we do research on some aspect of our curriculum and then we cant wait to tell our students what we have discovered
1866089 holding tightly onto the hands of our students for too long can lead to negative side effects
1866090 gorging on information for the sole purpose of regurgitating it is informational bulimia which leads to intellectual anorexia
1866091 remove the negative stigma and turn failure into a learning experience
1866092 independent and higher learning because most teachers teach as they were taught teaching in a new way can also be very intimidating because we are pressed for time and meeting standards
1866093 test scores fo not give a complete picture of what students are capable of accomplishing in their schooling
1866094 teachers are here to give students the necessary tools for a fundamental education were not hand holders nose blowers shoe tiers pencil and paper givers basically were not parents or wal mart students first need to learn to be responsible for themselves and their education then we would see a change the education systems of the past worked ask your parents what has been added or taken away since then discipline student and parent responsibility and the time to teach need i say more
1866095 let someone else do the work and ill copy it leaners
1866096 independent and higher learning problem first teaching second but some times these modern approaches get bigger than what our purpose really is teaching children to function well in our society
1866097 technology skills are secondary in importance to problem solving skills
1866098 technology is the expression of the society it is an expression of the values and the abilities of the people that generate it it is indeed a most revealing indicator of our society and the fact is that technology in turn shapes the values of a society and of its people
1866099 the educational system is clearly out of sync with the realities of the world outside
1866100 technology skills are secondary in importance to problem solving skills
1866101 do i attempt to tie my shoes now or wait til i or someone else falls over them
1866102 our teaching reinforces school skills much more than real world skills
1866103 how did you figure that out why did you do it that way could you do it differently
1866104 our students dont have the technology and cultural advantages of larger schools but they do just as well in college
1866105 technology skills are secondary in importance to problem solving skills
1866106 just wait until you get out in the real world
1866107 if its not being evaluated then it wont be done
1866108 most students in high school do not attend universities or other postsecondary institution
1866109 our teaching reinforces school skills much more than real world skills
1866110 its time to rethink what we are trying to accomplish with our educational system
1866111 oh my how am i ever going to fit this in
1866112 i havent used a piece of paper my whole high school career
1866113 the best tour i took was with a group of radical reference librarians in town for the anarchist bookfair in golden gate park

1866115 the highest guess was more than five times higher than the lowest

1866117 dont beat yourself up so much about not being fluent yet youll catch up in no time when you move to brazil with your husband
1866118 but its brutally hard to shoot well the best times are nothing short of amazing almost unbelievable in fact its safe to say that the fastest guns who have ever lived are alive today and shooting this match
1866119 our worst fears were substantiated when we started going through information from the army
1866120 her body was dumped in a dirty filthy contractors tent
1866121 i cant believe manuels here its almost surreal to be drinking with him
1866122 we will remember those days fondly once the zombie apocalypse comes as we water the tetrad flesh of our family and friends who stumble toward us we will look at the new darkness and scream and it will scream right back at us
1866123 normality reminds me of mediocrity and mediocrity scares the fuck out of me
1866124 dont be drunk on the world but continually stand in the river of god and let his glory grace joy and righteousness and peace flood over you refilling you again and again
1866125 che qu haces por aca nada vine a saludar a los acomodadores vine a barrer y me voy qu carajos voy a estar haciendo en un cine en la cola para sacar entradas a ver decime
1866126 you always thought that i was stronger i may have failed but i have loved you from the start
1866127 im looking for the leon trotskys the philip roths the chaucers and the edith whartons of the wine world i want my wines to tell a good story i want them natural and most of all like my dear friends i want them to speak the truth even if we argue with this messiah thing going on im trying to swell the ranks of those who love the differences in each vintage who abhor homogenization who want wines that make them smile think laugh and feel sexy for better or worse it seems as if i am a wine cop traversing the earth writing and speaking my mind drinking and recommending wines that are honest

1866147 only twice during my 30 years of teaching about evolutionary biology and research into the origins of life have i encountered religious based opposition to my work in both cases it came from evangelical zealots from the united states preaching in mexico
1866148 one of the little recognized u s imports into mexico is a small flow of creationists who through religion are trying to impose their fundamentalist beliefs and hinder the teaching of darwinian evolution in all levels of schooling
1866149 they even found hilarious the idea of teaching creationism based on biblical literalism
1866150 in contrast mexico still maintains some anticlerical attitudes and public education bears the secular trademark of the enlightenment whose introduction into the country was facilitated by some prominent priests and jesuits

1866161 but should tnt have waited so they could give out some more quality items
1866162 well weve got quite a selection for you here today
1866163 also may i ask what the point of playing the lower brackets were even if you win your bracket what do you get nothing just a participant medal like everybody else
1866164 how to we know if our position is calculated by how much we play or if tnt already had all the positions planned since the beginning of the cup and all our playing is useless for your team
1866165 also may i ask what the point of playing the lower brackets were even if you win your bracket what do you get nothing just a participant medal like everybody else
1866166 the cup would be too predictable if every year the former champ gets demoted to 7th and the former runner up gets the gold wheres the fun in that thats why im rooting for ki in this match to break the chain and of course because kis my team xd anyway i think dc coming in 7th this year if they win against hw is because there was just other teams who were better just like mi playing in the 3rd bracket even though they are clearly a 2nd bracket team in terms of power my theory about the whole freeloaders bringing down powerhouses thing is that even though freeloaders dont exist they dont count towards the teams performance im basing my theory upon tnts statement that you can only help your team and not bring it down the only thing that brings a team down is the major players transferring to other teams because they fear the freeloaders without the major players wholl bring the average up thoughts on my theory

1866185 i hate video games on or offline i hate the way they suck real people into fake worlds and hold on to them for decades at a time i hate being made to feel hateful for saying so and i hate being told to immerse myself in them before passing judgment because it feels like being told to immerse myself in smack and teenage pregnancy before passing judgment on them this is not because of anything wrong or bad about video games or heroin or teenage parents its not even because of game induced homicide or web grooming of little girls by perverts serious problems but statistically low risk its because compared with everything else on offer in a kids life video games and heroin and teenage pregnancy are a colossal waste of time

1866199 hai orang orang yang beriman peliharalah dirimu dan keluargamu dari api neraka yang bahan bakarnya adalah manusia dan batu penjaganya malaikat malaikat yang kasar yang keras yang tidak mendurhakai allah terhadap apa yang diperintahkan nya kepada mereka dan selalu mengerjakan apa yang diperintahkan
1866200 ajarkanlah kepada keluargamu amalan ketaatan yang dapat menjaga diri mereka dari neraka
1866201 beramallah kalian dengan ketaatan kepada allah takutlah kalian untuk bermaksiat kepada nya dan perintahkan keluarga kalian untuk berdzikir niscaya allah menyelamatkan kalian dari neraka
1866202 peliharalah dirimu dari neraka yang bahan bakarnya manusia dan batu yang disediakan bagi orang orang kafir
1866203 api kalian yang dinyalakan oleh anak cucu adam ini hanyalah satu bagian dari 70 bagian neraka jahanam
1866204 aku melihat ke dalam surga maka aku melihat kebanyakan penduduknya adalah fuqara orang orang fakir dan aku melihat ke dalam neraka maka aku menyaksikan kebanyakan penduduknya adalah wanita
1866205 dan aku melihat neraka maka tidak pernah aku melihat pemandangan seperti ini sama sekali aku melihat kebanyakan penduduknya adalah kaum wanita
1866206 mereka kufur terhadap suami suami mereka kufur terhadap kebaikan kebaikannya
1866207 dan wanita wanita yang berpakaian tetapi hakikatnya mereka telanjang melenggak lenggokkan kepala mereka karena sombong dan berpaling dari ketaatan kepada allah dan suaminya kepala mereka seakan akan seperti punuk onta mereka tidak masuk surga dan tidak mendapatkan wanginya surga padahal wanginya bisa didapati dari jarak perjalanan sekian dan sekian
1866208 penyebab sedikitnya kaum wanita yang masuk surga adalah hawa nafsu yang mendominasi pada diri mereka kecondongan mereka kepada kesenangan kesenangan dunia dan berpaling dari akhirat karena kurangnya akal mereka dan mudahnya mereka untuk tertipu dengan kesenangan kesenangan dunia yang menyebabkan mereka lemah untuk beramal
1866209 allah tidak akan melihat kepada wanita yang tidak mensyukuri apa yang ada pada suaminya dan tidak merasa cukup dengannya
1866210 wanita mana saja yang meminta cerai pada suaminya tanpa sebab yang syari pent maka haram baginya wangi surga
1866211 wanita wanita yang dimaksudkan nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam adalah yang memakai pakaian yang tipis yang membentuk tubuhnya dan tidak menutupinya maka mereka adalah wanita wanita yang berpakaian pada dhahirnya dan telanjang pada hakikatnya

1866342 at ryz weve set out to create a peoples brand a community of designers sneakerheads and anyone that cares enough about art fashion or sneakers to speak up together well create sneakers that are designed and chosen not by some big faceless corporation but by you ryz as a stage for designers to showcase their creativity and a forum for people to define what great sneaker design means in other words we just make comfortable sneakers the rest is up to you
1866343 the corporation shouldnt be dictating what the consumer wears the consumers should
1866344 our timing wasnt great we couldnt get people to buy because they didnt trust the brand
1866345 now is a completely different time than in 2000 because there are so many different brands that are valid
1866346 essentially i had no budget and very little partnership dollars to create a custom shoe program that as you know can cost millions of dollars in order to complete the vision i needed to be creative and find partners
1866347 one solution i found through your writings is confego they were the second key to the solution i had the brand they had the process systems now i needed the community which is where zazzle com fit in
1866348 within 48 hours there have been over 18 000 designs published on zazzle can you imagine the dollars it would have taken an internal team to accomplish that feat no inventory to carry not guessing on what will sells at 60 per pair everyone is making margins well above including the factory
1866349 since the launch of the champion in 1916 consumers have been enhancing their keds with their own personal style using markers paints pens and other creative tools
1866350 this growing form of expression was the inspiration for keds studio through our relationship with zazzle we can now offer keds customers the opportunity to bring an uninhibited range of design options and a more professional design aesthetic to this classic shoe

1866357 we thought that open source could only work in software and now its being successfully applied to a product as mundane as a t shirt
1866358 i think naked amp angry if handled properly has the potential to be way bigger than threadless because we have the flexibility to do everything
1866359 to say its just a t shirt company is absurd
1866360 i look at it as a community company that happens to use t shirts as a canvas
1866361 threadless is one of the first firms to systematically mine a community for designs but everything is moving in this direction

1866497 project 366 will resume when i get the desktop fixed but tonite its time for bed
1866498 theres a lot talk of being in the top 10 and making the countdown
1866499 if we win a race between now and the end of the year then our season will have been a success wiley x will be extremely happy pontiac will be happy and well be happy because it sets the pace for the level of competition well be able to provide next year if were in a position where we have the performance level we can make a lot of those so called contenders nervous theyre not only going to have to worry about winning that round but theyre going to have to compete against our team and were going to be at a level where we can be a thorn in their side
1866500 we won our first race at brainerd and our next to last win back in 2002 was at reading
1866501 i feel really comfortable when competing at those racetracks especially at reading because we have so many fans in that area its only two hours from our race shop
1866502 were trying to run better on a hot track weve run well on some good tracks so were working on a better hot track combination although we havent seen too much of that this summer when we have it bit us seattle second round where we shook the tires real hard brainerd will be a really nice race and play into our strong points going into reading though well have to work on that hot track combination and try to get it refined well see if that can help us through the next eight to 10 races and get us through the end of the year
1866503 the fact that we can be competitive over that long a period of time i mean ive been racing on the nhra circuit for 18 years and its incredible to have had that kind of success
1866504 right now were not having one of our best years but were building the foundation to be able to have a great year next season and beyond
1866505 were also continuing to build our relationship with the wiley x sunglass machine and pontiac and were putting it all together im confident that our best races are ahead of us we want to finish up the rest of the season strong some people say were going to make the top 10 some say were not going to make the top 10 to us we just want to win races and between now and the end of the year we want to go out and be in a position to win races right now were probably a hundredth of a second from being in that position which is a pretty good spot to be
1866506 jerry haas built it for us over the winter and its probably one of the better race cars ive ever had if not the best it 60 foots well it always goes straight it never shakes the tires maybe once this year has it shaken the tires and thats because we got out of control with it its been very predictable and very fast the problem for us is that weve had four different engine programs in the first half of the year and changing from one engine builder to the next has been kind of elusive for us weve settled in with richard maskin and dart and we feel like we have a lot of potential there its just a matter of adapting the car to the engines and then helping him develop a little more horsepower we have a good program thats giving him consistent data and its a matter of tuning it up and making it run im really excited probably more so than ive been all year because we have some direction and some consistency on the engine side right now we dont have the power to be the top eight qualifier but richard has been able to give it to us consistently and hes going to continue working on that program truthfully hes probably more motivated than anybody on our team and thats what you need you need people that want to excel and richards proven over the years that he can hes won a lot of championships both with us and jeg coughlin and other teams and thats where it comes from his never ending desire to win when youre partnered up with somebody like that and you have that kind of energy in your corner it builds momentum it builds excitement and i see nothing but good things coming theres a light at the end of the tunnel and its us coming out running strong

1866608 rabeprazole lansoprazole and omeprazole are all brandstrom core structure compounds
1866609 one of skill in this art may have considered lansoprazole a candidate for a lead compound in the search for anti ulcer compounds

1866632 orang orang di sana sungguh sangat perhatian terhadap masalah kebersihan
1866633 setiap orang punya tanggung jawab yang sama dalam masalah kebersihan
1866634 mereka misalnya sangat sensitive jika ada sesobek kecil sampah saja yang tergeletak di lantai mereka akan langsung memungutnya dan membuang ke tempat sampah
1866635 aku suka sekali karena tuanku selalu menggunakan aku setiap pagi dan petang
1866636 karena aku sangat gembira karena aku bisa membantu membersihkan gigi tuan putriku yang cantik itu
1866637 kenapa kamu tengah ayo ceritakan tempat tugasmu kami ingin mendengarnya
1866638 orang orang di tempatku tidak semua perhatian dalam masalah kebersihan aku lebih sering dibiarkan tak terpakai di kamar mandi sisa sisa pembungkus sampo atau sabun dibuang begitu saja di kamar mandi malah kadang kadang pembalut di buangnya di liang wc mereka sepertinya tidak sadar bahwa itu bisa membuat wc jadi mampet
1866639 anak anak itu kadang juga membiarkan jemuran pakaian mereka yang jatuh sampai menumpuk berhari hari setelah itu akan jadi barang yang tak terpakai lagi padahal ibunya membeli dengan harga yang tidak murah

1866649 kalo kabut itu uap air yang kerapatanya tinggi iya kan sa
1866650 sinar matahari lemah sehingga kabut bisa bertahan sebagai uap air padat
1866651 jadi kalo ada sinar matahari kerapatan kabut akan merenggang dan ia akan ke atas sebagai awan

1866828 he might say hes not worried about colin barnett as leader of the opposition but his decision to call the election so quickly shows hes that hes petrified of him hes petrified that if given the chance to present himself as a possible alternative that he could win the election
1866829 so hes made a strategic decision which i think is a strategic blunder

1866871 i have salty tear marks on my face crying over an ex of one year i mean seriously how long does this fricking take he has a new gf on a flight to paris as we speak note we were supposed to go to paris together seeing pictures of them on facebook makes me want to vomit and so my question is why do i still care about him why does it make me sick to think of him being with another girl why am i so terrified of losing him or maybe the better question is why cant i face the fact that ive already lost him
1866872 i just dont understand where all the love is supposed to go when its all over
1866873 she had it all how do i find closure to the future that will now never happen but why force yourself to forget the harder we try the worse itll get and soon enough youll realize youre comparing everyone else to that person inch by inch and it becomes an endless cycle of eternal nostalgia
1866874 that cycle can be unhealthy and sabotage future relationships im no expert but sometimes we all have to realize our exes belong in the past cherish the good memories smile and move on
1866875 being able to avoid an ex is key to getting over the relationship
1866876 if you can justify why the breakup is necessary i think it makes it easier on the other person
1866877 life hands us whatever breakups we need for the evolution of our consciousness
1866878 i still find myself googling the boy i fell for the summer i turned sixteen and the man with whom i first fell in love summer 04 who is now engaged and the guy from high school who broke up with me in a coffee shop
1866879 i think of them and catalog in my mind all the scenarios that would lead to our reunion a visit home for christmas he walks into the party our eyes lock etc i think of them because they are at once completely familiar and unknown i knew them once and maybe loved them we were physically close emotionally linked driven crazy with chemistry yet i dont know those men anymore
1866880 when we do fall in love completely and without reservation all the dust that still swirls around the old flames will settle and the air will clear
1866881 i am miserable this summer b c i am working on my thesis and probably wont graduate and probably failed the bar that i took last week that sucked ass

1866898 a ccording to the buddhist point of view nonattachment is exactly the opposite of separation you need two things in order to have attachment the thing youre attaching to and the person whos attaching in nonattachment on the other hand theres unity theres unity because theres nothing to attach to if you have unified with the whole universe theres nothing outside of you so the notion of attachment becomes absurd who will attach to what

1866945 we have been working closely with our local government and with this animal control facility for the past year and a half
1866946 and we are disappointed that neither our representatives nor any of the animal caring citizens of this parish were advised notified or informed of this action until after these procedures took place we have fielded scores of phone calls from concerned citizens and several veterinarians who feel that a different course of action was available several veterinarians informed us that corona viruses are highly treatable especially in adult dogs with very inexpensive anti diarrhea drugs and antibiotics
1866947 everyone who has contacted us and we have had communications from around the state and country believes that our local government could have taken an alternative non lethal approach to this problem we happen to agree with those sentiments
1866948 we fully intend to use this opportunity to educate our state legislators on the need to create and or appoint a shelter regulatory agency which is in place in other states such as texas
1866949 we met and there are some issues but it was a good meeting
1866950 i think what it will take is for manny to give and for oscar to give to get a deal done
1866951 what bob needs to do is talk to manny and i need to talk to oscar im going to talk to oscar face to face when he comes to los angeles next week but this was a good first step we had a very good a very cordial meeting we talked about a lot of things
1866952 we had a nice meeting a very productive meeting richard is going to talk further with oscar next week manny is going to beijing for some of the olympics and i will talk to him soon richard and i can make a deal but we are not the guys doing the fighting its going to be up to the fighters there will have to be movement on both sides hopefully there will be movement we want to make a deal richard and i whether it can be made or not i dont know it will take give and take on both sides like in any negotiation
1866953 i can say without any question none of that will be a problem weight or gloves
1866954 if both guys are willing to give bob and i have laid the foundation and the groundwork under which a deal can be done
1866955 antonio is still out there and hasnt been totally rejected by the de la hoya people
1866956 it came up but richard has to sit with oscar and see what he wants to do
1866957 i think he should go fight a rematch with paul williams
1866958 i just felt after the first inning that he had good command of his other three pitches and we decided to get rid of one
1866959 my goal was to get us deep in the game obviously we used every arm tuesday night i knew guys would be down kind of achy today and my goal was to get us in the seventh eighth inning with the lead
1866960 also noticed that minnesota won i wasnt thinking about it on the mound but before the game i saw they were going to close out seattle there and it was a big game for us and fortunately it worked out
1866961 he doubled up and he threw it there and i was fortunate to hit it and got good wood on it and it got out
1866962 with guys on base and two outs i wanted to make him go get something it was a hair up and he did what good hitters do hes got 500 some odd home runs for a reason
1866963 we were looking for things to celebrate on the calendar when we ran across vernal equinox we knew vernal as a boy and frankly we never thought he would amount to much coincidentally today is also the first day of spring
1866964 if ive learned anything in the past year its that i had previously had no idea what commitment and responsibility meant
1866965 he was very upset and took it very badly it was as if he gave up
1866966 i think it was the last straw for him and he was destroyed by it he is a fighter but obviously we fear the worst
1866967 saya berasa amat marah terhadap tentera kerana saya tidak tahu mengapa mereka melakukan perbuatan ini terhadap saya saya berharap mereka akan ditembak seperti mereka menembak saya

1866996 voranda how did it go with the pilots this afternoon
1866997 not very well im afraid at least two dozen pilots had appeared at my meeting half of them walked out
1866998 they absolutely refused to have anything to do with the rebellion
1866999 why cant they see the dangers of allowing the empire to exist
1867000 they are smugglers and pirates garm what did you expect these spacers are probably more concerned with profit than our cause
1867001 perhaps it is best that we limit our recruitment to pilots interested in the cause
1867002 i agree however i did manage to recruit at least five or six smugglers to the cause and another five had agreed to help whenever they were available
1867003 odd or not at least these pilots have agreed to help somewhat
1867004 what really matters is that we have finally commenced upon an organized rebellion against the empire
1867005 how long has it been since you last saw your friend
1867006 the one i had met at the hotel before we left
1867007 i should have known i thought i had detected a certain lack of camaraderie between you two did you dislike each other
1867008 there were times he could be well a little priggish one can only wonder what he thought of me
1867009 i thought so there had been a few of them on maldare just after the clone war but they did not remain very long
1867010 how long do we have until this ship reaches ord mantell
1867011 good inform me the minute we arrive and inform commander praji to send two companies of storm troopers to the shuttle bay
1867012 it might seem excessive to you captain but my senses tell me that senator dahlma is not alone on ord mantell she might be involved in a conspiracy
1867013 i shall be in my quarters and do not forget my orders captain as you know i do not tolerate incompetence
1867014 not bad for a whole nights work maybe i should give up smuggling and become a gambler huh
1867015 in fact if i keep this up ill end up winning enough money to build that shipyard ani and i have always talked about trust me leaving the smuggling business would not bo
1867016 uh someone a smuggler like set and me he um were
1867017 why would you and this ani be interested in building your own shipyard why not set
1867018 um well set you see well he has never i mean he
1867019 okay the thing is well set is ani his name is anakin anakin skywalker you see he used to be a
1867020 of course the hero with no fear that would explain the lightsaber aboard the ship
1867021 yeah well dont go calling him by that nickname he hates
1867022 we need to get back to the hotel and warn anakin and the senator
1867023 you should have seen him his eyes were bugged wide open and his throat slit he must have lost a lot of blood
1867024 paige honey must you go over the entire thing in such graphic details
1867025 and you say that the body was inside a locked apartment
1867026 i even had to orb phoebe and myself inside like i had told barbara we thought we heard voices from inside the apartment before we found the body i mean there was no way the killer could have gotten out without being seen by us unless
1867027 unless some supernatural force was involved only what demon or warlock would want this guy dead
1867028 uh dewolfe mann i uh ive heard of him i just didnt realize that he was you know
1867029 honey this is san francisco location of the biggest gay community in the world dewolfe manns sexual preference shouldnt have been that surprising maybe finding a heterosexual partner in this city
1867030 hasnt gay bashing been on the rise lately at least thats what ive heard and mann had never bothered to hide his homosexuality
1867031 gay bashing inside his apartment hmmm perhaps but such cases usually involve some kind of physical assault or beating there were no signs of a struggle inside mr manns apartment
1867032 but didnt some neighbor report a disturbance inside the apartment
1867033 actually a mrs patio had reported hearing someone banging on mr manns apartment door a woman she didnt say anything about a disturbance from inside
1867034 paige and i were the ones who were overheard by that neighbor last night
1867035 i think i had heard voices from inside his apartment before we found him one of them belonged to a woman i think but once paige and i orbed inside we only found wolfies body and no one else and in my premonition i saw a mans hand slit his throat
1867036 are you saying theres a supernatural connection to mr manns death
1867037 how else can you explain voices from behind a closed door and just before we found his body
1867038 and im afraid that we cant disclose any information without the departments authorization at the moment or without ms manns
1867039 but as mr manns employer surely i have a right
1867040 jason please accept the fact that we cannot tell you everything youll just have to wait until we make our knowledge public like everyone else
1867041 we have a few questions to ask you about mr mann is there a time when youll be available
1867042 what can i tell you mann was a columnist and im the papers publisher i usually dont deal with my writers
1867043 i understand that you tend to be a hands on publisher you know deal with your staff personally
1867044 actually both he and ms mann had informed us about mr deans direct involvement in the papers editorial process
1867045 which apparently had led to clashes between you and mr mann so much so that according to his attorney mr turner he had made plans to leave this paper
1867046 what i meant was mann wouldnt have been able to leave just like that he had a five year contract and had only been with the bay mirror for three years
1867047 but according to mr turner mr mann was only obliged to work for three years after that he had the option to leave if and when he wanted apparently mr mann had been approached by the chronicle
1867048 we understand phoe ms halliwell we simply have to explore all possibilities in this investigation
1867049 and id like to add my thanks mr dean for your cooperation
1867050 so far jason is the only one who seems like a potential suspect
1867051 and i bet that cole was more than happy to give you that little information about jason and wolfie
1867052 actually he only told us about the contract and the job offer it was deborah mann who told us about the bad blood between mann and jason
1867053 however we well i was wondering if you and paige would return to manns apartment see if you can get a premonition of his killer
1867054 are you kidding how in the hell do you expect us to explain that we solved the case using magic especially if this comes to trial
1867055 look darryl im sure that well find a way its just well havent you noticed something odd about this case the body was found in a locked room and phoebe heard voices including a womans voice before she and paige had orbed inside the apartment i dont know about you but i find that very odd
1867056 but it was a man who had killed wolfie at least a masculine hand
1867057 right look if phoebe can find out who did it all we have to do is collect the evidence to convict him
1867058 instead of arresting him we might have to vanquish him
1867059 great whatever happened to the good old days of a simple homicide
1867060 anything that will get me out of this dreadful place i hope
1867061 a position as food columnist for the san francisco bay mirror dewolfe manns old job is being offered and you can apply for it on monday
1867062 tomorrow is saturday manns editor probably wont be there until monday
1867063 finally i was beginning to fear that i would be stuck here forever
1867064 oh please do not take my words personally i am simply not used to such cramped living conditions i need a bigger place to stay like a hotel suite
1867065 ive decided to stay here during the remainder of my stay in san francisco
1867066 are you how in the hell do you expect me to pay for a room at the omni its one of the citys most exclusive hotels
1867067 for heavens sake i will deal with the payment now pick up my bags and well check in
1867068 once weve checked in we will do a little shopping and come monday i will go to the offices of this bay mirror it shouldnt be a problem and within a few days bruce mcneill will be dead and you will have your witch
1867069 i am retired master darklighter i used to be a diplomat a trade emissary between my homeworld and coruscant
1867070 from ghorman i had retired from diplomatic service and settled here on tatooine some ten years ago
1867071 im afraid that it was not a matter of choice i its personal
1867072 it must be very frustrating for you to be so far from the center of the empire
1867073 of course i personally consider that beneficial if you must know i am not a fan of the empire
1867074 that business on ghorman we dont need such things here on tatooine which is why i am grateful that the imperial presence
1867075 yes well that particular business had been difficult for many of us a cousin of mine had protested the actions of the imperials needless to say nearly everyone in our family
1867076 it must be hard living on tatooine all these years
1867077 biggs and me like to fly sometimes we go racing through beggars canyon in t 16 skyhoppers
1867078 both of us plan to join the imperial academy to become pilots
1867079 but we can really learn to fly as imperial pilots first
1867080 i dont see why anyone would want to join the imperial academy in the first place the military seems only interested in making war upon others
1867081 leia this is not the time or place for political talk
1867082 let the young lady talk owen after all the empire is not exactly popular with the citizens of tatooine i certainly dont care for it in fact
1867083 i still cannot understand my sons desire to become an imperial officer
1867084 because it would help luke and me become better pilots father
1867085 i can think of a better future for you young man than getting involved with the imperials
1867086 you and the senators aide plan to have dinner here in the hotel
1867087 nope i have something better in mind you and chewie try to stay out of trouble
1867088 hey im not the one who fought it out with a bunch of street scum remember
1867089 pardon me sir but i need to speak with you
1867090 im sorry i thought you were someone i once knew
1867091 do you are you sharing this room with someone else
1867092 and here he is hey chewie what took you so long
1867093 no i guess not pardon me for wasting your time my mistake
1867094 no one just someone with a case of mistaken identity
1867095 what in the blazes are you doing here of all places
1867096 no i mean here on ord mantell what are you doing here this system is mainly a haven for smugglers
1867097 oh of course i had learned from obi wan that you had become a smuggler
1867098 i had seen him about several days ago and nine years before our last meeting he told me about your new vocation
1867099 from a former passenger of yours a senator solipo yeb i believe that you had helped him escape from corellia some
1867100 yes i remember i had no idea that obi wan had been keeping an eye on me
1867101 he had tried looking for you during the jedi purge
1867102 but to no avail right now he is living on
1867103 to be honest obi wan and i had parted on bad terms you must know why
1867104 quite simple i had betrayed the order by becoming the emperors apprentice a sith apprentice it happened during the last days of the war
1867105 rather odd coming from you didnt you once tell obi wan that it was dangerous for me to be a part of the order
1867106 lets just say that i had overheard a conversation between you two quite by accident not long before you had left the order
1867107 i dont believe it in fact its impossible romulus wort became lord sidious new apprentice after the war after dookus death
1867108 you mean after me i became the emperors apprentice not long after dookus death in fact during the beginning of the purge i was the one who led the attack on the temple i had also killed the separatist leaders on mustafar where obi wan also caught up with me we dueled and
1867109 i had a vision through the force of my future life as darth vader so i left i left obi wan on mustafar and i turned my back on the emperor which is how i started a new career as a smuggler
1867110 so youre just going to sit there and pretend that you did nothing wrong do you think you can simply turn your back on your crimes and pretend all is well with the universe
1867111 dont worry ferus ive been suffering the consequences of my actions for the past decade and im quite certain that ill continue to pay for years to come
1867112 unless you want to punish me now strike me down with the weapon you still carry
1867113 and what give in to the dark side as you did
1867114 become the emperors new apprentice i would never even consi
1867115 its been at least four or five years since i was last in his presence
1867116 i have occasionally served as an agent on the emperors behalf
1867117 i had received a personal message from the emperor that two of my friends including my former partner roan lands had been arrested by the bellassan government the emperor asked me to search for a rebel saboteur on samaria in exchange for their release and amnesty i had no choice but to accept
1867118 i told a few friends about roans capture and they managed to free him and dona telamark and they went to bellassa to free them i went to samaria to find the saboteur she turned out to be an old friend of obi wan and i helped both her and her son to escape from the imperials both roan and dona were rescued by friends and they met me on samaria however romulus i mean lord rasche and several stormtroopers appeared i had remained behind to delay them so that my friends could escape
1867119 i also found myself acting as a double agent for both the imperials and the samarian rebels i thought i could help the rebellion in this manner but it all ended badly
1867120 roan is dead and my other friends began to consider me as a traitor
1867121 i thought your friend roan had managed to escape how did he
1867122 did you say that you two had fought together during the clone wars
1867123 both petre and my mother were from the chommell system it had been wracked by constant invasion attempts by the separatists

1867261 if this is true for man may it not also be true for god is it not also the case that the worth and excellency of gods soul is to be measured by the object of his love
1867262 we need to see first and foremost that god is god that he is perfect and complete in himself that he is overflowingly happy in the eternal fellowship of the trinity and that he does not need us to complete his fullness and is not deficient without us rather we are deficient without him the all sufficient glory of god freely given in fellowship through his sacrificed son is the stream of living water that we have thirsted for all our lives unless we begin with god in this way when the gospel comes to us we will inevitably put ourselves at the center of it we will feel our value rather than gods value is the driving force in the gospel we will trace the gospel back to gods need for us instead of tracing it back to the sovereign grace that rescues sinners who need god but the gospel is the good news that god is the all satisfying end of all our longings and that even though he does not need us and is in fact estranged from us because of our god belittling sins he has in the great love with which he loved us made a way for sinners to drink at the river of his delights through jesus christ and we will not be enthralled by this good news unless we feel that he was not obligated to do this he was not coerced or constrained by our value he is the center of the gospel the exaltation of his glory is the driving force of the gospel the gospel is a gospel of grace and grace is the pleasure of god to magnify the worth of god by giving sinners the right and power to delight in god without obscuring the glory of god

1867265 julio supone ya el decimocuarto mes en el que el desempleo se incrementa de manera consecutiva dicho con otras palabras ya se cumple m s de un a o desde el que el incremento interanual del paro no cesa de aumentar adem s cada vez con un
1867266 quinto peor dato del a o bastante en l nea con lo que sucedi en junio
1867267 por sectores y aplicando el m todo anterior vemos que la explicaci n m s com n en los medios de comunicaci n del aumento del paro no es del todo cierta la construcci n ya no es el principal responsable ya que su ritmo de crecimiento se est estancando e incluso cayendo
1867268 casi de la mitad del aumento del paro de este mes aportan el 49 por ciento de los nuevos parados respecto a mayo de 2007
1867269 llamativo el incremento del paro intermensual de este sector en un mes de julio 0 9 por ciento cuando estacionalmente es el sector que mejor se comporta en dicho mes no obstante es cierto que los servicios siguen creando empleo pero a ritmos de crecimiento insuficientes 1 6 por ciento para absorber la oferta de trabajadores sin que aumente al paro
1867270 paro se reduce por el repunte de las contrataciones propias de los meses estivales esto no s lo no sucede en este a o sino que la cuant a de los incrementos es preocupante
1867271 si el paro aumentara a partir de agosto tanto como lo hizo el a o pasado 160 000
1867272 especialmente bueno para dicho sector por el repunte de las contrataciones estivales cuyos ritmos de crecimiento en a os anteriores fueron del 3 3 por ciento en julio de 2007 y del 5 por ciento en julio de 2006
1867273 entre julio de 2007 y junio de 2008 el desempleo ya ha supuesto 2 770 millones de euros m s que en el mismo per odo del a o anterior y de continuar al actual ritmo de crecimiento ascender a a 4 600 millones m s

1867311 i believe innovation comes from crossing boundaries the first time i did such a cross was five years ago when i took the leap from molecular biology to bioinformatics and computer science following this transition i learned new ways of doing research by learning to deal with larger datasets that can only be handled using computers but also i realized that the same principle governs both fields being able to find answers by searching information in the best way possible this in particular is what google started out doing and still does but now provides besides its ranking of web pages new tools that help us re wire the web having used the mashup editor the reader to aggregate and share blog content and also seen the potential of the documents application for moving the desktop on the web i decided instead of simply being a user to become a contributor i am determined to use my software and technical skills to play a part in the development of these tools or any other innovative projects currently happening at google i am ready to cross the boundaries once again and use the lessons from years of scientific research in working for a company that evolves the web providing users with the tools to make it a richer information medium

1867330 ka mi tidak akan menyetujui adanya pltn di cilegon kalau di banten saya kira cocok dibangun di kabupaten lebak karena kalau di cilegon kan sudah banyak pembangkit listrik
1867331 kata nuklir itu yang nantinya dapat meresahkan masyarakat pasti masyarakat akan protes jika ada pltn pokoknya pemkot cilegon tidak setuju adanya pltn
1867332 alasannya daerah bojonegara itu dialokasikan untuk kawasan ekonomi khusus kek sedangkan pulau panjang juga direncanakan untuk kilang minyak
1867333 kini pemerintah lebih condong kepada bagaimana membuat udara di cilegon ini lebih kondusif sudah cukup dengan pembangkit pembangkit dan deretan perindustrian kalau ada pltn sudah nantinya udara kotor kami khawatir menjadi malapetaka bagi permukiman masyarakat dan kawasan industri yang sudah nampak padat saya takut ada ledakan nuklir seperti beberapa kejadian di negara lain
1867334 kalau ada masyarakat yang menolak terhadap rencana pembangunan pltn itu terlalu dini masih harus dikaji jika rencana itu nantinya sudah positif langkah pertama yang dilakukan adalah sosialisasi kepada masyarakat sehingga tidak terjadi kesalahan dalam mengartikan kata nuklir
1867335 lahan untuk pembangunan pltn itu diperkirakan mencapai 500 hektare namun kami menunggu kajian dari batan para ahli yang bekerja di batan menjamin bahwa pembangunan pltn akan aman dan tidak membahayakan masyarakat dan alam pembangunan pltn diproteksi sedemikian rupa sehingga tidak terjadi hal hal yang tidak diinginkan
1867336 kami tentu perlu mengetahui secara pasti bagaimana dampak dari pembangunan pltn itu terhadap alam termasuk terhadap masyarakat nantinya akan dilakukan ekspos setelah kajian itu dilakukan sehingga baik pemerintah daerah maupun masyarakat bisa mengetahui secara pasti dampak dari keberadaan pltn
1867337 kawasan bojonegara memang sudah diperuntukkan untuk kawasan industri berat kimia dan industri galangan kapal jika memang pembangunan pltn dimungkinkan di wilayah bojonegara saya kira tidak jadi persoalan
1867338 ide ini tidak diterima industri karena pengaruh perusahaan perusahaan minyak yang masih sangat kuat

1867409 beware the leader who bangs the drum of war in order to whip the the citizenry into a patriotic freyor for patriotism is a double edged sword it both emboldens the blood just as it narrows the mind and when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry rather the citizenry infused with fear and blinded by patriotism will offer up all of their rights and gladly so how do i know for this is what i have done and i am julius caesar

1867504 children are at the vanguard of the social networking phenomenon
1867505 what you find with young people is that they tend to be a lot looser with their personal information than more canny older people
1867506 that can be ok if they are in a fairly tightly controlled environment but when they are in an environment where theyre mixing with people much older than them then thats something to be quite cautious about

1867510 what we think of as a computer and what we think of as it in general is likely to change
1867511 the intelligent systems will move from being information systems to intelligent systems that will carry out a whole variety of tasks that we just wont think of as computing tasks the technology will find its way into so many things we do and we wont even think about it the explicit way weve done computing in the past will be there but it will be a very small subset of what well be doing
1867512 when you think back on where we were decades ago computers were still things that largely sat in big rooms behind big windows and were attended to by computing gurus or priests
1867513 in the 40 years weve just completely changed the way people think about computers and computing its gone from a very expensive very exclusive kind of technology to something that is unquestionably ubiquitous from the computers on our desks to the computers in our cell phones
1867514 when you see how intense the reaction is to things like the iphone with its use of touch and its sensitivity to motion you begin to get a sense of gee if machines understand the physical world and were capable of reacting to our voices to our movements and gestures and touch how much closer would we feel to them
1867515 at the same time of course we would like the ability to become more a part of these artificial or virtual worlds that are created entirely within the machine were starting to see with things like lively from google the ability of these machines to create these worlds that are much more comfortable for us to experience and be a part of
1867516 you can imagine a future where in fact not just our very senses will be engaged but our thoughts will drive machine behavior
1867517 you can see how that boundary starts to soften and begins to blur theres no question in my mind that the technology will bring these two unique and distinct forms of intelligence together
1867518 any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful if we get something wrong you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species
1867519 we want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that we will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well the changes will be faster and more profound than the very very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution
1867520 maybe it will take eight years or 200 years it is very hard to predict
1867521 the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots
1867522 there will be no distinction post singularity between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality
1867523 our brains are a million times slower than electronics we will increasingly become software entities if you go out enough decades
1867524 nanotechnology will not just be used to reprogram but to transcend biology and go beyond its limitations by merging with non biological systems if we rebuild biological systems with nanotechnology we can go beyond its limits
1867525 a more intelligent process will inherently outcompete one that is less intelligent making intelligence the most powerful force in the universe
1867526 i think there are grave dangers technology has always been a double edged sword
1867527 i think that if we are right this could extend life span by 5 or 10 percent
1867528 it would necessitate changing ideas about when people retire and when they stop paying into the system

1867535 theres a much greater chance of a drug that can treat disease than of extending life span

1867577 im accepting the policy as it applies to me because i knew it was in place and i dont expect anyone to make any exceptions
1867578 but in the long run i think the policy is not a good one because in a sense its saying that wheatons standards are higher than gods thats an upside down world
1867579 too often the solution has been how do we take what we have and reconfigure it pretty up our programs to make them more attractive the true missions enterprise as found in scripture has never been about attracting people and bringing them to a building the early church didnt even have buildings
1867580 jesus christ never said we should go out and invite people to come to a meeting instead he was attracting them to an incarnational lifestyle he was living out among them who god was and he them to live out that lifestyle wherever they went being a christian in the first century wa not about joining a social club like it has become today
1867581 i think a big problem with reaching the lost world is that we project the image that to be a christian new believers must come and be with us and act like us we should spend less time trying to get them to adapt to our evangelical subculture and more time helping them live out incarnational lifestyle among their unchurched friends
1867582 today most of our evangelism efforts center around inviting people to church to hear the gospel in reality all missions and evangelism should occur primarily in the community outside the walls of the church
1867583 we have to rethink how we do church our ecclesiology our doctrine has to flow out of our missiology we need to go back to scripture and determine what church is really about its not about buildings and budgets and programs though those are good it is about being a missionary people and equipping them to be missionary whether or not they are funded

1867660 its time to start calling anatomical organs by their anatomical name we should be proud of our bodies
1867661 im hoping that the use of this new word is part of the objection to only saying vagina since it doesnt include all of womens genitalia for instance the clitoris in the way that vulva does
1867662 the reason that vajayjay has caught on i think is because there is a black southern especially naming tradition which is to have names like ray ray and boo boo and things like that
1867663 it sounds warm and familiar and it almost makes the vagina feel like a little cartoon character with eyes that walks around
1867664 a very elegant middle aged black woman used that word in my presence last week
1867665 the stuff of thought language as a window into human nature

1867670 now wed once used the word penis 17 times in a single episode and no one blinked but with vagina the good folks at broadcast standards and practices blinked over and over and over i think no one is comfortable experiencing the female anatomy out loud which is a shame considering our anatomy is half the population

1867815 i am the one who broke into mrs wayburnes house
1867816 mr stone did you break into mrs wayburnes home last night
1867817 tell me mac what happened i mean what time did you break in did you think anyone was home or what
1867818 i broke in about two in the morning and no i didnt think anyone was home if i thought someone was there i wouldnt have broken in as far as what happened mrs wayburne is what happened
1867819 well mac lets try this another way tell me what transpired from the time you broke in until the time you left
1867820 detective i broke in through the backdoor breaking the pane of the kitchen door i unlocked the door had two black duffel bags and a flashlight with me and inside my coat a smith and wesson 38 pistol in a shoulder holster
1867821 believe me or not when i walked in i noticed someone had left all the eyes on the stove on but no flames so the house smelled of gas the first thing i did was cut off the eyes
1867822 yeah she said how are you doing young man may i help you i was so lost and confused i didnt know what to say so i apologized to her and told her i didnt know it was her who lived here
1867823 she told me does it make a difference whether i live here or someone else you know another black person someone who looks like you live here and what you are doing is wrong she was right and believe it or not detective i felt so damn small and the only thing i could do was apologize again and ask her for her forgiveness and then the darnedest thing happened
1867824 i have known her all my life we used to live directly across the street from her when i was young and she was also my sixth and ninth grade teacher additionally she taught me how to play the piano
1867825 we sat and drank tea and she chastised me in a way i have never been chastised before it was subtle but very effective she told me about our history her history and in a lot of ways about my history i told her how i felt when my mother died and why i do what i do she didnt know me but she explained me to me detective hilliard i went there to rob her of her valuables but instead she robbed me she took away the guilt i had been feeling ever since my mother died and she did it by teaching me about the history of black folks she did it by thoroughly explaining to me what it meant to be a freedom rider to march on the nations capital to be sprayed by high power water hoses to be attacked by dogs to be beaten for sitting at a lunch counter to be denied the right to drink at a public fountain or ride in the front of the bus she taught me detective for three hours we talked and talked and talked
1867826 mac you didnt kill mrs wayburne she died in her sleep knowing maggie wayburne like i do i think she was lonely and tired of living i think she wanted to be with her loved ones you probably saved her from committing suicide but you gave her something before she died
1867827 you made her remember her purpose in life she died knowing she had saved another life she died making a difference she died with a quiet heart the same way she lived
1867828 i was walking by mr teddys house when i thought i would just pop in for a visit i noticed his study light was on and i decided to peek in from the outside to see if he was in there there was frost on the window so i had to wipe it away to see inside that is when i saw his body so i kicked in the front door to confirm my suspicions of foul play i called the police immediately afterward

1867830 for years since the creation of the bureau agents have sometimes been victims themselves of random crimes or murder sprees every so often we at the bureau have come to expect that we will be the victims of someones random acts of hatred and discord and even though we may expect it reality always hits us by surprise but we deal with it
1867831 deep in the piles of unsolved fbi crimes is a case that many of us wish we could be the ones to solve it in a case that began in 1982 a total of twenty one agents were murdered agents were killed on stakeouts in their cars at stores jogging and yes at home though we committed unlimited resources to the case we never found out who was responsible no person or group took credit for the crimes as fast as it began the murder spree stopped it lasted three months
1867832 in 1993 similar crimes against former and present agents began
1867833 we studied every piece of correspondence that came in if it was a phone call we checked the voice properties a thousand and one times we tracked e mails which was a fairly new entity back then had handwriting experts check out all hand written correspondence and broke down every inch of typed communiqu we could tell you if it came from a typewriter or computer as well as what kind of typewriter computer and printer
1867834 over two months had passed since the killings in richmond and berkeley
1867835 we put together a dedicated team of forensics technicians to go back and check out all of the correspondence we had received the more we checked the more letters we found

1867994 has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1867995 the majority opinion reads as if there wasnt any expectation that the u s would comply with the icjs judgment
1867996 it doesnt put the u s in a good light particularly because the executive branch tried to convey the opposite message
1867997 it looks like the total population growth in harris county last year was dominated by the hispanic population and thats the really overriding story
1867998 it more than offset a small decline in the non hispanic white population and there were relatively small increases in the asian and black populations
1867999 the new census figures are close to what many of us in harris county expected
1868000 while this growth is strong it remains well within our abilities to continue to provide the services necessary to support and sustain it
1868001 it shows largely the continuation of important recent trends which is that texas is a state that is leading the nation in its ethnic and racial changes
1868002 there are a large number of counties in the state that are majority minority and the proportion of minorities in the state continues to increase
1868003 there is by no means the kind of stagnation you see in east coast cities that have become majority minority
1868004 harris county continues to function well in the face of rapid changes in its population the economy continues to be among the most dynamic in terms of job creation in the country
1868005 thats the age when youre making families and making babies
1868006 there is nothing in the world to prevent houston from being more multiethnic more latino and less anglo
1868007 they are coming here from other parts of the country because houston continues to have jobs in factories and food processing for nannies and day care workers but above all in construction and the hospitality industries restaurants and hotels
1868008 anglo population numbers in harris county are declining because of suburbanization in essence out migration to counties like montgomery fort bend and to galveston and brazoria
1868009 there are new companies moving in and we have company re locations from harris county to these piney woods of montgomery county

1868013 to go to church i try to get a ride from somebody forget going to the grocery store
1868014 metro said there was low ridership but many people out here now have to walk to get to where they need to go
1868015 that kind of crosstown trip is difficult in houston because the radial flow on the major roadways leads to downtown
1868016 when you look at airport blvd airport would be a nice logical route except the road doesnt go all the way through
1868017 the streets make it very difficult for us to operate buses this is not because of metro

1868054 todays verdict does little if anything to advance american security the entire process raises fundamental questions about the administrations disregard for our constitutional values and may well do america more harm than good in the court of world opinion it took seven years for the bush administrations military commissions system to get its first conviction for a crime that is regularly prosecuted in federal court and when it did it was a driver who even the administration acknowledges did not participate in the planning or execution of any terrorist attacks surely there is a better way to protect america and bring terrorists to justice while adhering to the constitutional values that have kept us safe and strong for 200 years

1868060 people always ask me do you play golf because a majority of sportsmen do i used to play quite a few years ago but to be honest id rather spend 4 hours with the kids than 4 hours on a golf course as much as it can be relaxing its a frustrating sport my way of relaxing is listening to music and spending time with the kids
1868061 im a really bad loser it stays with me for a while i always take it quite personally when we dont win as a team or i dont win in everything else i do

1868361 the national assembly for wales has at its core a commitment to transparent and accessible democracy
1868362 i am proud to chair a panel that will report to the assembly commission on the best way of providing support to assembly members that is appropriate for wales and that will help underpin future good governance and effective public service in wales
1868363 from our point of view taxpayers are under a lot of pressure at the moment given the record tax take and the current economic conditions
1868364 people are very concerned that our elected representatives are in some cases squandering our money and at the very worse helping themselves to money theyre not entitled to
1868365 the best way to restore the publics faith and dispel those concerns is to make the system 100 transparent by publishing all expenses claims and receipts for everyone to see
1868366 the independent review panel has therefore been tasked to produce a set of evidence based recommendations containing principles that will deliver a fair equitable and transparent process for the financial support of assembly members in order to improve public knowledge and perception of these issues

1868369 we cant even acknowledge if a youth is in our system
1868370 when i saw it on the auction site i didnt think the guys would go for it
1868371 another guy saw it and was fired up about it so i thought maybe we would be able to sell it to the group and we did
1868372 the owners of the lake acquire a lot of cool stuff for it
1868373 as far as we know this is going to be the only divable c 130 in the u s so its a big deal
1868374 we had to cut it up in little pieces to get it down here
1868375 those wings are in four sections and we had to scab them together and we had to cut holes to make it safe inside we have a lot of people helping us here
1868376 we have a world class premier diving site right here and the people in this community should really learn how to dive and take advantage of something like this
1868377 i was ready for him to be gone months ago
1868378 as far as im concerned things happened that would lead anyone to believe their job would be in jeopardy
1868379 when he was hired i asked him to remove politics at city hall
1868380 i only talked to one person and the exact opposite of that has happened
1868381 you can find out what happens next monday night at the next council meeting
1868382 i have had no meetings about them becoming city manager
1868383 i know those men and i talk with chief pynes regularly but i have had no meetings about them taking over
1868384 i havent talked to any council members and nothing has ever come up about it
1868385 i just got off the phone with him and he didnt say what it was for
1868386 but he blew it out of proportion with his assumptions its politics and thats the opposite of what i want at city hall weve had that in the past and i dont want it
1868387 when youre on city time i want you to be neutral
1868388 if you have the mesh backpacks everything falls out because they get holes in them really easy
1868389 even if you have a clear backpack you can still put stuff inside other things to put in your clear bag i guess they realized it wasnt doing much
1868390 at the high school level youve got kids in band athletics and dance who are carrying three or four types of different bags for various things
1868391 those arent covered under the rules theyre not clear and it was hard to get consistency and uniformity so it just works for us not to have that rule
1868392 ive never worn them but it seems that kids slip all the time just wearing regular shoes so its definitely a hazard when you throw a wheel in there
1868393 dress codes are really about safety not only because of hazards but because it helps show who is supposed to be on campus and whos not
1868394 a recommendation came from our campus administrators that they didnt see any need for it
1868395 they felt that security was good and thought it would be easier on the kids and the families to not have to go that route with the recommendation and because they know the campus atmosphere we took their advice
1868396 everybodys made such a big deal out of a shirttail so we thought wed try to do something about it that still had some structure
1868397 were not going to let them have the big jerseys where they can hide stuff underneath and look tacky we want this to be a good learning environment and we expect them to learn the guidelines so that when they go out into their career they know how to handle a dress code
1868398 i think theyre trying to loosen up the rules so it might motivate the students to do better in their grades
1868399 it will be kind of a compromise and balance for students to get them to focus on their classes and try to get up their taks scores instead of worrying about stuff like that
1868400 our school is pretty flexible as far as color but shirt tucking is one of our big things here
1868401 some of the cute little tops girls wear that hit just above the hips are too short to be tucked in but were working closely with principals to be consistent particularly at the secondary level
1868402 the majority of our kids are great and comply to whatever the rules might be
1868403 but just like discipline rules code of conduct or any other rules at a large school youre going to have a few violations and that takes time away from instruction and other things
1868404 wed have to go back and check plats my people dont have time to check on that
1868405 first i heard about it was when i walked into the courtroom that morning
1868406 i just want to make sure peoples rights are respected on both sides of the coin

1868410 theyve only written them down by lets say five or 6 total over the past few quarters
1868411 we are confident the actions we are taking are strengthening freddie macs financial and competitive position as well as its ability to serve the american homebuyer and will generate value well into the future
1868412 by the end of the third quarter the preferred stock in fannie and freddie will be issued the treasury will have bought it
1868413 well be on our way toward a joint treasury agency combination
1868414 i think hes an extraordinarily talented manager particularly on the fixed income side but based on the information i have now i do not believe that the treasury will end up having to inject money into freddie mac
1868415 i dont see how they can raise capital by themselves without a capital infusion from treasury
1868416 most of the earnings in futures years will go the preferred holders bond holders and the treasury not the common stockholder
1868417 mortgage rates have to come down or this economy is going nowhere
1868418 obama and mccain are both talking fiction when it comes to balancing the budget in their term the deficit which is now approaching 500 billion in my way of thinking will grow to 600 billion and then 700 billion because thats required in a period where slow growth persists
1868419 we need people on the fed that understand interest rate spreads and credit spreads and the dynamics of the market place not just academics

1868427 dan sungguh akan kami berikan cobaan kepadamu dengan sedikit ketakutan kelaparan kekurangan harta jiwa dan buah buahan dan berikanlah berita gembira kepada orang orang yang sabar
1868428 apakah kamu mengira bahwa kamu akan masuk surga padahal belum nyata bagi allah orang orang yang berjihad diantaramu dan belum nyata orang orang yang sabar

1868441 white leaf disease is often compared to cancer or hiv virus in human you never know if or when you will contract it until it is often too late

1868448 people still werent getting more money in their pockets at the same time costs were going up so it was harder to save harder to retire which meant people were maxing out on their credit cards they were taking out home equity loans to pay off bills
1868449 we need to crack down on those who have abused our credit market and caused this housing decline
1868450 and we need to take action to support american businesses so that we stop jobs from going overseas and create more jobs here at home
1868451 contracted partly because the federal government did not oversee the lending process as effectively as it should have
1868452 they think that theyre better off today than they were four or eight years ago do they think that the economy is working right now
1868453 if they do then they should work their heart out for john mccain because his policies are not different from what george bush has been offering
1868454 there is considerable marketplace interest in the gametap business and brand we are considering various strategic options but have reached no final agreement as yet when there is a resolution we will announce it
1868455 its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many license holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the license to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees

1868460 painstaking investigation led us to the conclusion that dr bruce e ivins was responsible for the death sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailing and that it appears based on the evidence that he was acting alone
1868461 gardy and i go way back and one thing we have never done is lie to one another
1868462 i never could hit him so im glad hes on my side
1868463 hes one of those guys who really locates his pitches and you dont know how many he has he seems to keep making them up
1868464 hes a triple threat he also can field his position and he can hit
1868465 hes like the pudgy guy who shows up at the company picnic everybody is laughing and then he walks away with all the trophies
1868466 even in hitters counts he will throw breaking balls or changeups hes always confident that even if he walks you he will get the next guy out he is always adjusting always doing something different to be successful
1868467 he can go deep into the game and give your staff a lift
1868468 hes a great competitor weve had to face him and try to deal with him now we get to see him do that to arizona and los angeles
1868469 we have reports of 25 militants two paramilitary soldiers were also killed and three wounded

1868481 to be sure the poor and middle class are being hurt more but upper crust thriftiness could reverberate across the rest of the economy
1868482 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
1868483 many are asking their personal shoppers and private jet providers to seek the best deals rather than over the top extravagances
1868484 he also may buy a hybrid to supplement the two mercedes in his heated four car garage
1868485 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
1868486 its not like the state helps us sell our houses or helps our spouses find a new job
1868487 theyre trying to compare us to other law enforcement agencies that dont have the same function and responsibilities that we do
1868488 it looks like the total population growth in harris county last year was dominated by the hispanic population and thats the really overriding story
1868489 it more than offset a small decline in the non hispanic white population and there were relatively small increases in the asian and black populations
1868490 the new census figures are close to what many of us in harris county expected
1868491 while this growth is strong it remains well within our abilities to continue to provide the services necessary to support and sustain it
1868492 it shows largely the continuation of important recent trends which is that texas is a state that is leading the nation in its ethnic and racial changes
1868493 there are a large number of counties in the state that are majority minority and the proportion of minorities in the state continues to increase
1868494 there is by no means the kind of stagnation you see in east coast cities that have become majority minority
1868495 harris county continues to function well in the face of rapid changes in its population the economy continues to be among the most dynamic in terms of job creation in the country
1868496 thats the age when youre making families and making babies
1868497 there is nothing in the world to prevent houston from being more multiethnic more latino and less anglo
1868498 they are coming here from other parts of the country because houston continues to have jobs in factories and food processing for nannies and day care workers but above all in construction and the hospitality industries restaurants and hotels
1868499 anglo population numbers in harris county are declining because of suburbanization in essence out migration to counties like montgomery fort bend and to galveston and brazoria
1868500 there are new companies moving in and we have company re locations from harris county to these piney woods of montgomery county
1868501 i did it again because i had to cover the debt
1868502 i think for the first time our justice system worked
1868503 i was very disappointed in houston because we were ready to help
1868504 it wasnt until two weeks later that the attorneys got a notice the bond fund was available we only had one person who was still being detained and whose family couldnt raise the bail money
1868505 within 24 hours ice decided to take them to the detention centers in texas just to facilitate removing them as fast as possible i thought that was unfair
1868506 if they stayed in massachusetts close to where we could have bonded them out they could have gotten due process
1868507 one of his big themes was that the immigration story in the united states is vital to the health and growth of our country
1868508 i know many many many latin americans including many many mexicans so i have a personal friendship a personal affinity
1868509 these contributors better be prepared to lose a lot of money
1868510 theres one more reason besides humanitarian that this bond fund was created and its just as important its political
1868511 we hope that if we get a lot of history helping people in raids plus a lot of contributions even if its only a buck then we can really have a voice next year in the immigration debate
1868512 we were able to find a family a pro bono lawyer and convince a judge to let us post a 4 000 bond to get him out of jail and into a permanent situation
1868513 when the 4 000 comes back were going to offer that as a scholarship fund for him
1868514 as good as we are as many gains as weve made were not where we need to be yet
1868515 we need to be sending a message to the world that we want to build nuclear plants here
1868516 let those people over there at the capitol make the decision
1868517 the lights are going to stay on but at a very expensive price
1868518 compared to students in other countries the numbers are downright frightening
1868519 employers all across this state have told us in clear and forceful terms that if we are to compete successfully we must increase significantly the number of qualified skilled and trainable workers
1868520 the business community is extremely concerned about both the quality and quantity of high school graduates in order to meet the future work force needs of texas both will have to increase dramatically
1868521 all of our hope is that we will start graduating enough people out of the academy so thomas can fill his patrol division and this will become a moot point
1868522 but absent that i think it will be difficult for the sheriff to do any new contracts
1868523 without question we know as a matter of fact that mr cornyn was an obstructionist on the last debate on comprehensive immigration reform
1868524 he hasnt done anything in six years to help reform immigration
1868525 were worse off both as a state and as a country for not having comprehensive immigration reform we are less safe the border is not as secure as it should be
1868526 a realistic solution forcing the individuals already here to come out of the shadows
1868527 we are deeply concerned about this matter and are working with our patients to address their concerns and provide them with appropriate personal identity protection services
1868528 the county attorney needs to review obviously their entire record keeping system
1868529 has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1868530 the majority opinion reads as if there wasnt any expectation that the u s would comply with the icjs judgment
1868531 it doesnt put the u s in a good light particularly because the executive branch tried to convey the opposite message
1868532 the proceeds are for a good cause theres no question about that
1868533 i think they sponsors and participants are buying access and paying tribute to the speaker
1868534 the only folks i know that benefit from our event are the uninsured children of texas
1868535 our concern here is really about providing access to health care
1868536 advocate for private sector initiatives so it seemed to be a nice match
1868537 the money is going to the charity the point of the tournament is to raise money so that children can be immunized
1868538 susan carnaby does not want other people to suffer as she did through the death of her husband
1868539 only public outcry will change the policy so other people wont be put in danger the documents will show what they did and whether there is some excuse for what they did
1868540 there is no legitimate reason for susan carnabys alleged need to disclose this information to the public public disclosure of the information and documentation produced in this case could affect the ability of the parties to have a fair trial and the ability to seat a fair and impartial jury
1868541 i believe the public has a right to know the details of the investigation especially when the police department is investigating itself
1868542 i am sure my husband would have wanted as many of the actual circumstances as possible regarding his shooting by the houston police as well as the investigation by the houston police to be open and not hidden
1868543 the public information act doesnt apply to case discovery and protective orders and if you look at this in terms of the larger issue the information is relevant to public health and safety
1868544 there are other ways to get a fair trial rather than suppressing government information
1868545 a lot of people get stuck out here on sundays
1868546 to go to church i try to get a ride from somebody forget going to the grocery store
1868547 metro said there was low ridership but many people out here now have to walk to get to where they need to go
1868548 that kind of crosstown trip is difficult in houston because the radial flow on the major roadways leads to downtown
1868549 when you look at airport blvd airport would be a nice logical route except the road doesnt go all the way through
1868550 the streets make it very difficult for us to operate buses this is not because of metro
1868551 you know how you felt when you got your first rejection from a girl like wait what is wrong with me that makes you not like me and then you want her to like you even more not for who she is but because you need to validate that part of you that says im a good person and why would anyone dislike me
1868552 these are public monies so every expenditure of public money means that some other service cannot be rendered to the taxpayers
1868553 if youre gonna have kids that are outdoors young kids when theres fast moving water be vigilant because theres some real danger out there
1868554 he scares me when he yells at mom brittany or me i hide and protend that im not there
1868555 whenever dad yells and get mad mom cries and gets upset alot and sometimes wals out of the house
1868556 brittany hides her emotions and has a hard time showing them because of dad
1868557 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president

1868561 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
1868562 hey the old dude still thinks his old wife is hot awww isnt that cute
1868563 oh ill check back later when shes less creepy and more frivilious or something
1868564 here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish but how far will they go among so many
1868565 gather the pieces that are left over let nothing be wasted so they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten

1868570 we have travelled to so many cities from olympia to the great wall we have cried so many times it is very emotional especially when you see the reaction of the chinese crowds
1868571 during the opening ceremony it will mainly be cloudy and there will essentially be no impact upon it
1868572 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1868573 united manager alex ferguson heard my arguments and i heard his and between the two of us we decided that the best thing for both parties was that i should stay at manchester united next season
1868574 hes never had a complaint about manchester united hes always been treated properly and i have a great relationship with the boy as do all the players
1868575 i think we can put this to bed now its finished the boys a united player and thats whats important
1868576 before any rumours emerge that im unhappy to stay at united i want to make one thing clear and that is that anyone who says that is lying
1868577 i will give my body and soul to manchester united i will be fighting to honour this shirt with the determination and dedication i have always shown
1868578 i want to make it clear that i was the one responsible for this controversy the directors of real madrid are not to blame because it was me who publicly voiced my willingness to sign for real i also ended up involuntarily being the reason for the conflict between the two clubs
1868579 i knew real madrid were interested and had allegedly made a high offer to united
1868580 for a while my intention was that united should accept to transfer me to real and to say anything else would be to deceive people and my own conscience

1868803 the linguistic use of egyptian aramaic and egyptian hebrew names is latterday patchwork
1868804 all this shifting play of correspondence by which everything is cheated of its individual logic creates a mood of pensive jesting and even sublime travesty by all the standards of genuine ancient knowledge this civilization which lays claim to being 3000 years into the future has not offered much in the way of a quantum jump over what our ancestors had 5000 years ago in the way of intellectual transformation

1868830 hey i am sitting around in my bra and underware i still need to shower make myself look all presentable and pack for the weekend
1868831 you may not believe this but i would like to apologize for antagonizing you last night theres too much to be done before all this hopeful however seemingly unlikely romanticism can take place so this time im going to let you talk tell me about her what you think of her anyway i already know enough about her inside so i figure it may be interesting to hear an outside perspective
1868832 well i can try to cough i can try to express my image of her but recently ive been writing these conversations out posting them online
1868833 i know but id like to hear your explanation as to why you might want to do such a thing and risk showing the fact that youre still affected in some way by her you know she reads them dont you
1868834 its hard to tell she said she did but i figured something ive said here that i posted might upset her seems like im waiting for an unpleasant reaction sometimes
1868835 she doesnt respond because she has no idea how to react to you when you dont speak to her for months and post things like our conversations can you really blame her that being said i suppose this is a good a time as any to confess my reasons for apologizing and asking you to speak your opinion i believe she needs to see it in all its honesty
1868836 if she really wanted to know everything i felt about her she wouldve asked
1868837 dont say things that you know very well arent true since when has she ever been one to outright ask you what you think on very few occasions and when you gave her an answer she became upset and swore she only asked how you were doing and not for your opinion of her she wanted to know what you thought she just didnt like the reality of what she did to you remember that occurred before you knew about well you know
1868838 ive given her more than enough opportunities to ask anything she wanted she never said a word i asked her if she had any thoughts she always said no and we drove on in silence
1868839 that has already been put behind the both of you you both found a new respect for each other and following that you havent given her any kind of opportunity to talk to you she wouldve loved to had talked when you visited last but what did you do you drank and vowed of an intention to do all in your power to never come back what the hell kind of message is that going to send the poor girl
1868840 woman shes not a girl anymore shes been a woman longer than most women are throughout their entire lives ive sworn myself away more times than i can count recently especially i am the last thing she needs in her life
1868841 youre the first thing she needs this life will not last forever shell grow tired of it you know her well enough to know this one thing you were always afraid to tell her is how affected you were by seeing her in the environment shes surrounded herself with
1868842 because i knew shed be terribly offended by it who wouldnt who am i to say whats right for her
1868843 no we went through that i am not her best friend
1868844 i didnt say best i said truest sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind you know that i know you dont like hearing all this from me because youve wanted to believe all the things i say for a very long time and here is what may very well be a product of your subconscious telling you everything you want to hear but i swear its true
1868845 if it were true things would never have turned out the way they did
1868846 im going to let you in on a little secret about her one youve considered but denied to save yourself from feeling self righteous she strays from you because of how close she feels to you how close youve made yourself and how invasive your passion is shes absolutely petrified of you as a result shes afraid that you know her too well david and if you take any truth from what i say let it be that she loves you like no one shes ever met now that isnt to say that she loves you romantically know this but you are to her what no one has ever been no one has ever been so clearly passionate about her in her entire life she even felt like she had to search c for that kind of affection wanted to believe in it so deeply that she risked more than youll ever know just to assume there was a true love within him
1868847 what good is all this information going to do me i can do nothing with it
1868848 come tomorrow evening youll go about posting this and feel compelled to spare no amount of detail so now lets move along speak
1868849 just speak as soon as you begin you will feel it pour out
1868850 your post this is where it will end actually you considered ending it a few moments ago when you looked at the clock but upon the realization of where this part fell you decided to continue for a moment so those that read it might find humor something these conversations tend to lack

1869013 the canadian nuclear industry is not disadvantaged on its home ground
1869014 thus we are potentially faced with a predatory financing situation
1869015 in order to ensure that aecl and team candu are competing on a level playing field with our competitors you will understand that it is imperative that equivalent financing support for the canadian bid be confirmed
1869016 i dont think we should be in the business of underbidding someone elses subsidized reactors
1869017 we would get a lot more bang for our buck by investing in conservation and green power than nuclear

1869030 there are only two natural sports racing and fighting all the rest are contrived
1869031 countries that share our democratic ideals should be natural partners of the united states yet when i took office our relations with many free nations in asia were strained
1869032 for example america has dramatically improved our ties with india the worlds largest democracy including a historic agreement on civilian nuclear energy
1869033 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1869034 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1869035 we seek an end to tyranny in burma this noble cause has many devoted champions and i happen to be married to one of them america reiterates our call on burmas military junta to release aung san suu kyi and all other political prisoners and we will continue working until the people of burma have the freedom they deserve

1869038 mike asda may be a big uk supermarket chain but it was taken over a few years ago and now advertises itself as part of the wal mart family so watch out they might be trialling a form of corporate blood sucking that will soon cross the pond
1869039 a couple of things first mikes viewpoint is from a smaller magazine viewpoint absolutely the small independent magazines would prefer not to deal with newsstand circulation and all the issues that this brings up
1869040 however from a large circulation magazines viewpoint remember i worked for a company that was putting out millions of units a month things actually work a bit differently
1869041 but newsstand sales do other things for magazines that are under appreciated
1869042 and since my name was used in a hypothetical question ill take it out of hypothetical yes a magazine could certainly treat nikon as thoroughly as i do indeed we have some close at hand examples of why i say that look no further than photoshop user and the empire scott kelby made from and around that with the right people making the right decisions it could be done for any niche including nikon users
1869043 the supermarket company is also demanding that any new title distributed in its stores will be subject to an
1869044 according to the email memo the supermarket is also requesting that a turnover bonus to the value of 2 of its magazine suppliers total business with asda be paid quarterly to the supermarket and backdated to january 1 2008
1869045 in addition to these charges asda is also seeking a
1869046 why does it take 4 6 weeks for the magazine to arrive at your doorstep once you subscribe
1869047 find the core market for your application and focus solely on them
1869048 the customer is not always right the truth is you have to sort out whos right and whos wrong for your app
1869049 if you try to please everyone you wont please anyone
1869050 by narrowing our market we made it more likely to attract passionate customers who in turn would evangelize the product know who your app is really intended for and focus on pleasing them
1869051 what does your app stand for whats it really all about before you start designing or coding anything you need to know the purpose of your product the vision think big why does it exist what makes it different than other similar products
1869052 this vision will guide your decisions and keep you on a consistent path
1869053 a diploma is sort of your ticket to success in the future
1869054 we are as patriotic as any company in america but our customers consistently tell us that our job is to help them control costs while still providing the highest quality products the imports have been unbeatable in both reguirements for as long as i can remember now

1869062 the civil rights issues in fiji do not boil down to a hindu muslim type of conflict
1869063 the hindus and the muslims in fiji live in peace and live in harmony
1869064 the conflicts that we have as hindus in fiji relates more to the fact that ethnic indians primarily hindu have been discriminated against in the last 10 20 years or so as a result of the ethnic fijians and their actions if anything the muslim community has suffered with us
1869065 the islamic colonization of kashmir has been supported by islamic terrorists and fundamentalists who committed crimes of genocide against the community of kashmiri hindus in kashmir including targeted attacks on sikh community
1869066 unfortunately indian leaders have been romancing with the islamists anti hindus and anti indians
1869067 so much so that the self confessed killers and anti nationalists they have been wandering scot free in the streets of kashmir the government of india has established two standards of justice one for indians one for kashmiri muslims
1869068 the george w bush administration has been cozying up to the taliban regime in the same way as the earlier administration of president bill clinton
1869069 thousands of kashmiris hindus have been murdered hindus are suffering and the government is silent
1869070 sad and painful portrayal of the exclusivist and illogical mindset that rules the roost in kashmir
1869071 the governments approach towards this issue is reflective of its subjugation to the islamic diktats which cannot be accepted
1869072 from 1957 what was a trickle of removal of rights became under the rule of dr mahathir mohammed a torrent a waterfall
1869073 what was a trickle of temple demolitions about 25 years ago has now grown and till now 15 000 hindu temples have been demolished
1869074 they have taken away our economic rights they have deprived us in education
1869075 if this goes on for the next five to 10 years there will be no more hindus all will either have left or will have forcibly converted to islam
1869076 currently we are in the process of trying to have another constitution put in place which essentially would go back to the original constitution which would allow race neutral policies
1869077 we were put in a position where all of a sudden we were interlopers and we did not belong
1869078 the second thing they did was to make people homeless individuals who had lived on the same land for three generations were forced to leave their lands and tear down their homes and go away now where would they go
1869079 so we have squatter camps that have developed around fiji
1869080 in fiji if you are fiji indian and a fijian came and robbed your home nobody would come
1869081 nobody would come to assist you if you have no personal safety or security in your own home you start feeling very frightened
1869082 the exclusionary policy of the last 20 years of keeping out indians making them feel not wanted has eventually helped to destroy the economy of fiji
1869083 understandably a lot of fiji indians are not interested in coming back
1869084 its a situation where the government may end up having to rebuild the homes of the fiji indians and thats something that we are hopeful will end up happening
1869085 the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 in the ocs access case is projected to be 1 6 percent higher than in the reference case and 3 percent higher in 2030 alone at 5 6 million barrels per day for the lower 48 ocs annual crude oil production in 2030 is projected to be 7 percent higher 2 4 million barrels per day in the ocs access case compared with 2 2 million barrels per day in the reference case figure 20 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant

1869088 het zicht op zee vanaf de wandelboulevard is er nu al minimaal dat wordt in de plannen van de gemeente alleen maar erger
1869089 in het gunstigste geval steken de strandtenten 1 40 meter boven de boulevard uit voor kinderen is er dus al geen lol meer aan volwassenen hebben nog maar een paar decimeter vrij zicht
1869090 voor de nieuwe boulevard worden de strandtenten geclusterd zegt een woordvoerder
1869091 dat hebben we juist speciaal gedaan om het zicht op zee te verbeteren

1869094 thats all good and nice that helping users learn is the key to creating passionate users but whos going to do all that extra work whos going to make the extra tutorials and better docs
1869095 why not spell out the rules clean and clear those who break them are booted
1869096 look on other third party forums where users are discussing which usually means struggling your product and find the most active people
1869097 turn this blog into a real group blog with a lot of authors and i would take more of an editorial role
1869098 creating passionate users is not about finding ways to make everyone like you its about finding ways to use your own passion to inspire passion in others and anything with that much power is bound to piss off plenty of status quo who moved my cheese people bring it on
1869099 is it a conference is it a company no one really knows
1869100 the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing
1869101 ive come up with something like blogging alone 25 years
1869102 hasnt been so fun for those whove stuck around either eh
1869103 hysteria half truths and out of context word manipulation have not only
1869104 it is difficult to write anything balanced about this without appearing to blame the victim and that is not at all what i am doing nevertheless at some point people need to be able to isolate root causes of the mob mentality that has effectively silenced some of the people who wrote as meankids what did kathy intend when she addressed her huge online audience with a post that conflated real threats with our parody and satiric criticism
1869105 im afraid that we have quite a ways to go before we reach true clarity on this concern but now three weeks after the curtain came down on meankids i am no longer afraid to write about it
1869106 jeneane do we need famous four spandex outfits and capes i miss alan im sure hell be back when hes all firewalled up
1869107 create a fake persona and write as that fake person
1869108 right now i couldnt pay anyone else so the blog would have to be sponsored to pay other authors
1869109 do something else on the blog podcasts video e books
1869110 this blog was because i love helping and teaching and learning from readers
1869111 the most popular and well loved companies products and causes have the strongest opponents
1869112 this blog was because i love helping and teaching and learning from readers
1869113 im not sure what else i can add to the conversation but i just want you to know that im one of your many supporters im appalled and sickened by whats happening and im really really sad
1869114 hey they will report us they stand together and if we continue we will be in trouble
1869115 do not fail because of adversity but succeed despite it
1869116 to become supremely successful as an online presence or personality you must accomplish both
1869117 i have never not once given one thought about how i might appear to search engines
1869118 unclear on the very concept you attempt to lecture us on
1869119 this is hard really frickin hard but well get you through it
1869120 we cant make this any easier or less scary but we can help you come out the other side
1869121 a short time ago i went on the sydney bridge climb at night
1869122 you are scared ok do it scared thats perfectly fine
1869123 i tell clients all the time you are scared ok do it scared thats perfectly fine
1869124 but not all scary things are like that you can help people overcome fear by breaking the process down into small manageable chunks that way they start to feel bigger and the scary thing starts to shrink
1869125 chinese rather than pizza more selection and mu shu lets you
1869126 update 3 let me be more specific i did not join or logon to uncebobism i did not add myself to the blog when i linked to the blog in this post it had a witty post about twitter by the time i got out of the hospital the blog was gone and i had not read it in days
1869127 yall are our invited guests but if youre being rude and obnoxious well let the bouncer toss you so please stick to debating and criticizing ideas rather than personal attacks
1869128 these people look dead do you like dead people roger do you like death
1869129 im going to start insulting who you are as a person
1869130 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
1869131 i swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation we must always take sides neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim silence encourages the tormentor never the tormented
1869132 my first reaction and probably yours is to think of course he doesnt actually mean it
1869133 this should be reported to the fbi which ive heard does a good job of tracking down and prosecuting those responsible for criminal cyber threats like this if theyre domestic
1869134 but when it was my turn somebody crossed a line
1869135 had kathy honestly framed it as book critics are attacking me this wouldnt get any air time
1869136 death threats over the internet because of your blog haha ha
1869137 it makes me wonder how many other bloggers and also how many other women in technology have faced similar problems and have tried to deal with it by themselves
1869138 having been a party to all that went on at both meankids and unclebobism and observing the fallout therefrom
1869139 i do not want to be part of a culture the blogosphere where this is considered acceptable
1869140 freedoms of speech and press do not permit a state to forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action whitney v california 274 u s 357 overruled
1869141 im not cowering in a closet im not changing my routine or my bank everybody knows where i am and who i am bring it on see what happens this time
1869142 thats one reason that ive typically used my po box as my mailing address
1869143 in the name of the best within you do not sacrifice this world to those who are its worst
1869144 that could have been me i am capable of equal atrocity

1869147 true fear is a gift unwarranted fear is a curse learn how to tell the difference
1869148 i will never feel the same i will never be the same
1869149 now shes reframed the timelines so that it appears she bumped into everything at once and it scared her other events dont line up either what shes making sound like happened in a few minutes was over the course of days youre being manipulated im sorry theres no other way to put it
1869150 i just didnt take them seriously i thought it was a poorly endowed chump with too much time on his hands it looked like harmless satire
1869151 like i said before its a marvellous pr campaign youve launched and no doubt youll get very wealthy very quickly because your adoring fans have been taken in completely by your peculiar brand of codswallop you have learned the lesson of never giving a sucker an even break to absolute perfection
1869152 you have learned the lesson of never giving a sucker an even break to absolute perfection
1869153 the only thing kathy has to offer me is that noose in her neck size
1869154 i hope someone slits your throat and cums down your gob
1869155 i guess my relatively high profile suited her purposes better than the truth
1869156 the fact that joey can turn around and candidly deny doing what he obviously did just makes it worse
1869157 trying to turn this around and saying 300 posters here are threatening you is pure bullshit
1869158 i mean arent you allowed to say whatever you want about anything you want dont we all want it this way
1869159 i guess my relatively high profile suited her purposes better than the truth
1869160 im retired that means im a useless probably toothless old man
1869161 well fine you win no more posting from me here you set the stage i handle this via the real media and lawyers
1869162 i do not want to be part of a culture where this is done not by some random person but by some of the most respected people in the tech blogging world people linked to by a listers like doc searls a co author of chris locke i do not want to be part of a culture of such hypocrisy where jeneane sessum can be a prominent member of blogher a speaker at industry conferences an outspoken advocate for womens rights and at the same time celebrate and encourage a site like meankids where objectification of women is taken to a level that makes plain old porn seem quaintly sweet
1869163 once more unto the breach dear friends once more or close the wall up with our english dead
1869164 reduce my fear or guilt and ill be grateful help me do something that really is scary and ill be grateful and exhilarated
1869165 in school we teach them that words are more damaging than actions as they stay with the person for much longer
1869166 im sorry if someone else was sending you nasty email truly that is always horrible no one at either site had anything to do with that i do not know who would even consider or encourage that sort of behaviour it is wrong but certainly youve been doing this a long time and have received one or two nasty emails by now
1869167 i mean arent you allowed to say whatever you want about anything you want dont we all want it this way

1869174 i will not fail because of you i will succeed despite you
1869175 holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else you are the one who gets burned
1869176 i wish i was some super hacker who could find all these people
1869177 the freedom to swing your fist ends at my nose
1869178 i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me

1869180 poorly photoshopped photo with a pair of pants on her head
1869181 i filled out a police report where all i have to do is go sign it and they will arrest you i dont want to do that and i wont do that as long as you keep to yourself and in return i will keep to myself
1869182 if youre going to let one stupid prick ruin your life youre not the girl i thought you were
1869183 you are not sure you are going to get a reward every time or how often you will so you keep pulling that handle
1869184 twittering fills in those gaps recording our friends feelings geographic location and actions as if we were spookily almost there that makes us feel really connected
1869185 to pay continuous partial attention is to pay partial attention continuously it is motivated by a desire to be a live node on the network another way of saying this is that we want to connect and be connected we want to effectively scan for opportunity and optimize for the best opportunities activities and contacts in any given moment to be busy to be connected is to be alive to be recognized and to matter we pay continuous partial attention in an effort not to miss anything it is an always on anywhere anytime any place behavior that involves an artificial sense of constant crisis we are always in high alert when we pay continuous partial attention this artificial sense of constant crisis is more typical of continuous partial attention than it is of multi tasking
1869186 its nice that im not too alone in the world

1869192 saya akan turunkan 12 ribu personil untuk pengamanan pilkada sumsel
1869193 a new generation of professionals well educated well trained and just the right amount of pissed off have taken up the mantle through advocacy to dissemble corrupt government at its core along with assuming the responsibility to educate train and mentor individuals to claim assert their unalienable rights whether in family courts in states courts in federal courts in states legislatures in federal legislature or most importantly at the ballot box
1869194 while i agree with your principle that it is time to find a way to assert some federal rights for fathers the courts have historically found that under the 10th amendment to the constitution regulating marriage and family matters are reserved to the states
1869195 the rooker feldman doctrine the court explained includes three requirements 1
1869196 the claim raised in the federal suit must have been actually raised or inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment

1869236 penolakan ini jangan disalahartikan sebagai bentuk penolakan terhadap pembangunan akan tetapi ini merupakan bentuk tanggungjawab kami untuk melindungi daerah dari kelangkaan air
1869237 selama izin lokasi belum dicabut maka kami belum tenang karena bisa saja sewaktu waktu perusahaan melakukan pembangunan secara diam diam

1869239 mereka bukan anti pembangunan seperti yang disinyalir banyak kalangan akan tetapi sikap ini sebagai bentuk moral terhadap nasib air di masa yang akan datang
1869240 makanya saya sedang menunggu dan mempelajari masalah ini dengan teliti supaya keputusan yang diambil tepat

1869275 if he had yes we probably would have helped out
1869276 he was so extremely malnourished he would not have been able to move around enough to sustain accidental injuries like these
1869277 that would happen over a period of time not just an hour or two
1869278 bruising of the ear is one of the first areas i look at
1869279 if there is bruising of the ear it elevates my concern
1869280 he would have been lethargic and i would have thought it would have been quite apparent that he was sick
1869281 it is something that will always stay in my memory the fact that he looked extremely malnourished i became very angry ive never seen anything like this ive had many days of emotional distress since then because of this

1869293 our fuel costs have more than doubled in the past year
1869294 in order to manage through this unprecedented fuel challenge we have to take action to both control costs and increase our revenue

1869300 marburg is already a leader when it comes to the use of solar energy but up until now theyve always tried to convince people rather than forcing them
1869301 its unfortunate that they decided to compel people because i think you breed opponents that way rather than friends of solar energy
1869302 good thing about the heightened awareness now is that at least some of these soldiers names are getting out there
1869303 if anything good is coming out of that media attention its that people see that they are truly human its not just numbers its actually brothers and sons and fathers theyre human

1869324 as you are aware some neighbors dont like anything our church does and seek to stir up problems where ever possible
1869325 you should park around the church property if there are spaces available
1869326 if not all streets are public and you have a perfect right to park wherever there is a legal space no property owner has a right to a space in front of their house
1869327 keep your car parked there and tell them youll convey their comments to the pastor
1869328 i guess some folks would prefer not having the church in the neighborhood were doing the best we can
1869329 i think everyone here knows sundays are going to be a problem with parking and wednesday night when the choir practices

1869525 and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ
1869526 and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day
1869527 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them
1869528 and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
1869529 and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
1869530 and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
1869531 therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath

1869539 the works of his hands are verity and judgment all his commandments are sure they stand fast for ever and ever and are done in truth and uprightness
1869540 and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail
1869541 the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honourable
1869542 how much then is a man better than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days

1869720 what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats

1869739 the demonstrators who had gathered on the theatrical square were going to be supplied with fire arms grenades explosives iron sticks and clubs and provocative acts were going to be organized this issue was discussed in the police and a task was set to examine and explore the site accordingly a plan of actions was drawn up at a quarter to 7 in the morning the police forces were deployed along the adjacent streets and the operative groups prepared for examining the site
1869740 all this is a fact there are proofs and relevant video materials are available unfortunately the operations of the police officers were impeded threats and abuses were hurled then they began throwing stones at the policemen and using the iron sticks 1 5 meters long and clubs i was responsible for ensuring public order and i insist that the policemen and the officers of the operative services were unarmed it was only at a quarter past 7 that the auxiliary forces deployed along the street were instructed to intervene restore the public trust and help the operative forces carry out their task
1869741 the fact has to be clarified through the special investigative service definitely all the demonstrators had been warned about everything on the previous day and they were aware that the police were going to examine the site this fact was also confirmed by the criminal case which was instituted thereafter we also have a convict thus all the demonstrators were prepared supplied with arms they were waiting for the police forces and started military operations with us this is a fact the statement that the police complied with an instruction to clear the square is a lie as a result of exploring the site arms iron stick grenades and bottles filled with petrol were discovered if there had been an instruction for dispersing the peaceful demonstrators we would have gone there with special means and water pouring vehicles we went there for exploring the site this information is precise and unequivocal
1869742 i supervised the operation and the instructions were given by me
